Company Overview 
 Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 27, 2007 and formerly known as Innovative Acquisitions Corp., together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Puma Biotechnology Ltd and Puma Biotechnology B.V.., and all references to “Former Puma” refer to Puma Biotechnology, Inc., a privately-held Delaware corporation formed on September 15, 2010, that merged with and into us in October 2011. We refer to this transaction as the “Merger.” 
 We are a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. We in-license the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates – PB272 (neratinib, oral), PB272 (neratinib, intravenous) and PB357. Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the human epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4.  Currently, we are primarily focused on the U.S. commercialization of NERLYNX (neratinib), our first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved product, and on the further development of the oral version of neratinib for additional indications in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. We believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2. Until recently, we have focused our efforts and resources primarily on obtaining regulatory approval for NERLYNX (neratinib) and on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies, raising capital and recruiting personnel.
 In July 2017, we received regulatory approval of our first product, NERLYNX (neratinib), formally known as PB 272 (neratinib (oral)), for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early state HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy from the FDA.  After receiving FDA approval, we commenced commercialization of NERLYNX in the United States using a direct sales force.
 In September 2018, the European Commission, or EC, granted marketing authorization for our Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, which was filed in July 2016 for the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage hormone receptor positive HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab based therapy.  Additionally, we are in the process of applying for or awaiting approval in many of the territories for which we have entered into exclusive license agreements with partners.  We have license agreements with Specialised Therapeutics Asia Pte Ltd., or STA, Medison Pharma Ltd., or Medison, CANbridgepharma Limited, or CANbridge, Pint Pharma International SA, or Pint, and Knight Therapeutics, or Knight, to pursue regulatory approval and commercialize NERLYNX, if approved, in various specified regions outside of the United States.  We plan to continue to pursue commercialization of NERLYNX in other countries throughout the world, if approved, and will evaluate various commercialization options in those countries, including developing a direct sales force, contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities, or some combination of these two options.  We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase should we choose to develop a direct sales force outside the United States.
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide.  Studies show that approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancer tumors have an over-expression of the HER2 protein. Women with breast cancer that over-expresses HER2, referred to as HER2-positive breast cancer, are at greater risk for disease progression and death than women whose tumors do not over-express HER2. Therapeutic strategies, such as the use of trastuzumab (marketed as Herceptin), pertuzumab (marketed as Perjeta) and T-DM1 (marketed as Kadcyla), each produced by Genentech, and lapatinib (marketed as Tykerb) produced by Novartis, given either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have been developed to improve the treatment of this type of breast cancer by binding to the HER2 protein. There are a number of trials ongoing that involve various combinations of these drugs (for example, Perjeta). Based on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe that neratinib may offer an advantage over existing treatments by more potently inhibiting HER2 at a different site and using a different mechanism than these other drugs. 
 In February 2013, we reached agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, for our Phase III clinical trial of PB272 in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior lines of HER2-directed treatments (third-line disease) in the setting of metastatic disease. The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has provided follow-on scientific advice consistent with that of the FDA regarding our ability to use the trial to support regulatory approval in the European Union, or EU. We refer to this trial as PUMA-NER-1301, or the NALA trial. The trial enrolled 621 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive either neratinib plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The trial was conducted globally at sites in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are centrally confirmed progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. An alpha level of 1% was allocated to the PFS and 4% allocated to OS. The study was to be considered positive if either of the co-primary endpoints was positive.  In December 2018, we announced that for the primary analysis of centrally confirmed PFS, treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in centrally confirmed PFS (p=0.0059) compared to treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine. For the primary analyses of OS, neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a numerical improvement in OS that did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.21). For the secondary endpoint of time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system disease (also referred to as brain metastases), the results of the trial showed that treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine led to an improvement over the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine (p=0.043).
 2

Additionally, in December 2016, we initiated a managed access program for neratinib. Managed access programs provide physicians and patients access to medicines when there are limited or no other therapeutic options available. Our managed access program for neratinib enables participation from countries outside the United States, including European Union member states, where permitted by applicable rules, procedures and regulatory authorities. The program provides access to neratinib for the treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer (extended adjuvant setting), HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer and HER2-mutated solid tumors. In order for patients to qualify for our managed access program they must be unable to participate in any ongoing neratinib clinical trial. Patients in the managed access program are given neratinib and are instructed to take a prophylaxis during treatment to manage neratinib-related diarrhea, which consists of high dose loperamide and budesonide.  We have partnered with Caligor Opco LLC, which specializes in early access to medicines, to oversee the managed access program for neratinib. 
 In addition to continuing to follow the patients from the ExteNET trial, which was our Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, as well as patients from the NALA trial, we are actively conducting the following trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib in various indications:
  
• | a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer who have received prior adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin)-based therapy in which patients are given either: 1) antidiarrheal prophylaxis including loperamide alone or in combination with budesonide or other agents or 2) escalating doses of neratinib during the first month (dose titration)in order to prevent and reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib in combination with the drug ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, Kadcyla) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib monotherapy or in combination with the drug trastuzumab and or other anticancer drugs in the treatment of patients with HER2-negative cancers that have a HER2 mutation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib monotherapy in the treatment of solid tumors that have an activating EGFR exon 18, or HER4 mutation; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a Phase I/II trial of neratinib plus Kadcyla in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We license the commercial rights to our current drug candidates from Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer, which had previously been responsible for the clinical trials regarding neratinib.  Going forward, we expect to augment our product pipeline by acquiring, through license or otherwise, additional drug candidates for research and development, and potential commercialization.  In evaluating potential drug candidates, we employ disciplined decision criteria that favor drug candidates that have undergone at least some clinical study. Our decision to acquire a drug candidate will also depend on our evaluation of the scientific merits of the underlying technology, the costs of the transaction and other economic terms of any proposed license, the amount of capital that we anticipate will be required to develop the drug candidate and the economic potential of the drug candidate if approved for commercialization.  We believe this strategy minimizes our clinical development risk and allows us to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of current and future drug candidates.
 Strategy 
 Our primary objective is to build neratinib into a significant oncology franchise as a single agent, and potentially in combination with other therapies. The following elements comprise our strategy to achieve this objective: 

• | Seek regulatory approval and commence commercialization of neratinib in regions outside the United States. Before we can market neratinib outside the United States for any indication, including the FDA-approved indication associated with NERLYNX, we must obtain regulatory approval in those countries. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with STA, Medison, Pint, CANbridge, and Knight pursuant to which each will commercialize NERLYNX in its respective territory. Pursuant to these agreements, we have received upfront payments and will potentially receive regulatory milestone and sales-based milestone payments, and royalties based on net sales of NERLYNX once commercialized. In June 2016, we submitted an MAA to the EMA for neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer who have received prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. The MAA submission was based upon the results of the ExteNET trial, which reached its primary endpoint whereby neratinib demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo. In September 2018, the EC granted marketing authorisation for extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early state hormone receptor positive HER-2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer and who are less than one year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. We are continuing to also evaluate potential commercialization options for the extended adjuvant setting in additional countries outside the United States, including developing a direct sales force, contracting with third parties to provide sales and marketing capabilities, some combination of these two options or other strategic options. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Continue to advance the development of neratinib for the treatment of other HER2-positive or HER2 mutated breast cancer indications. We are primarily focused on developing neratinib for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer or HER2-negative cancers with a HER2 mutation. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our product pipeline by pursuing additional applications of neratinib. We believe there are additional applications for neratinib in the treatment of patients with HER2-negative cancers who have a HER2 mutation; and in tumor types where HER2 is over-expressed or mutated. We intend to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of neratinib for treating these cancers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and disciplined decision criteria based on clearly defined proof of principal goals. We seek to build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and by acquiring drug candidates belonging to known drug classes. In addition, we employ disciplined decision criteria to assess drug candidates, favoring drug candidates that have undergone at least some clinical study. Our decision to license a drug candidate will also depend on the scientific merits of the technology; the costs of the transaction and other economic terms of the proposed license; the amount of capital required to develop the technology; and the economic potential of the drug candidate, should it be commercialized. We believe this strategy minimizes our clinical development risk and allows us to accelerate the development and potential commercialization of current and future drug candidates. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for a majority of our drug candidates in multiple indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the commercialization strategies on a product-by-product basis in order to maximize the value of each. We are currently commercializing NERLYNX using a direct sales force in the United States and using out-licenses in certain countries outside of the United States. As we move additional drug candidates through development toward regulatory approval, we plan to evaluate several options for each drug candidate’s commercialization strategy. These options include building our own internal sales force; entering into a joint marketing partnership with another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, whereby we jointly sell and market the product; and out-licensing our product, whereby another pharmaceutical or biotechnology company sells and markets our product and pays us a royalty on sales. Our decision may be different for each product that reaches commercialization and will be based on a number of factors including capital necessary to execute on each option, size of the market to be addressed and terms of potential offers from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

Breast Cancer Overview 
 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide, with approximately 1 million new cases reported each year and more than 400,000 deaths per year. Approximately 20% to 25% of breast cancer tumors show over-expression of the HER2 protein. Women with breast cancer that over-expresses HER2 are at greater risk for disease progression and death than women whose tumors do not over-express HER2. Therapeutic strategies have been developed to block HER2 in order to improve the treatment of this type of breast cancer. 
 Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib and T-DM1 are all drugs that bind to the HER2 protein and thereby cause the cells to cease reproducing. Today, these drugs are used as single agents, in combination with other drugs and in combination with chemotherapy to treat patients with HER2-positive breast cancer at various stages.  
 Currently, the only treatment approved by the FDA for the treatment of neoadjuvant (newly diagnosed) HER2-positive breast cancer is the combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy.  The FDA-approved therapy for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early stage breast cancer is the combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab and chemotherapy.   In addition, in December 2018, a Phase III clinical trial showed that Kadcyla significantly improved invasive disease-free survival compared to Herceptin in patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment. We are also aware of a Phase III clinical trial that is comparing trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus taxane following anthracyclines versus T-DM1 plus pertuzumab following anthracyclines as an adjuvant therapy. 
 Trastuzumab and pertuzumab given in combination with taxane chemotherapy is the current first-line standard of care for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  Lapatinib (Tykerb), given in combination with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine, is also FDA-approved for the treatment of patients who have failed prior treatments. In a Phase II clinical trial, lapatinib demonstrated a median PFS of eight to nine weeks and a response rate of 5 – 7%.  In a Phase III clinical trial, patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who received the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine demonstrated a median progression free survival of 27.1 weeks and a response rate of 23.7%.  In the Phase III EMILIA trial, the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine demonstrated a median PFS of 25.6 weeks and a response rate of 30.8%.  T-DM1 is approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who previously received first line trastuzumab-based therapy.  Unfortunately, the disease eventually progresses for most patients with HER2-positive breast cancer while on these treatments. For these reasons, there is a need for alternatives to block HER2 signaling in patients who fail treatment with prior HER2 directed treatments. Neratinib is an orally active small molecule that inhibits HER2 at a different site and uses a different mechanism than trastuzumab. As a result, we believe that neratinib may have utility in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed treatment with other HER2 inhibitors.

We believe that there are approximately 28,300 patients in the United States and 37,000 patients in the EU with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer that get treated with adjuvant treatment.  Based on our internal estimates, we believe that the worldwide Herceptin adjuvant revenue was approximately $4.5 to $5.0 billion in 2015. We also believe that there are approximately 6,400 patients in the United States with third-line and 4,700 patients in the United States with fourth line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The number of patients with third-line or later HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer may decrease in future years as the introduction of new neoadjuvant, adjuvant and extended adjuvant treatments may reduce the number of patients with recurrence of HER2 positive breast cancer and therefore reduce the number of patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  In 2017, worldwide sales of Tykerb for this indication were approximately $186 million.  
 We believe that approximately 1-12% of all cancer patients have mutation in HER2 kinase in the United States and that approximately 7 – 9% of all estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patients who have received prior endocrine treatment have a mutation in HER2 kinase (approximately 8,000 to 10,000 patients in the United States). 
 Product Development Pipeline 
 The following chart shows each of our current drug candidates and their clinical development stage.  

Neratinib
 Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4.  Based on pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to date, we believe that neratinib may offer an advantage over existing treatments that are used in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed prior treatments, including treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and T-DM1. Currently, the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients involves treatment with these agents either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. We believe that by more potently inhibiting HER2 at a different site and acting via a mechanism different from other agents, neratinib may have therapeutic benefits in patients who have failed these existing treatments, most notably due to its increased selectivity and irreversible inhibition of the HER2 target enzyme.
 In addition, we believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2.  
 Our initial focus is on the commercialization and development of the oral formulation of neratinib.  We are also evaluating for potential development an intravenous formulation of neratinib and PB357, a back-up compound to neratinib.

PB272 (neratinib oral)—Early Stage Breast Cancer 
 Extended Adjuvant Breast Cancer
 Two-Year ExteNET Data.  In July 2014, we announced top line results from our ExteNET trial, a Phase III clinical trial of neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer. The data from this trial was presented in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, ,Annual Meeting in June 2015 and was published online in The Lancet Oncology in February 2016. The ExteNET trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of neratinib versus placebo after adjuvant treatment with Herceptin in women with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer.  More specifically, the ExteNET trial enrolled 2,840 patients in 41 countries with early stage HER2-positive breast cancer who had undergone surgery and adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab. After completion of adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab, patients were randomized to receive extended adjuvant treatment with either neratinib or placebo for a period of one year. Patients were then followed for recurrent disease, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or death for a period of two years after randomization in the trial.  
 The safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event for the neratinib-treated patients was diarrhea, with approximately 39.9% of the neratinib-treated patients experiencing grade 3 or higher diarrhea (one patient, 0.1%, had grade 4 diarrhea). Patients who received neratinib in this trial did not receive any prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents to prevent the neratinib-related diarrhea. We have reported clinical data from several trials that have demonstrated that the use of high-dose prophylactic loperamide may greatly reduce the rate of grade 3 diarrhea with neratinib, with grade 3 diarrhea rates ranging from 0-17% in studies in which high-dose loperamide prophylaxis was used.  We are currently conducting an international, open-label, Phase II study investigating the use of antidiarrheal prophylaxis with loperamide alone or with other agents in the prevention and reduction of neratinib-associated diarrhea and, more specifically, grade 3 diarrhea.  The interim results of this trial (data cut-off of November 2017) showed that the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea for the 137 patients who received the loperamide prophylaxis was 30.7% , the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea for the 64 patients who received the combination of loperamide plus budesonide was 26.6% and the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea for the 120 patients who received the combination of loperamide plus colestipol was 10.8%.   In all of our current ongoing studies, we are instituting the use of antidiarrheal prophylaxis for the first cycle of treatment in order to continue to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea.  See “—PB272 (neratinib, oral)—Metastatic Breast Cancer—Safety Database” for additional information.
 The primary endpoint of the ExteNET trial was invasive disease-free survival, or DFS. The results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 33% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.67, p = 0.009). The two-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.9% and the two-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 91.6%. The secondary endpoint of the trial was disease-free survival including ductal carcinoma in situ, or DFS-DCIS. The results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 37% reduction of risk of disease recurrence including DCIS or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.63, p = 0.002). The two-year DFS-DCIS rate for the neratinib arm was 93.9% and the two-year DFS-DCIS rate for the placebo arm was 91.0%.
 As an inclusion criteria for the ExteNET trial, patients needed to have tumors that were HER2-positive using local assessment. In addition, as a pre-defined subgroup in the trial, patients had centralized HER2 testing performed on their tumor as well. At the time the two-year data was compiled, centralized HER2 testing had been performed on 1,704 (60%) of the patients in the ExteNET trial and further central testing on available samples was currently ongoing. For the 1,463 patients whose tumors were HER2-positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 49% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51, p = 0.002). The two-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 94.7% and the 2-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 90.6%. For the patients in the trial whose tumors were HER2-positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 51% reduction of risk of disease recurrence including DCIS or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.49, p < 0.001). The two-year DFS-DCIS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 94.7% and the two-year DFS rate for centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 90.2%. 
 For the pre-defined subgroup of patients with hormone receptor positive disease, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 49% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.51, p = 0.001). The two-year DFS rate for the neratinib arm was 95.4% and the two-year DFS rate for the placebo arm was 91.2%. For the patients in the trial whose tumors were HER2-positive by central confirmation, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 75% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death (hazard ratio = 0.25, p < 0.001). The two-year DFS rate for the centrally confirmed patients in the neratinib arm was 97.0% and the two-year DFS rate for centrally confirmed patients in the placebo arm was 88.4%.
 Based on the results from the ExteNET trial, in June and July 2016, we submitted an MAA with the EMA and filed an NDA with the FDA, respectively, for regulatory approval of neratinib in the extended adjuvant setting.

Five-Year ExteNET Data.  In September 2017, we presented updated data from the ExteNET trial at the European Society of Medical Oncology, or ESMO, 2017 Congress in Madrid, Spain.  The data represented a predefined five-year invasive disease free survival, or iDFS, analysis as a follow-up to the primary two-year iDFS analysis of the Phase III ExteNet trial. The results of the trial demonstrated that after a median follow up of 5.2 years, treatment with neratinib resulted in a 27% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.73, p = 0.008). The five-year iDFS rate for the neratinib arm was 90.2% and the 5-year iDFS rate for the placebo arm was 87.7%.  The secondary endpoint of the trial was invasive disease free survival including ductal carcinoma in situ, or iDFS-DCIS. The results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 29% reduction of risk of disease recurrence, including DCIS or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.71, p = 0.004). The five-year iDFS-DCIS rate for the neratinib arm was 89.7% and the five-year iDFS-DCIS rate for the placebo arm was 86.8%.
 For the pre-defined subgroup of patients with hormone receptor positive disease, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a 40% reduction of risk of invasive disease recurrence or death versus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.60, p = 0.002). The five-year iDFS rate for the neratinib arm was 91.2% and the five-year iDFS rate for the placebo arm was 86.8%. For the pre-defined subgroup of patients with hormone receptor negative disease, the results of the trial demonstrated that treatment with neratinib resulted in a hazard ratio of 0.95 (p = 0.762).
 The results of the ExteNET trial showed that after two years of follow-up, for patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2-positive early stage breast cancer patients who were treated within one year after the completion of trastuzumab based adjuvant therapy, iDFS was 95.3% in the patients treated with neratinib compared with 90.8% in those receiving placebo (hazard ratio = 0.49; 95% CI: (0.30, 0.78); p=0.002).
 The safety results were unchanged from the primary two-year iDFS analysis of the study that showed the most frequently observed adverse event for the neratinib-treated patients was diarrhea, with approximately 39.9% of the neratinib-treated patients experiencing grade 3 or higher diarrhea (one patient, or 0.1%, had grade 4 diarrhea). Patients who received neratinib in this trial did not receive any prophylaxis with antidiarrheal agents to prevent the neratinib-related diarrhea.
 Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer
 At the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the results of the Neoadjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation Study, or the Neo-ALTTO study, were presented. In this trial, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, the combination of paclitaxel plus lapatinib or the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib, as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. The results of the trial demonstrated that patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab demonstrated a pathological complete response rate, or pCR, of 27.6% in the breast and lymph nodes, the patients who received paclitaxel plus lapatinib had a pCR of 20.0% and the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib had a pCR of 46.8%. 
 Also at the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, the results of the Neo-Sphere study were presented. In this trial, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab, the combination of docetaxel plus pertuzumab, the combination of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab or the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, as a neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy. The results of the trial demonstrated that the patients who received the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab had a pCR of 21.5% in the breast and lymph nodes, the patients who received docetaxel plus pertuzumab had a pCR of 17.7%, the patients who received pertuzumab plus trastuzumab had a pCR of 11.2% and the patients who received the combination of docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab had a pCR of 39.3%. 
 I-SPY 2 TRIAL. In 2010, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health initiated the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial Studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular Analysis 2). The I-SPY 2 TRIAL is a randomized Phase II clinical trial for women with newly diagnosed Stage 2 or higher (tumor size at least 2.5 cm) breast cancer that addresses whether adding investigational drugs to standard chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting is better than standard chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pCR in the breast and the lymph nodes at the time of surgery. The goal of the trial was to match investigational regimens with patient subsets on the basis of molecular characteristics, referred to as biomarker signatures, that benefit from the regimen. 
 The I-SPY 2 TRIAL involved an adaptive trial design based on Bayesian predictive probability that a regimen will be shown to be statistically superior to standard therapy in an equally randomized 300-patient confirmatory trial. Regimens that have a high Bayesian predictive probability of showing superiority in at least one of 10 predefined signatures graduate from the trial. Regimens are dropped for futility if they show a low predictive probability of showing superiority over standard therapy in all 10 signatures. A maximum total of 120 patients can be assigned to each experimental regimen. A regimen can graduate early and at any time after having 60 patients assigned to it.

In April 2014, we announced the results for the neratinib-containing regimen of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL.  The neratinib-containing regimen (neratinib plus paclitaxel followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) graduated from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL based on having a high probability of success in Phase III with a signature of HER2 positive/HR negative. In this group, treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 55.6% compared to the control arm (standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy: paclitaxel in combination with trastuzumab followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide), which had an estimated pCR rate of 32.6%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen (compared to standard therapy) is 94.9%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.051. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, both followed by doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, is 79.1%.
 For the 65 patients in the trial who were HER2 positive (including those who were either hormone receptor positive or negative), treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 39.4% compared to the control arm, which demonstrated an estimated pCR rate of 22.8%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen is 95.4%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.046. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel plus trastuzumab is 72.7%.
 Patients in the I-SPY 2 TRIAL were screened using the MammaPrint 70-gene signature test to determine if they had a heightened risk of breast cancer recurrence. The median MammaPrint score from the patients in the previous I-SPY 1 TRIAL who fit the eligibility criteria for I-SPY 2 was used as a predefined stratification factor for the I-SPY 2 TRIAL. Patients in I-SPY 2 were stratified as either MammaPrint High (below the median from I-SPY 1) or MammaPrint Ultra High (above the median from I-SPY 1). For the 41 neratinib treated patients in the trial who were MammaPrint Ultra High (80.5% of whom were HER2 negative), treatment with the neratinib-containing regimen resulted in an estimated pCR rate of 47.5% compared to the control arm, which demonstrated an estimated pCR rate of 29.4%. The Bayesian probability of superiority for the neratinib-containing regimen is 93.3%, which is analogous to a p-value of 0.067. In addition, the Bayesian predictive probability of showing statistical superiority in a 300-patient Phase III randomized trial of paclitaxel plus neratinib versus paclitaxel alone for HER2-negative patients, or in combination with trastuzumab for the HER2-positive patients, is 71.8%.
 The results of the I-SPY2 TRIAL with neratinib were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2016. 
 FB-7 Trial.  In 2010, Pfizer, in collaboration with the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, or NSABP, a clinical trials cooperative group supported by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, initiated the FB-7 study to investigate the use of neratinib as a neoadjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer. In this trial, a total of 126 patients were randomized to receive neratinib plus the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel prior to having surgery to remove their tumors. The purpose of this study was to test whether adding neratinib to paclitaxel chemotherapy is better than trastuzumab plus paclitaxel chemotherapy before having surgery. This trial was modified in 2012 to include a third treatment arm where patients will receive the combination of neratinib plus trastuzumab plus paclitaxel prior to having surgery to remove their tumors. 
 Data from this trial were presented at the 2015 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.  Patients were randomly assigned to trastuzumab (T) or neratinib (N) or the combination (T+N) with weekly paclitaxel (P) followed by standard doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (AC) administered prior to surgery.  126 U.S., Canadian, and European patients were randomly assigned to Arm 1 (T+P followed by AC), Arm 2 (N+P followed by AC) or Arm 3 (T+N+P followed by AC).  The primary endpoint of the trial was pathological complete response rate (pCR) in the breast and lymph nodes.  Tumor tissue was collected on patients at the time of diagnosis. This tissue will be analyzed for several biomarkers including AKT, cMET, EGFR, ESR-alpha, HER2, HER3, HER4, p95 HER2 and PI3K and intrinsic subtypes. A key secondary endpoint of this trial is the molecular and genetic correlates of response for each of these biomarkers. 
 For the intent-to-treat patient population (hormone receptor positive (HR+) and hormone receptor negative (HR-)), the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 38.1%, for Arm 2 was 33.3% and for Arm 3 was 50.0%. For the HR+ patients, the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 29.6%, for Arm 2 was 27.6% and for Arm 3 was 30.4%. For the HR- patients, the pCR rate for Arm 1 was 57.1%, for Arm 2 was 46.2% and for Arm 3 was 73.7%.
 The most frequently observed severe adverse event in the two neratinib treated arms of the trial (Arm 2 and Arm 3) was diarrhea. In the first 19 patients treated in Arm 2 of the trial, high dose loperamide (16 mg per day initially) as primary prophylaxis was not given to prevent the neratinib-related diarrhea. In this subset of patients the grade 3 diarrhea rate was 42% (8/19). In the next 10 patients treated in Arm 2 and the first 20 patients treated in Arm 3, high dose primary prophylaxis (16 mg per day initially) with loperamide was given during the initial two weeks of the first cycle of treatment. Using two weeks of intensive loperamide prophylactically, the grade 3 diarrhea rate in Arm 2 was 30% (3/10) and the grade 3 diarrhea rate in Arm 3 was 35% (7/20). In the next 13 patients in Arm 2 and 22 patients in Arm 3, high dose prophylaxis (16 mg per day initially) was given for the entire first cycle of treatment (4 weeks). The grade 3 diarrhea rate was 15% (2/13) in Arm 2 and 23% (5/22) in Arm 3.

In December 2016, a biomarker analysis of the FB-7 trial was presented at the 2016 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.  Pre-treatment core biopsy samples (n=59) and post treatment surgical samples (n=17) were obtained from a subset of patients treated in the FB-7 trial. pCR data were available for 51 patients from the biomarker cohort. After excluding low tumor content non-evaluable samples, correlative biomarker analysis was performed in 42 patients.
 Expression levels and the activation status of EGFR/HER2 signaling proteins were investigated. The results of the phosphorylated HER2 (phosphoHER2) showed that median levels of phosphoHER2 were higher in the patients who achieved a pCR with neratinib (n=7) than in the patients who did not achieve a pCR who received either trastuzumab (n=8, p=0.07) or the combination of trastuzumab plus neratinib (n=4, p=0.035). There was not a significant difference in the median levels of phosphoHER2 in the patients who achieved a pCR with neratinib (n=7), trastuzumab (n=8, p=0.16) or the combination of trastuzumab plus neratinib (n=4, p=0.10).
 The truncated form of HER2 known as p95HER2 was measured by the proprietary assay of Pierian Bioscience. p95HER2 represents a truncated form of the HER2 receptor that lacks the extracellular trastuzumab binding domain. It is believed to represent a mechanism of trastuzumab resistance. Median p95HER2 levels were higher in samples from patients who achieved a pCR with neratinib than in the patients who did not achieve a pCR and who received either trastuzumab (p=0.027) or the combination of trastuzumab plus neratinib (p=0.009). There was not a significant difference in the median levels of p95HER2 in the patients who achieved a pCR with neratinib (n=7), trastuzumab (n=8, p=0.16) or the combination of trastuzumab plus neratinib (n=4, p=0.35).
 The MammaPrint assay was performed on 59 samples to determine if there was any imbalance between arms. This assay is a genomic test that analyzes the activity of 70 genes and then calculates a recurrence score that is either low risk or high risk. The results of the MammaPrint showed that the patients in all three arms of the FB-7 trial were balanced with the median MammaPrint risk score being similar across arms. There were only three patients with a MammaPrint low score.
 PB272 (neratinib, oral)—Metastatic Breast Cancer 
 Trials of Neratinib as a Single Agent. In 2009, Pfizer presented data at the CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium from a Phase II trial of neratinib administered as a single agent to patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Final results from this trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in March 2010. 
 The trial involved a total of 136 patients, 66 of whom had received prior treatment with trastuzumab and 70 of whom had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab. The results of the study showed that neratinib was reasonably well-tolerated among both the pretreated patients and the patients who had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab. Diarrhea was the most common side effect, but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification. Efficacy results from the trial showed that the objective response rate was 24% for patients who had received prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Furthermore, the median PFS was 22.3 weeks for the patients who had received prior trastuzumab and 39.6 weeks for the patients who had not received prior trastuzumab. 
 Other Trials of Neratinib in Combination with Other Anti-Cancer Drugs. In November 2014, we announced top line results from a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib for the treatment of first-line HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (NEfERTT trial). Data from this trial was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2015 Annual Meeting in June 2015.  The NEfERTT trial was a randomized, two-arm Phase II trial of neratinib plus the anticancer drug paclitaxel versus trastuzumab (Herceptin) plus paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.  The trial enrolled 479 patients in 33 countries with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received prior anticancer therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients were randomized to receive first-line treatment with either paclitaxel plus neratinib or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. The primary endpoint of the trial was progression free survival. The secondary endpoints of the study included objective response rate and the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases, including brain metastases.
 The results of the trial demonstrated that the PFS for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib was 12.9 months and the PFS for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 12.9 months (p=0.777). The objective response rate in the trial for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib was 74.8% and the objective response rate for the patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 77.6% (p=0.522).  With respect to the incidence of central nervous system, or CNS, metastases, such as brain metastases, treatment with the combination of paclitaxel plus neratinib resulted in a 52% reduction in the incidence of CNS metastases compared to the incidence of CNS metastases in patients who received the combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. Symptomatic or progressive CNS recurrences occurred in 20 patients (8.3%) in the neratinib-paclitaxel group and 41 patients (17.3%) in the trastuzumab-paclitaxel group (relative risk 0.48, p=0.002). The estimated Kaplan-Meier 2-year incidence of CNS recurrences was 16.3% in the neratinib-paclitaxel group and 31.2% in the trastuzumab-paclitaxel group (hazard ratio 0.45, p=0.004). These results reflect a statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms.  We believe that this represents the first randomized trial with a HER2 targeted agent that has shown a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of CNS metastases.  The Phase II trial results were published online in the JAMA Oncology in April 2016.

Pfizer presented data from a Phase II trial at the 2010 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of neratinib when given in combination with the anti-cancer drug vinorelbine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In the 56 patients who had not been previously treated with the anti-HER2 therapy lapatinib, treatment with the combination of vinorelbine plus neratinib resulted in an overall response rate of 57% and PFS was 44.1 weeks. For those patients who had received prior treatment with lapatinib, the overall response rate was 50%. The combination of vinorelbine and neratinib was generally well tolerated. 
 Data from a third Phase II study, in which patients with confirmed HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had failed treatment with trastuzumab and taxane chemotherapy were given neratinib in combination with capecitabine, was presented at the 2011 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The results of the study showed that the combination of PB272 and capecitabine had acceptable tolerability. The efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 61 patients in the trial who had not been previously treated with the HER2 targeted anti-cancer drug lapatinib, there was an overall response rate of 64% and a clinical benefit rate of 72%. In addition, for the seven patients in the trial who had previously been treated with lapatinib, there was an overall response rate of 57% and a clinical benefit rate of 71%. The median PFS for patients who had not received prior treatment with lapatinib was 40.3 weeks and the median PFS for the patients who had received prior lapatinib treatment was 35.9 weeks. 
 In February 2013, we reached agreement with the FDA under an SPA for our Phase III clinical trial (PUMA-NER-1301 or the NALA trial) of neratinib in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed two or more prior treatments (third-line disease). The SPA is a written agreement between us, as the trial’s sponsor, and the FDA regarding the design, endpoints, and planned statistical analysis of the Phase III trial with respect to the effectiveness of PB272 for the indication to be studied to support an NDA. The EMA has also provided follow-on SA, consistent with that of the FDA regarding our Phase III trial design and endpoints to be used and ability of such design to support the submission of an MAA in the EU. 
 Pursuant to the SPA and SA, the Phase III NALA trial is a randomized controlled trial of neratinib plus capecitabine versus Tykerb® (lapatinib) plus capecitabine in patients with third-line HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The trial enrolled 621 patients who were randomized (1:1) to receive either neratinib plus capecitabine or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The trial was conducted globally at sites in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and South America. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are centrally confirmed progression free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. An alpha level of 1% was allocated to the PFS and 4% allocated to OS. 
 In December 2018 we announced that for the primary analysis of centrally confirmed PFS, treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a statistically significant improvement in centrally confirmed PFS (p=0.0059) compared to treatment with lapatinib plus capecitabine. For the primary analyses of OS, neratinib plus capecitabine resulted in a numerical improvement in OS that did not achieve statistical significance (p=0.21). For the secondary endpoint of time to intervention for symptomatic central nervous system disease (also referred to as brain metastases), the results of the trial showed that treatment with neratinib plus capecitabine led to an improvement over the combination of lapatinib plus capecitabine (p=0.043).
 The safety profile of neratinib in the Phase III NALA study was consistent with previous clinical trials of neratinib.
 Full results of the trial will be submitted to health authorities around the world, including the FDA and EMA. Results of the trial will be submitted for presentation at a major medical conference in 2019. 
 In 2010, Pfizer also initiated a Phase I/II trial of neratinib in combination with the anti-cancer drug temsirolimus, or Torisel, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have failed multiple prior treatments. The trial was conducted as a Phase I/II trial of PB272 given in combination with the anticancer drug temsirolimus in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The Phase I portion of the trial, which was reported previously, determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 240 mg of neratinib daily with 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly and the dose limiting toxicity was diarrhea. The interim Phase II data was presented at the 2014 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.  The Phase II portion of the study was conducted in two cohorts. The first cohort, referred to as the Maximum Tolerated Dose, or MTD, cohort, received 240 mg of neratinib daily with 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly. This cohort of patients received low dose loperamide (4 mg per day) prophylactically in order to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. The second cohort of patients, referred to as the dose escalation cohort, received 240 mg of neratinib daily and initially received 8 mg of temsirolimus weekly. This cohort of patients received high dose loperamide (16 mg per day initially) prophylactically in order to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. If patients in the dose escalation cohort had no tolerability issues with the combination of neratinib and temsirolimus given at 8 mg per week during the first cycle of treatment, patients in this dose escalation cohort were allowed to dose escalate the temsirolimus to 15 mg per week for the remainder of the study. Patients in both cohorts in the study received a median of 3 prior regimens in the metastatic setting (range 1-8 prior regimens) before entering the trial. The 37 patients in the MTD cohort were enrolled at 3 centers in the United States and the 45 patients in the dose escalation cohort were enrolled at 8 centers in the United States, Europe and Asia.  The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event for the patients who received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus was diarrhea. For the 37 patients in the MTD cohort, who received low dose loperamide prophylactically, 12 patients (32%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea. For the 41 patients in the dose escalation cohort, who received high dose loperamide prophylactically and were allowed to dose escalate the temsirolimus dose, 7 patients (17%) reported grade 3 diarrhea. 4 (57%) of the 7 patients in the dose escalation cohort who 
 10

experienced grade 3 diarrhea were not compliant with the high dose loperamide prophylaxis. There were 4 patients in the dose escalation cohort who did not yet have safety data reported and are therefore not included in the safety population. For the patients in the dose escalation cohort, thus far 47% of the patients have been able to dose escalate  temsirolimus from 8 mg per week to 15 mg per week.  The interim efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 37 patients in the MTD cohort, 11 patients (30%) experienced a partial response. The median duration of response for this cohort of patients was 3.0 months and the median progression-free survival was 4.8 months.  For the 37 evaluable patients in the dose escalation cohort, the efficacy results from the trial demonstrated that 11 patients (30%) experienced a partial response.
 Metastatic Breast Cancer with Brain Metastases
 Approximately one-third of the patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer develop metastases that spread to their brain. The current antibody-based treatments, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1, do not enter the brain and therefore are not believed to be effective in treating these patients. In a Phase II trial with lapatinib given as a single agent, lapatinib demonstrated a 6% objective response rate in the patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer whose disease spread to their brain. In January 2012, a Phase II trial of neratinib as a single agent and in combination with the anticancer drug capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has spread to their brain was initiated in conjunction with the Dana Farber Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium. In June 2014, at the ASCO 2014 Annual Meeting, results from the first cohort (n=40) who were administered neratinib monotherapy was presented. The efficacy results from the first cohort of the trial showed that for the 40 evaluable patients, three (7.5%) patients experienced a partial response, four (10%) patients experienced prolonged stable disease for greater than or equal to six months and 12 (30%) patients experienced stable disease for less than six months. The median PFS of the 40 evaluable patients was seen to be 1.9 months and the median overall survival was seen to be 8.7 months. 
 In June 2017, we presented additional data from this trial at the ASCO 2017 Annual Meeting.  The multicenter Phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have brain metasteses.  The trial enrolled three cohorts of patients. Patients in the second cohort (n=5) represent patients who had brain metastases which were amenable to surgery and who were administered neratinib monotherapy prior to and after surgical resection. The third cohort (target enrollment=60) enrolled two sub-groups of patients (prior lapatinib-treated and no prior lapatinib) with progressive brain metastases who were administered neratinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine. The oral presentation reflected only the patients in the third cohort of patients without prior lapatinib exposure (cohort 3A, n=37), who all had progressive brain metastases at the time of enrollment and who received the combination of capecitabine plus neratinib. Results from the second cohort and cohort 3B (prior lapatinib-treated) will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.
 In cohort 3A, 30% of the patients had received prior craniotomy, 65% of the patients had received prior whole brain radiotherapy, and 35% had received prior stereotactic radiosurgery to the brain. No patients had received prior treatment with lapatinib.
 The primary endpoint of the trial was CNS Objective Response Rate according to a composite criteria that included volumetric brain MRI measurements, steroid use, neurological signs and symptoms, and RECIST evaluation for non-CNS sites. The secondary endpoint of the trial was CNS response by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases, or RANO-BM, criteria. The efficacy results from the trial showed that 49% of patients experienced a CNS Objective Response by the composite criteria. The results also showed that the CNS response rate using the RANO-BM criteria was 24%. The median time to CNS progression was 5.5 months and the median overall survival was 13.5 months, though 49% of patients remain alive and survival data are immature.
 The results for cohort 3A showed that the most frequently observed severe adverse event for the 37 patients evaluable for safety was diarrhea. Patients received antidiarrheal prophylaxis consisting of high dose loperamide, given together with the combination of capecitabine plus neratinib for the first cycle of treatment in order to try to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. Among the 37 patients evaluable for safety, 32% of the patients had grade 3 diarrhea and 41% had grade 2 diarrhea. 
 In April 2018, we announced that NERLYNX (neratinib) has been included as a recommended treatment option in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology Central Nervous System Cancers for Breast Cancer patients with brain metastases. The NCCN designated NERLYNX in combination with capecitabine as a category 2A treatment option and NERLYNX in combination with paclitaxel as a category 2B treatment option. Use, as designated for breast cancer patients with brain metastases, is outside the FDA-approved indication for NERLYNX and considered investigational, and we do not market or promote NERLYNX for these uses.
 Safety Database. Our safety database includes over 3,000 patients who have been treated with neratinib. To date, the most significant grade 3 or higher adverse event associated with neratinib has been diarrhea, which occurs in approximately 30% of patients receiving the drug. Historically, once diarrhea occurred, patients were treated with loperamide and/or a reduction in the dose of neratinib. We have evaluated a prophylactic protocol pursuant to which a high dose of loperamide, approximately 16 mg, is given together with the initial dose of neratinib and then tapered down during the first cycle of treatment.  We plan to continue evaluating this protocol as the preliminary data has suggested that this prophylactic regimen significantly reduces the incidence of diarrhea with neratinib.

In February 2015, Puma initiated a Phase II open-label trial of neratinib monotherapy for one year in 120 patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer who have completed one year of adjuvant trastuzumab, or the CONTROL trial.  The CONTROL trial is an international, open-label, Phase II study investigating the use of loperamide prophylaxis with or without other agents in the reduction of neratinib-associated diarrhea that has a primary endpoint of the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea.  In the CONTROL trial, patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy received neratinib daily for a period of one year. The trial initially tested high dose loperamide prophylaxis given for the first 2 cycles (56 days) of treatment (12 mg on days 1-14, 8 mg on days 15-56 and as needed thereafter).  In the original protocol, 4 mg loperamide is self-administered with the first dose of neratinib, followed by 2 mg loperamide every 4 hours for the first 3 days, reducing to 2 mg loperamide every 6 to 8 hours through the first 2 cycles of therapy.  With Amendment 1 of the protocol, the loperamide dosing schedule was modified to simplify the regimen.  Following Amendment 1 of the protocol, 4 mg loperamide is self-administered with the first dose of neratinib, followed by 4 mg loperamide three times a day for 2 weeks, followed by 4 mg loperamide twice daily through the first 2 cycles of therapy.  After two cycles, patients do not take loperamide prophylactically but take it as needed throughout the remainder of the treatment duration if diarrhea occurs.
 In December 2017, interim results from the CONTROL trial were presented at the 2017 CTRC-AACR San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.  The CONTROL trial was then expanded to include two additional cohorts. One cohort received the combination of loperamide and budesonide and the other cohort received the combination of loperamide plus colestipol. Budesonide is a locally acting corticosteroid that the Company believes targets the inflammation identified in a preclinical model of neratinib-induced diarrhea and colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant that the Company believes targets potential bile acid malabsorption that could result from such inflammation.  
 The interim analysis of the trial presented in the poster included a total of 137 patients who received neratinib plus loperamide prophylaxis, 64 patients who received neratinib plus loperamide prophylaxis for 2 cycles and budesonide for 1 cycle, and 120 patients who received neratinib plus loperamide prophylaxis for 1 cycle and colestipol for 1 cycle.  The results of the trial showed that the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea for the 137 patients who received the loperamide prophylaxis was 30.7%. For the 137 patients who received the loperamide prophylaxis, the median number of grade 3 diarrhea episodes per patient was 1 and the median cumulative duration of grade 3 diarrhea was 3 days. For the 137 patients who received loperamide prophylaxis, 20.4% discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea.  For the 64 patients who received the combination of loperamide plus budesonide, the results of the trial showed that the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 26.6%. The median number of grade 3 diarrhea episodes per patient was 1 and the median cumulative duration of grade 3 diarrhea was 2 days. For the 64 patients who received loperamide plus budesonide prophylaxis, 10.9% discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea.
 For the 120 patients who received the combination of loperamide plus colestipol, the results of the trial showed that the incidence of grade 3 diarrhea was 10.8%. The median number of grade 3 diarrhea episodes per patient was 1 and the median cumulative duration of grade 3 diarrhea was 3 days. For the 120 patients who received loperamide plus colestipol prophylaxis, 1.7% discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea. Further information is provided in Table 1 below:

PB272 (neratinib, oral)—Other Potential Applications 
 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
 Approximately 2% to 4% of patients with NSCLC have a HER2 mutation in the kinase domain. This mutation is believed to narrow the ATP binding cleft, which results in increased tyrosine kinase activity. The mutation is also believed to result in increased PI3K activity and mTOR activation. Published data suggests that patients with HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer do not respond to platinum chemotherapy and do not respond to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. 
 In September 2014, we reported initial data from the ongoing, open label Phase II clinical trial of PB272 (neratinib) for the treatment of patients with NSCLC with HER2 mutations as a late-breaking oral presentation at the ESMO 2014 Congress. In the trial, patients with confirmed Stage IIIB or Stage IV NSCLC with documented somatic HER2 mutations were randomized to receive either oral neratinib monotherapy at a dose of 240 mg per day or the combination of oral neratinib (at a dose of 240 mg daily) with intravenous temsirolimus administered at a dose of 8 mg per week. In order to attempt to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea, high-dose loperamide prophylaxis (Imodium) was given to all patients in both arms of the study beginning on day 1 of neratinib dosing. The data presented in the oral presentation involved a total of 27 patients who completed the first stage of the trial; 13 of these patients received neratinib monotherapy and 14 of these patients received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus.  The results of the study showed that the combination of PB272 and temsirolimus had acceptable tolerability. Historically the most frequently seen adverse event associated with neratinib has been diarrhea. In the previous Phase I trial of neratinib plus temsirolimus (published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2014) the diarrhea with neratinib was seen to be dose dependent and its incidence increased with increasing neratinib dosage. In that Phase I trial, grade 3 or higher diarrhea was seen in approximately 30% of the patients treated with doses of neratinib that were 200 mg or higher. In the Phase II study, all patients received high-dose loperamide in order to attempt to prevent or reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. For the 13 patients enrolled in the neratinib monotherapy arm, 1 patient (8%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea, and for the 14 patients enrolled in the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus arm, 2 patients (14%) experienced grade 3 diarrhea. There were no grade 4 diarrhea events seen in the trial. For the 3 patients in the study (1 in the monotherapy arm, 2 in the combination arm) who experienced grade 3 diarrhea, 2 of the 3 patients were not compliant with the loperamide prophylaxis regimen and were not taking loperamide at the onset of grade 3 diarrhea.
 13

The efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 13 patients in the trial who received neratinib monotherapy, no patient experienced a partial response, 7 patients (54%) achieved stable disease and 4 patients (31%) achieved clinical benefit (defined as a partial response or stable disease for 12 or more weeks). For the 14 patients who received the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus, 3 patients (21%) experienced a partial response, 11 patients (79%) experienced stable disease and 9 patients (64%) achieved clinical benefit. The median PFS of the neratinib monotherapy arm was 2.9 months and the median PFS of the arm that received neratinib plus temsirolimus was 4.0 months. Patients continue to be enrolled in the arm of the trial that is receiving the combination of neratinib plus temsirolimus. 
 HER2 Mutation-Positive Solid Tumors 
 Based on the results from the Cancer Genome Atlas Study, we estimate that between 2% and 12% of each solid tumor has a mutation in HER2. In the United States, this includes new diagnoses of an estimated 7,000 – 7,500 patients with bladder cancer; 4,000 – 4,500 patients with colorectal cancer; 1,500 – 2,000 patients with glioblastoma; 1,000 patients with melanoma; 4,000 – 5,000 patients with prostate cancer; 1,000 patients with stomach cancer; and 1,000 – 2,000 patients with uterine cancer. 
 Basket Trial for HER2 Mutation-Positive Solid Tumors.  In October 2013, we announced that we had initiated a Phase II clinical trial of neratinib as a single agent in patients with solid tumors that have an activating HER2 mutation, which we refer to as the SUMMIT basket trial. The Phase II SUMMIT basket trial is an open-label, multicenter, multinational study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PB272 administered daily to patients who have solid tumors with activating HER2 or HER3 mutations. The study initially included six cohorts of patients, one for each of the following cancers: (i) bladder/urinary tract cancer; (ii) colorectal cancer; (iii) endometrial cancer; (iv) gastric/esophageal cancer; (v) ovarian cancer; and (vi) all other solid tumors (including prostate, melanoma and pancreatic cancer). Each cohort initially consists of seven patients. If a certain predetermined objective response rate is seen in the initial cohort of seven patients, the cohort will be expanded to include a larger number of patients. 
HER2-Mutated, Non-Amplified Breast Cancer
 A HER2 mutation in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer was identified as part of a study performed by the Cancer Genome Atlas Network and published in Cancer Discovery in December 2012. We believe this mutation may occur in an estimated 2% of patients with breast cancer. Pre-clinical data from this publication demonstrated that neratinib was active in pre-clinical models of HER2-negative breast cancer that have this HER2 mutation and that neratinib has more anti-cancer activity than either trastuzumab or lapatinib in cells with this mutation. A Phase II trial of neratinib in HER2-negative breast cancer patients who have a HER2 mutation opened for enrollment in December 2012.
 As stated above, in May 2014 we expanded the first cohort from the SUMMIT basket trial. Interim results from this ongoing Phase II trial were presented at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting.  All patients received loperamide (16 mg per day initially) prophylactically for the first cycle of treatment in order to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. Included in the presentation were data on 141 patients enrolled in the neratinib monotherapy arm of the trial, including 124 patients with HER2 mutations and 17 patients with HER3 mutations. This included patients with 21 unique tumor types, with the most common being breast, lung, bladder and colorectal cancer. There were also 30 distinct HER2 and 12 distinct HER3 mutations observed among these patients, with the most frequent HER2 variants involving S310, L755, A755_G776insYVMA and V777.
 In the HER2-mutant cohort, clinical responses were observed in tumors with S310, L755, V777, P780_Y781insGSP and A775_G776insYVMA mutations. When stratified by tumor type, responses were observed in patients with breast, cervical, biliary, salivary and non-small-cell lung cancers, which led to cohort expansions in these tumor types. No activity was observed in the HER3-mutant cohort. A more detailed presentation of the data is presented in the table below. 
 14

The neratinib safety profile observed in the SUMMIT study has been consistent with that observed previously in metastatic patients with HER2 amplified tumors. With anti-diarrheal prophylaxis and management, diarrhea has not been a treatment-limiting side effect in SUMMIT. The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event has been diarrhea. For the 141 patients enrolled in the neratinib monotherapy arm with safety data available as of March 10, 2017, 31 patients (22%) reported grade 3 diarrhea. The median duration of grade 3 diarrhea for those patients was two days. Four patients (2.8%) permanently discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and 21 patients (14.9%) temporarily discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea and then restarted after the diarrhea subsided.

In December 2018, we announced that updated results from the SUMMIT basket trial in the HER2-mutant, hormone receptor positive breast cancer cohort were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.  The results included data from 47 patients who received 240 mg of neratinib daily in combination with fulvestrant at the labeled dose. In this cohort, 43 patients (92%) had HER2-non-amplified disease, and patients had received a median of three prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting (range 0-11 prior regimens) before entering the trial. All patients had been previously treated with an endocrine agent prior to entering the study, including 25 patients (53%) who had received prior fulvestrant. Further, 20 patients (43%) received prior cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) -inhibitor therapy.
 The efficacy summary of the breast cohort that received neratinib + fulvestrant is shown in the table below. The interim efficacy results from the trial showed that for the 47 efficacy evaluable patients, 14 patients (30%) experienced an objective response, which included four patients with a complete response and 10 patients with partial responses, and 22 patients (47%) experienced clinical benefit (clinical benefit is defined as confirmed complete response or partial response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks). The median duration of response was 9.2 months and the median progression free survival was 5.4 months. Subgroup analysis showed that patients who had received prior fulvestrant or CDK4/6 inhibitor targeted therapy prior to entering the trial also benefited from treatment of neratinib and fulvestrant. Of note, six patients (30%) with prior CDK4/6-inhibitor exposure showed confirmed responses, with the duration of responses ranging from 4.5–14.8 months. Four patients were still on treatment at the time of data reporting.

 The safety profile observed in neratinib and fulvestrant-treated breast cancer patients in the SUMMIT basket trial was consistent with that observed previously in metastatic patients with HER2 amplified tumors. With anti-diarrheal prophylaxis and management, diarrhea was not a treatment-limiting side effect in the SUMMIT basket trial. The interim safety results of the study showed that the most frequently observed adverse event was diarrhea. For the 47 patients enrolled in the trial, 11 patients (23%) reported grade 3 diarrhea. The median duration of grade 3 diarrhea for those patients was 1.5 days. No patients permanently discontinued neratinib due to diarrhea.
 PB272 (neratinib, intravenous) 
 We also plan to develop neratinib as an intravenously administered agent. The intravenous version of neratinib resulted in higher exposure levels of neratinib in pre-clinical models. We believe this may result in higher blood levels of neratinib in patients, and may translate into enhanced efficacy. We are evaluating the intravenous formulation of neratinib and considering options relative to its development. 
 PB357 
 PB357 is an orally administered agent that is an irreversible TKI that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. PB357 is structurally similar to PB272. Pfizer completed single-dose Phase I trials of PB357. We are evaluating PB357 and considering options relative to its development.  
 Clinical Testing of Our Products in Development 
 Each of our products in development, and likely all future drug candidates we in-license, will require extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing to determine the safety and efficacy of the product applications prior to seeking and obtaining regulatory approval. This process is expensive and time consuming. In completing these trials, we are dependent upon third-party consultants, consisting mainly of investigators and collaborators, who will conduct such trials. 
 We and our third-party consultants conduct pre-clinical testing in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and clinical testing in accordance with Good Clinical Practice standards, or GCP, which are international ethical and scientific quality standards utilized for pre-clinical and clinical testing, respectively. GCP is the standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis and reporting of clinical trials and the FDA requires compliance with GCP regulations in the conduct of clinical trials. Additionally, our pre-clinical and clinical testing completed in the EU is conducted in accordance with applicable EU standards, such as the EU Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC of April 4, 2001), or the EU Clinical Trials Directive, and the national laws of the 28 member states of the EU, or Member States, implementing its provisions. 
 16

We have entered into, and may enter into in the future, master service agreements with clinical research organizations, or CROs, with respect to initiating, managing and conducting the clinical trials of our products. These contracts contain standard terms for the type of services provided that contain cancellation clauses requiring between 30 and 45 days written notice and that obligate us to pay for any services previously rendered with prepaid, unused funds being returned to us. 
 Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new products to treat cancer is highly competitive, and we face considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty cancer companies. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive research and substantial financial resources invested in the discovery and development of new cancer products. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Genentech, Novartis, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim, Takeda, Daiichi Sankyo and Seattle Genetics.  None of these companies are developing their drugs for the extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer that has been previously treated with a trastuzumab-containing regimen.  All of these competitors are developing their drugs for the treatment of early stage and/or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.  We are an early stage company with a limited history of operations, sales, marketing and commercial manufacturing. Many of our competitors have substantially more financial and technical resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have more experience than we have in pre-clinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization. We are also competing with academic institutions, governmental agencies and private organizations that are conducting research in the field of cancer. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense competition if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates. We expect that our products under development and in clinical trials will address major markets within the cancer sector. Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors’ products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete pre-clinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, reimbursement and patent position. 
 Sales and Marketing
 During 2017, in connection with FDA approval of NERLYNX, we hired a U.S. specialty sales force of approximately 85 sales specialists who are focused on promoting NERLYNX to oncologists. This sales force is supported by an experienced sales leadership team comprised of regional sales managers, and our experienced commercial team comprised of experienced professionals in marketing, access and reimbursement, managed markets, marketing research, commercial operations, and sales force planning and management. In addition, our commercial infrastructure includes capabilities in manufacturing, medical affairs, quality control, and compliance.
 We launched NERLYNX in the United States in July 2017, and our focus is to establish NERLYNX as the first choice for extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early stage HER2-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. 
 In other markets outside of the United States in which NERLYNX may be approved, if any, we may choose to commercialize NERLYNX independently or by establishing one or more strategic alliances such as the ones we have established for commercializing NERLYNX in the territories for each of our respective licensees.
 In November 2018, our board of directors formed a commercialization committee, consisting of Michael Miller, Jay Moyes and Frank Zavrl (and on which Alan H. Auerbach, our Chief Executive Officer and President, participates), to assist management in further accelerating our commercialization efforts in the United States. In particular, the committee is assessing our current commercial infrastructure and sales organization, assisting management in designing and implementing additional strategies focused on optimizing our commercial results and working with management to provide additional oversight into the commercial department.
 Intellectual Property and License Agreements 
 
We hold a worldwide exclusive license under our license agreement with Pfizer to eighteen granted U.S. patents and five pending U.S. patent applications, as well as foreign counterparts thereof, and other patent applications and patents claiming priority therefrom. 
 
In the United States, we have a license to an issued patent, which currently will expire in 2025, for the composition of matter of neratinib, our lead compound. We have a license to an issued U.S. patent covering a family of compounds including neratinib, as well as equivalent patents in the EU and Japan, that currently expire in 2019. We also have a license to an issued U.S. patent for the use of neratinib in the treatment of breast cancer, which currently expires in 2025, an issued patent for the use of neratinib in the extended adjuvant treatment of early stage HER2 positive breast cancer that has previously been treated with a trastuzumab containing regimen that expires in 2030, and two issued patents for the formulation of NERLYNX that expire in 2030. In jurisdictions which permit such, we will seek patent term extensions where possible for certain of our patents. We plan to pursue additional patents in and outside the United States covering additional therapeutic uses of neratinib from these existing applications. In addition, we will pursue patent protection for any new discoveries or inventions made in the course of our development of neratinib. 
 17


If we obtain marketing approval for neratinib or other drug candidates in the United States or in certain jurisdictions outside the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as five years of new chemical entity exclusivity and, as mentioned below, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act. In addition, eight to eleven years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially are available for new drugs in the European Union; up to five years of patent extension are potentially available in Europe (Supplemental Protection Certificate), and eight years of data exclusivity are potentially available in Japan. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity, or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See “Government Regulation” below. 
 
The intellectual property portfolio that was licensed from Pfizer in 2011 when we licensed neratinib included issued patents in a number of countries, including in Europe (EP1848414), as well as pending patent applications in several countries, including the United States, relating to methods of treating gefitinib-and/or erlotinib-resistant cancer by administering an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor.  More specifically, the patent that was issued in Europe in April 2011 included specific claims that included a pharmaceutical composition for use in treating cancer in a subject with a cancer having a mutation in epidermal growth factor receptor with a T790M mutation. On November 28, 2011, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH filed an opposition to this patent asking for this patent to be revoked. Oral proceedings were held before the Opposition Division of the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany on February 4, 2014. The decision of the Opposition Division was to uphold the granted claims of the European patent that relate to the T790M mutation without any modification. This included specific claims that include claims for the pharmaceutical composition comprising an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor for use in treating cancer in a subject having a T790M mutation, and claims for the pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of numerous cancers, including lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  Both parties have appealed this decision.  The appeal is pending.  
 
An Opposition was filed by Hexal AG, or Hexel, on August 3, 2016 against European Patent No. EP2416774 which was licensed from Pfizer in 2011, and which claims neratinib for use in a method for treating HER-2/neu overexpressed/amplified cancer and improving IDFS, wherein the method comprises delivering neratinib therapy to HER-2/neu overexpressed/amplified cancer patients following the completion of at least one year of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy, and wherein the neratinib therapy comprises treating the cancer patients with neratinib for at least twelve months.  An oral hearing was held December 8, 2017, wherein the patent was maintained as granted.  Hexal then appealed, which appeal is pending.
 
On October 4, 2017, Hexal AG also filed an Opposition to European Patent No. EP2326329 which was licensed from Pfizer in 2011, and which claims a combination of neratinib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof with capecitabine for use in a method of treating an Erb-2 positive metastatic breast cancer.  An oral hearing was held on February 13, 2019, wherein the patent was maintained as granted.  Hexal could appeal this ruling.
 
An Opposition was filed by Generics (UK) Ltd., or Generics, on September 3, 2015 against European Patent No. EP2656844, which was licensed from Pfizer in 2011, and which claims, inter alia, a pharmaceutical pack containing 50 to 300 mg of neratinib and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and vinorelbine for use in a method of treating a neoplasm.  An oral hearing was held July 3, 2017, wherein the patent was maintained as granted.  Generics then appealed, which appeal is pending.
 
Unipharm Ltd. filed a pre-grant opposition to Israeli Patent Application No. IL215166 on December 7, 2016.  This application was licensed from Pfizer in 2011.  The opposition was abandoned after Unipharm missed a deadline for filing evidence.  The patent subsequently granted on August 14, 2017 and claims use of neratinib in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of HER2/neu overexpressed/amplified cancer.
 
Unipharm also filed a pre-grant opposition to Israeli Patent Application No. IL210616 on January 31, 2016.  This application was licensed from Pfizer in 2011.  An oral hearing was held in Jerusalem before the Israeli Patent Office on January 22, 2018.  The matter is pending before the Israeli Patent Office.  The application is directed to use of a combination of neratinib and capecitabine in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neoplasm.
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always provide us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our intellectual property and potential products, and if we cannot obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property and potential products, we may not be able to successfully market our potential products.” 
 
18

We depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and inventions for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 
In-License Agreement 
 In August 2011, Former Puma entered into an agreement pursuant to which Pfizer agreed to grant to Former Puma a worldwide license for the development, manufacture and commercialization of neratinib (oral), neratinib (intravenous), PB357, and certain related compounds. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the license would not become effective until Former Puma closed a capital raising transaction in which it raised at least $25 million in aggregate net proceeds and had a net worth of at least $22.5 million. Upon the closing of the financing that preceded the Merger, this condition was satisfied. 
 We assumed the license agreement, in accordance with its terms, in the Merger. The license is exclusive with respect to certain patent rights owned or licensed by Pfizer. Under the license agreement, Pfizer is obligated to transfer to us certain information, records, regulatory filings, materials and inventory controlled by Pfizer and relating to or useful for developing these compounds and to continue to conduct certain ongoing clinical studies until a certain time. After that time, we are obligated to continue such studies pursuant to an approved development plan, including after the license agreement terminates for reasons unrelated to Pfizer’s breach of the license agreement, subject to certain specified exceptions. We are also obligated to commence a new clinical trial for a product containing one of these compounds within a specified period of time and use commercially reasonable efforts to complete such trial and achieve certain milestones as provided in a development plan. If certain of our out-of-pocket costs in completing such studies exceed a mutually agreed amount, Pfizer will pay for certain additional out-of-pocket costs to complete such studies. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products containing these compounds in specified major-market countries and other countries in which we believe it is commercially reasonable to develop and commercialize such products. 
 As consideration for the license, we are required to make payments totaling $187.5 million upon the achievement of certain milestones if all such milestones are achieved. In connection with the FDA approval of NERLYNX in July 2017, we triggered a one-time milestone payment.
 The license agreement originally stipulated that should we commercialize any of the compounds licensed from Pfizer or any products containing any of these compounds, we will be obligated to pay to Pfizer incremental annual royalties between approximately 10% and 20% of net sales of all such products, subject, in some circumstances, to certain reductions. 
 In July 2014, we signed an amendment to the license agreement with Pfizer. The amendment to the license agreement provides that we would be solely responsible for the expenses incurred or accrued in conducting the ongoing legacy clinical trials after December 31, 2013.  These costs were previously the responsibility of Pfizer.
 In addition, under the amended agreement, annual royalties to be paid on net sales of licensed products were reduced from a tiered royalty rate structure ranging between 10% to 20% to a fixed rate in the low to mid-teens.  
 Our royalty obligation continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering the applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the earlier of generic competition for such licensed product reaching a certain level of sales in such country or expiration of a certain time period after first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. We can terminate the license agreement at will at any time after April 4, 2013, or for safety concerns, in each case upon specified advance notice. Each party may terminate the license agreement if the other party fails to cure any breach of a material obligation by such other party within a specified time period. Pfizer may terminate the license agreement in the event of our bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or similar proceeding. The license agreement contains other customary clauses and terms as are common in similar agreements in the industry.

Government Regulation 
 United States—FDA Process 
 The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution. 
 Drug Approval Process. None of our drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following: 

• | completion of extensive pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin. 
 Clinical trials involve administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be provided to the FDA as part of a separate submission to the IND. Further, an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects for any clinical trial before it commences at that center, and the IRB must monitor the study until it is completed. There are also requirements governing reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical trials necessary for product approval typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into a limited population, typically healthy humans, to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. Phase III trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are undertaken in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers to further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form. There can be no assurance that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the FDA or an IRB may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Moreover, the FDA may approve an NDA for a product candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 
 22

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given an opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase II, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach an agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase II meeting to discuss their Phase II clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase III clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. A sponsor may request a special protocol assessment, or SPA to reach an agreement with the FDA that the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analyses are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to effectiveness in the indication studied. If such an agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the administrative record, and it will be binding on the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product after clinical studies begin, or if the sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval, even if the study is subject to an SPA. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final drugs. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of pre-clinical studies and of clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. An NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, which is waived for the first NDA submitted by a qualifying small business. 
 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The FDA will review the NDA and may deem it to be inadequate to support approval, and we cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to the appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or the facilities at which the drug and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing is in compliance with cGMPs. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or in some cases a Complete Response Letter. The approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional pivotal Phase III clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials is not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Alternatively, the FDA could also approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to mitigate risks of the drug, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. Once the FDA approves a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs or other information. 
 Expedited Review and Approval. The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Priority review is designed to give drugs for serious conditions that offer significant improvement in safety or effectiveness an initial review within six months of the 60-day filing date, if the drug is a new molecular entity, as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although fast track designation and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings 
 23

with a sponsor of a fast track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. The FDA may also initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete for drugs with fast track designation. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission of portions of the application. Drugs for serious conditions are also eligible for accelerated approval, which provides an earlier approval of drugs, including fast track products, upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome, or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials. Finally, breakthrough therapy designation, which was established by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, is for drugs intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies receive all the benefits of a fast track designation, as well as intensive guidance on efficient drug development and organizational commitment involving senior managers in the FDA. We may seek to utilize one or more of these expedited programs for our product candidates in the future, but even if we were to obtain fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and/or breakthrough therapy designation, there is no guarantee that it would result in a quicker review or approval of our products, if any. 
 Post-Approval Requirements. After a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. In addition, certain changes to an approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes, or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. 
 If post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to (i) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and maintain pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events; (ii) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products; and (iii) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMPs after approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the extension must be requested prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.  
 24

Data and market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct, or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials and approval of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of MAs: 
  
• | Community MAs – These are issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and are valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA; for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation; or for products that are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs – These are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member State through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State. The competent authority of the Reference Member State prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the Reference Member State, the product is subsequently granted a National MA in all the Member States, i.e., in the Reference Member State and the Member States Concerned.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 As in the United States, it may be possible in foreign countries to obtain a period of market and/or data exclusivity that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic product. For example, if any of our products receive marketing approval in the EEA, we expect they will benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity. An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), we obtain an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies. The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first marketing authorization in the EEA and prevents generics from relying on the marketing authorization holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data for a period of eight years. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the marketing authorization holder’s data. However, a generic cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product), or three years 
 25

later (or a total of 11 years after the first marketing authorization in the EU of the innovator product) if the marketing authorization holder obtains marketing authorization for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. In Japan, our products may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for such regulatory exclusivity, or that such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. 
 When conducting clinical trials in the EU, we must adhere to the provisions of the European Union Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC) and the laws and regulations of the EU Member States implementing them. These provisions require, among other things, that the prior authorization of an Ethics Committee and the competent Member State authority is obtained before commencing the clinical trial. In April 2014, the EU passed the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation 536/2014), which will replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. To ensure that the rules for clinical trials are identical throughout the European Union, the EU Clinical Trials Regulation was passed as a regulation that is directly applicable in all EU member states. All clinical trials performed in the European Union are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive until the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. According to the current plans of the EMA, the Clinical Trials Regulation is expected to become applicable in 2019. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and internationally, sales of NERLYNX and any other products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. We may need to conduct pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products for formulary coverage and reimbursement. Even with such studies, our products may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than existing products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, in whole or in part. 
 In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted to potentially impact reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market. 
 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our future business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, enacted in March 2010, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, ACA establishes: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, or the donut hole; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the current presidential administration and U.S. Congress will likely continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry health insurance.  On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.
 26

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the 21st Century Cures Act changes the reimbursement methodology for infusion drugs and biologics furnished through durable medical equipment in an attempt to remedy over- and underpayment of certain drugs.
 Similar political, economic and regulatory developments are occurring in the EU and may affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to profitably commercialize their products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most EU member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing EU and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the ability of pharmaceutical companies to commercialize their products. In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies.
 In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system and international healthcare systems. Future legislation, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. The adoption of certain proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, and limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Therefore, substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products by third-party payors. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction prior to and after approval, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA, which may require us to collect additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patient. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. 
 Outside the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country.

Manufacturing
We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to continue to use our financial resources to accelerate commercialization of NERLYNX and development of our drug candidates rather than diverting resources to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. While our drug candidates were being developed by Pfizer, both the drug substance and drug product were manufactured by third-party contractors. We are currently using the same third-party contractors to manufacture, supply, store and distribute our products in clinical trials and commercial quantities.  We believe that we have manufactured sufficient quantities of the drug to support at least the first year of launch in the extended adjuvant breast cancer indication and plan to continue to manufacture the drug in 2019 to further support the commercial launch of the drug.  
 Should any of our other drug candidates obtain marketing approval, we anticipate establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers in connection with commercial production of our products. We have some flexibility in securing other manufacturers to produce our drug candidates; however, our alternatives may be limited due to proprietary technologies or methods used in the manufacture of some of our drug candidates. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 We may also be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws and transparency laws.  Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. In addition, some state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under any of these laws. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also may be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing. Given the penalties that may be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or determine that we or our executive officers had violated these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. 
 Privacy and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe and in many other jurisdictions where we may in the future conduct our operations. As we receive, collect, process, use and store personal and confidential data, we are subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including, in the United States, HIPAA, and, in the European Union, GDPR. Compliance with these privacy and data security requirements is rigorous and time-intensive and may increase the cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 28

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 In addition, the regulatory framework for the receipt, collection, processing, use, safeguarding, sharing and transfer of personal and confidential data is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future as new global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. For example, on May 25, 2018, the GDPR took effect in Europe. The GDPR is directly applicable in each EU member state and applies to companies established in the EU as well as companies that collect and use personal data to offer goods or services to, or monitor the behavior of, individuals in the EU. GDPR introduces more stringent data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, and penalties and fines for failure to comply with GDPR are significant, including fines of up to €20 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher. Further, there are federal transparency requirements and an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to disclose and make reports to the government of pricing and marketing information as well as any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians, teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our future reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the applicable state and/or federal authorities. 
 Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above due to the breadth of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. The costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed or negative public perceptions resulting therefrom, could require us to restructure our operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
 Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in the EU and other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct often are strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our drug candidates, if approved, any inappropriate activity by international distribution partners could have adverse implications for us.
 Other Laws and Regulatory Processes 
 We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States with securities traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses. 
 Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export, and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot accurately be predicted. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development activities, which include personnel costs, research supplies, clinical and pre-clinical study costs, are the primary source of our overall expenses. Such expenses related to the research and development of our product candidates totaled $164.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, $207.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $222.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 272 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. During 2017, in preparation for the commercial launch of NERLYNX, we hired 125 full-time employees for sales, marketing and commercial related activities. We believe our relations with our employees are good. Over the course of the next year, we anticipate hiring approximately 44 additional full-time employees, most of whom will be devoted to commercial activities.
 In addition, we intend to continue to use CROs and third parties to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing.

 The reference to www.pumabiotechnology.com (including any other reference to such address in this Annual Report) is an inactive textual reference only, meaning that the information contained on or accessible from the website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated in this report by reference. 
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2007 under the name Innovative Acquisitions Corp. We were a “shell” company registered under the Exchange Act with no specific business plan or purpose until we acquired Former Puma in the Merger. As a result of this transaction, Former Puma become our wholly-owned subsidiary and subsequently merged with and into us, at which time we adopted Former Puma’s business plan and changed our name to “Puma Biotechnology, Inc.” 
 The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition whereby Former Puma was deemed to be the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes and we were deemed to be the acquired party. Consequently, our financial statements prior to the Merger reflect the assets and liabilities and the historical operations of Former Puma from its inception on September 15, 2010, through the closing of the Merger on October 4, 2011. Our financial statements after completion of the Merger include the assets and liabilities of us and Former Puma, the historical operations of Former Puma, and the operations of us following the closing date of the Merger. 
 The merger of a private operating company into a non-operating public shell corporation with nominal net assets is considered to be a capital transaction, in substance, rather than a business combination, for accounting purposes. Accordingly, we treated this transaction as a capital transaction without recording goodwill or adjusting any of our other assets or liabilities. 
 In November 2012, we established and incorporated Puma Biotechnology Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary, for the sole purpose of serving as our legal representative in the United Kingdom and the European Union in connection with our clinical trial activity in those countries.
