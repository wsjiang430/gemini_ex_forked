Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of novel immunotherapeutics and vaccines for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity. We aim to treat and prevent infectious diseases and cancer by using our proprietary platforms to develop product candidates that stimulate powerful, targeted immune responses against pathogens, infected cells, and tumor cells. We design these product candidates to stimulate immune responses that are robust, highly specific, and are differentiated by the magnitude of the T cell populations induced, which exhibit critical functionality and durability. In the field of autoimmunity, we use our proprietary platform to develop product candidates that are designed to induce regulatory T cells to suppress specifically pathogenic autoimmune responses and prevent/reverse autoimmunity. We are focused on applying our platform capabilities and the expertise of our team to address significant unmet medical needs in two settings—the therapeutic setting, for the treatment of chronic infectious diseases, cancer, and autoimmunity; and the prophylactic setting, for the prevention of infectious diseases, based on our platform’s ability to respond rapidly to epidemic and pandemic threats.
We have a broad pipeline of both clinical and preclinical stage therapeutic and prophylactic programs. Our current therapeutic programs include VTP-300 for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection, or CHB, VTP-200 for the treatment of human papilloma virus infection, or HPV, VTP-850 for the treatment of prostate cancer, VTP-600 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, VTP-1000 for treatment of celiac disease, and VTP-1100 for treatment of HPV-associated cancers. The latter two programs are designed to utilize our SNAPvaxTM platform. Our current prophylactic programs include VTP-400 for the prevention of herpes zoster, or shingles, and VTP-500 for the prevention of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. In addition, we co-invented a COVID-19 vaccine with the University of Oxford, the rights to which we assigned to Oxford University Innovation, or OUI, to facilitate the license of those rights by OUI to AstraZeneca UK Limited, or AstraZeneca. The vaccine, formerly referred to as AZD1222, is now authorized for use under the marketing name Vaxzevria in a number of countries. AstraZeneca has exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Vaxzevria.
Scientists have successfully harnessed the immune system to prevent and treat diseases using a wide range of approaches over hundreds of years. In the prophylactic setting, vaccines aim to create long-lasting protective immunity, while in the therapeutic setting, immunotherapeutics aim to balance the body’s immune response either by strengthening it to enable clearance of pathogens and infected or cancerous cells, or by dampening it to limit inflammation and tissue damage due to autoimmune hyperactivity. A key element of the immune system is specialized white blood cells, or lymphocytes. B cells and T cells are the two main types of lymphocytes. B cells are responsible for generating antibodies while T cells assist in the clearance of acute and chronic infections, such as hepatitis B virus and HPV, and are involved in killing cells that become cancerous. Although designed to be protective, these immune cells can also be hyperactive and, when targeted against self, they are responsible for tissue-specific damage in many autoimmune conditions.
Over the past three decades, hundreds of trials have examined a wide variety of approaches that induce the production of cytotoxic, or CD8+, T cells against infected and cancerous cells. These trials have demonstrated that different approaches induce different breadths and magnitudes of immune response. While there have been many successes, certain diseases requiring a robust CD8+ T cell response have remained resistant to existing approaches. Infected or cancerous cells are recognized through specific molecules, or antigens, which induce an immune response in the human body. Our platforms are designed to stimulate the production of very high levels of T cells, in addition to antibodies, against such antigens. Our approach for the treatment or prevention of a disease with a known target antigen is to prime the immune system with an initial injection of a proprietary platform encoded with the target antigen. In the therapeutic setting, this is typically followed by a boost with a second, different, platform encoded with the same antigen. This is known as a heterologous prime-boost, or a mix and match approach. We employ unique antigen design strategies to optimize immune presentation and maximize the desired type of antibody and/or T cell immunogenicity that we are seeking to induce. This heterologous prime-boost approach has been shown to provide the highest magnitude and durable immunogenic CD8+ T cell response induced in humans to date. Our platforms are further differentiated by their flexibility, applicability across diseases in both the therapeutic and prophylactic setting, favorable tolerability profile and proven rapid production on a large scale.

Autoimmunity develops when the tolerance checkpoints meant to maintain a state of unresponsiveness of our immune system towards self-antigens are lost. It results in abnormal immune reaction against our own tissues, causing tissue damage and disease. Although the past two decades have seen incredible progress in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, current therapies still rely heavily on the use of non-specific immunosuppressive agents and supportive therapies. These may efficiently dampen inflammation and compensate organ dysfunction to some degree, but they require lifelong treatment and their lack of specificity for the pathogenic mechanism only can lead to several, sometimes life-threatening, side effects. A far less aggressive approach is to restore immune tolerance to self-antigens, in an antigen-specific manner, enabling to selectively blunt autoinflammation and control the disease without impairing protective immunity to pathogens and cancer. Our SNAPvax tolerizing platform is comprised of several self-antigens involved in the disease associated with a tolerizing immunomodulator. It is specifically designed to induce self-antigen-specific regulatory T cells, whose main function is to control immune responses by means of direct cell-cell contact, release of soluble factors, or indirectly via antigen-presenting cells, thereby controlling hyperactive autoreactive pathogenic T cells specifically.
In 2022, we achieved a number of strategic, operational, and financial objectives, which we believe positions us to deliver on our long-term plans:

Our Platforms
Our proprietary platforms comprise several components that either 1) when combined, allow us to develop product candidates designed to induce high and durable levels of antigen-specific T cells and B cells to prevent and treat infectious diseases and cancer, or 2) induce regulatory T cells and/or decrease T cell activation to specifically control autoreactive immune cell hyperactivity. 
The key elements of our first platform include our proprietary modified simian adenoviral vectors, known as ChAdOx1 and ChAdOx2, as well as the well-validated Modified Vaccinia Ankara, or MVA, boost vector, both with demonstrable tolerability profiles and an inability to replicate in humans. We believe both ChAdOx1 and MVA have favorable tolerability profiles, based on extensive clinical testing performed by us and others. MVA has also been administered in commercial use and in multiple clinical trials to over 130,000 people without significant safety issues, including 120,000 of whom received it as a next-generation smallpox vaccine in Germany. The combination of a ChAdOx prime with MVA boost has consistently generated significantly higher magnitudes of CD8+ T cells as compared to other technologies and approaches. We have also developed proprietary enhancements for both our ChAdOx and MVA vectors to increase T cell induction and response, and we employ unique antigen design strategies to optimize in vivo immune presentation and maximize the desired type of immunogenicity while maintaining an optimal tolerability profile. In addition, our understanding and expertise in manufacturing optimization has allowed us to manipulate adenovirus genomes to enable rapid generation of recombinant adenoviral vectors at Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, standards at exceptional speed and significant scale.
With the acquisition of Avidea Technologies, Inc. or Avidea, in December 2021, we have added SNAPvax to our proprietary platforms. SNAPvax is a modular immunotherapy platform that is designed to leverage self-assembling nanoparticles containing multiple targeted peptide antigens and immunomodulators to key immune cell populations for promoting T cell immunity. A recent article in Nature Biotechnology described SNAPvax as among the most effective immunotherapy platforms for inducing T cell immunity reported to date. Another article in Nature Biotechnology reported that SNAPvax enables repeated intravenous, or IV, administration to maximize efficacy.

Within oncology, we are advancing assets based on the SNAPvax cancer immunotherapy platform, or SNAPvax CI, co-delivering tumor antigens and an immunostimulant (TLR7/8a) for use in heterologous prime-boost regimens for treating advanced cancers. SNAPvax CI is designed to provide a unique advantage as compared to other cancer immunotherapy candidates as it can be repeatedly administered to engage every stage of the cancer immunity cycle (T cell priming and expansion; tumor inflammation; T cell recruitment; and T cell licensing) to potentially maximize therapeutic benefit. 
Outside oncology, we are advancing assets based on the SNAPvax tolerizing immunotherapy platform, or SNAPvax TI, to treat autoimmune diseases with known autoantigens. SNAPvax TI contains autoantigens and immunomodulators (e.g., mTOR inhibitors) to specifically induce regulatory T cells, crucial to maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. Its unique design allows for trafficking to lymphoid organs and local tissues, where Treg induction occurs and their activity is required to maximize therapeutic benefit.
We have several therapeutic programs in our pipeline focusing on infectious diseases, oncology and immune tolerance.
Our Pipeline
The chart below provides key information about our programs.

VTP-300: An Immunotherapeutic Targeting Chronic HBV Infection
In May 2022, we completed the last patient visit in our HBV001 Phase 1 clinical trial in the United Kingdom. Two types of participants were enrolled: healthy participants and participants with CHB whose infection has been suppressed with oral antiviral therapies. The primary objective of the HBV001 trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of a single vaccination of ChAdOx1-HBV. In addition, the secondary objectives are to determine the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-HBV and to determine the effect of ChAdOx1-HBV on the level of HBsAg in the participants with chronic HBV infection. All cohorts of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic HBV infection have completed treatment and follow up. No serious adverse events have been reported as of the date of this report.
We have used genotype C HBV antigen sequences in our VTP-300 vectors to target the most prevalent CHB genotype. However, we believe VTP-300 may induce cross-reactive T cell responses with other prevalent genotypes. Therefore, we also aim to determine if the T cell responses induced by the ChAdOx1-HBV viral vector used in this trial can potentially cross-react with other common HBV genotypes. The criteria for CHB patients to be enrolled in this trial were (i) infection that has been suppressed with oral antiviral medication (HBV DNA < 40 copies/mL) and (ii) relatively low levels of cccDNA markers (HBsAg < 10,000 IU/ml). As higher levels of CD8+ T cell induction are likely to occur in healthy controls, these samples are utilized to map the responses induced by VTP-300, to assess cross-reactivity with peptides, representing consensus sequences from genotypes B and D, which are more common in both the United States and Europe.

In addition, we are conducting a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, HBV002, to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of VTP-300 with or without a low-dose (0.3 m/kg) anti-PD-1 in CHB patients whose infection has been suppressed with oral antiviral medication. HBV002 enrollment was completed in May 2022.
In the HBV002 trial, we enrolled CHB patients in four treatment groups. The primary objective of this trial is to determine the safety and reactogenicity of the following in participants with chronic HBV infection and virally suppressed with oral antiviral medication: 1. MVA-HBV (prime-boost); 2. ChAdOx1-HBV and MVA-HBV (prime-boost); 3 and 4 ChAdOx1-HBV and MVA-HBV and nivolumab (prime-boost + anti-PD-1). The secondary objectives are to evaluate immunogenicity, PD-1 blockade timing, and the effect on the levels of hepatitis B markers, including HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody seroconversion, hepatitis B DNA, HBeAg, in CHB patients. The majority of the patients were recruited in Taiwan and South Korea and these territories were selected due to the high prevalence of HBV genotype C virus in Asia. Patients were also enrolled in the United Kingdom.
Since the participants are already infected with HBV, we thought it was possible that natural priming could eliminate the need for the prime-boost regimen. Hence, Group 1 of the HBV002 trial was designed to compare MVA-HBV given twice with the ChAdOx1-HBV plus MVA-HBV heterologous approach used in Group 2. We expected that the regimen given to Group 2 would be more immunogenic and planned to further explore this prime/boost regimen in Groups 3 and 4. The dosing regimen was ChAdOx1-HBV (day 0) and MVA-HBV and low-dose nivolumab (day 28) for Group 3 and ChAdOx1-HBV and low-dose nivolumab (day 0) and MVA-HBV and low-dose nivolumab (day 28) for Group 4.
In the cancer field, the use of an anti-PD-1 prior to vaccination has been reported to result in diminished T cell responses as compared to later administration. Whether the anti-PD-1 can be given simultaneously with the priming dose, or should follow it, is yet to be determined. Thus, in this protocol, we evaluated both regimens. Group 3 employed the low dose nivolumab given only at the boost, whereas Group 4 administered the nivolumab at both the prime and the boost dose. Nivolumab has been used in earlier immunotherapy trials at 1/10 the licensed dose for oncology indications and has been shown to give full peripheral blood T cell receptor occupancy for up to over one month.
An interim analysis of HBV002 was conducted in November 2021, after which the protocol was amended to stop enrollment in two cohorts: those receiving MVA prime and boost, Group 1, and those receiving VTP-300 with low dose nivolumab administered with both the ChAdOx1 prime and the MVA booster dose, Group 4. Enrollment continued in the cohort receiving VTP-300 as a monotherapy and the cohort receiving VTP-300 with a single low dose of nivolumab administered with the MVA booster dose.
We believe that the interim analysis from the HBV002 Phase 1b/2a suggests that VTP-300 could become part of a regimen that can attain a functional cure. In October 2022, we dosed our first patient in HBV003, a Phase 2b clinical trial to explore the optimal regimen. Although VTP-300 encodes genotype C antigens, many of these peptides are also expressed by other HBV genotypes. Our data indicate that VTP-300 is capable of inducing responses to non-genotype C HBVs, so we will aim to demonstrate activity against non-genotype C infected patients. We will also plan to evaluate additional combination regimens, such as next-generation modalities including RNA interference molecules, and may evaluate further potential collaboration partnerships. We may also evaluate VTP-300 in a trial in mainland China.

EASL and AASLD Poster Update to Interim Analysis of Safety and Efficacy Data from HBV002 Study
On June 22, 2022, we announced an update to the interim analysis of safety and efficacy data from the HBV002 study (NCT04778904), which was presented as a poster at the 2022 EASL International Liver CongressTM. The updated analysis, which included 39 patients with three-months of follow up, showed that VTP-300 as a monotherapy or in combination with low-dose nivolumab was administered with no treatment-related serious adverse events and that two patients experienced mild, rapidly resolving transaminitis. Meaningful and durable reductions of HBsAg were seen in some patients who received VTP-300 as either a monotherapy or in combination with a single low dose of nivolumab at the time of booster dose. Declines were most prominent in patients with lower baseline HBsAg at the time of enrollment. In all patients who had a HBsAg decline greater than 0.5 log10, the reductions of HBsAg were durable until the last measurement (up to eight months after the last dose). A robust T cell response against all encoded antigens, measured by overnight stimulation, was observed following VTP-300 administration, notable for marked CD8+ T cell predominance. Enrollment in the HBV002 study is complete with 55 patients enrolled. 
On November 7, 2022, we announced an update to the interim analysis of safety and efficacy data from the HBV002 study (NCT04778904), which was presented as a poster at the 2022 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) - The Liver Meeting® by Dr. Young-Suk Lim, Professor of the Department of Gastroenterology and the Liver Center, Asian Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Korea. The updated analysis, which included 55 patients with three months of follow up, showed that VTP-300 induced meaningful, sustained reductions of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in people with chronic HBV. Declines were most prominent in patients with lower baseline HBsAg. HBsAg is a hallmark of chronic HBV infection. Fewer than 10% of patients on current standard-of-care HBV therapies achieve sustained HBsAg decrease or loss, a state associated with functional cure of the disease. Group 3 (N=18) patients received VTP-300 in combination with a single low dose of nivolumab at the time of the booster dose, and the mean log10 reduction in HBsAg was 0.8 (n=18) at 3 months, 0.9 (n=10) at 6 months, and 1.3 (n=7) at 9 months, with more prominent declines observed in patients with baseline HBsAg lower than 1,000 IU/mL. Five patients in this group had baseline HBsAg lower than 100 IU/mL, of which four had declines over 0.6 log10. Moreover, two of those patients developed non-detectable HBsAg at 3 months, and one of the patients, who has been evaluated at 6 and 9 months, continued to maintain non-detectable HBsAg.
Future Development
In October 2022, the Company dosed the first patient in HBV003, a Phase 2b clinical trial of VTP-300 (NCT05343481) to explore the impact of different regimens of low dose Nivolumab and additional doses of the MVA boost component of VTP-300. In addition, a trial that uses a lead-in of the Arbutus siRNA AB-729, followed by a blinded randomization to either placebo or VTP-300, is now underway under Arbutus sponsorship with a planned enrollment of 20 patients per arm (placebo vs VTP-300 after the 6 month siRNA lead-in). The trial also plans a prospective, well-defined, nucleotide discontinuation protocol for those patients who reach substantial reduction in the level of hepatitis B surface antigen. We expect to announce interim efficacy data from both the HBV003 study and the combination study with siRNA from Arbutus in the fourth quarter of 2023.
VTP-200: Developing a Potential Non-Invasive Treatment for Persistent High-Risk HPV
We are developing VTP-200 as a potential curative treatment for persistent high-risk HPV infection and associated pre-cancerous lesions. An estimated 291 million women worldwide are carriers of HPV DNA, which can progress to pre-cancerous cervical lesions if untreated. Enrollment in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of VTP-200, HPV001 (NCT04607850), was completed in December 2022.
Preclinical Studies
Extensive preclinical studies were conducted using VTP-200, with resulting data showing that:

● | VTP-200 was well tolerated in preclinical toxicology studies; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | VTP-200 was highly immunogenic in inbred and outbred mice.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Toxicology Studies
In a GLP-compliant toxicology study, outbred mice were dosed with ChAdOx1-HPV and MVA-HPV at dose levels approximating the maximum anticipated clinical dose. Dosing resulted in an immune response, but with no significant toxicology findings.

13



Immunogenicity Studies
In preclinical immunogenicity studies, the HPV antigen was delivered by plasmid DNA, ChAdOx1 and MVA vectors in prime-boost regimens to inbred and outbred mice. ChAdOx1-HPV prime followed by MVA-HPV boost was shown to induce higher magnitude and more durable HPV-specific T cell responses than other regimens, as shown in the figure below. VTP-200-induced T cells were polyfunctional and persisted at high frequencies for at least six weeks.
In the preclinical immunogenicity studies, HPV-specific effector CD8+ T cells were detected in the cervix following systemic administration of ChAdOx1-HPV prime and followed by MVA-HPV boost. Finally, T cells specific for the HPV-encoded antigens were detected in women with current or past hrHPV infections, confirming the presence of immunogens relevant to natural immune control.
The MVA vector assessed in initial studies contains the HPV antigen at the thymidine kinase locus under the control of the p7.5 promoter. However, a more immunogenic MVA vector, which contains the HPV antigen under the control of the endogenous F11 promoter, was constructed. We determined that the T cell immunogenicity of the more immunogenic MVA promoter was superior to the MVA vector assessed in the initial preclinical studies and decided to use the next-generation vector in our clinical trials.
Clinical Development
Our HPV001 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of VTP-200 was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of VTP-200 and determine the optimal immunotherapeutic dose regimen. We enrolled a total of 108 healthy women with low grade lesions who had persistent high-risk HPV, or hrHPV, for at least six months. Patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or HSIL, or early cancer were excluded. The trial was run in the United Kingdom and the European Union. We recently announced the topline initial interim immunogenicity and safety data of 58 patients in the main phase of the trial that reached their six-month evaluation timepoint. We expect to announce full data from this trial in the first quarter of 2024. The diagram below provides an overview of the Phase 1b/2 clinical trial design.

The HPV001 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial was designed to identify an efficacious dose based on a joint response index of CD8+ T cell magnitude, CD4+T cell magnitude and CD4+ T cell avidity. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1-HPV plus MVA-HPV when administered in a prime-boost regimen. The secondary objectives of the trial were to determine the optimal dose and to evaluate the efficacy of HPV001 on the clearance of hrHPV infection and on the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN.
Future Development
Following the HPV001 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, if successful, we intend to initiate further clinical trials of VTP-200. Our next trials would potentially be a Phase 2/3 trial in healthy women with early grade CIN (squamous intraepithelial lesions, or LSIL) and additional trials in patients with more advanced CIN, vulval intraepithelial neoplasia, or VIN, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia, or AIN. 
We are also in the early stages of collaborating on an NIH-funded trial that would be conducted by the University of California San Francisco in more advanced CIN and AIN in human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, positive patients, to be recruited in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
VTP-850: Our Next-Generation Immunotherapeutic Candidate for Prostate Cancer
We are developing VTP-850, our next-generation prostate cancer product candidate, to improve upon VTP-800. Both VTP-800 and VTP-850 are composed of a heterologous prime-boost regimen with ChAdOx1 prime and MVA boost; however, VTP-800 encodes only one antigen, 5T4, while VTP-850 encodes four antigens, PSA, PAP, STEAP1 and 5T4. We designed VTP-850 to induce a broader immune response by encoding multiple antigens to reduce the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune response by mutating or losing expression of any one antigen. The antigens we encode in VTP-850 are expressed in most prostate cancers but have little or no expression on healthy tissues other than prostate.
Clinical Development
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of VTP-800 were sponsored and conducted by the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. VANCE was a first-in-human, open-label, randomized, Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost ChAdOx1-MVA administration as compared with homologous prime-boost with MVA alone, with and without low dose cyclophosphamide in localized prostate cancer. Thirty-nine patients with early stage localized, castration-sensitive prostate cancer were treated. Thirty-three patients received heterologous prime-boost with ChAdOx1-5T4 and MVA-5T4, while six patients received homologous prime-boost with MVA-5T4 alone. Patients received both regimens alone or with cyclophosphamide preconditioning. VTP-800 was generally well tolerated, with side effects of local injection site pain, fatigue, feverishness, and myalgia, which are consistent with those observed for these vectors in other clinical trials. There were no reported treatment-related serious adverse events.
It was also observed that 59% of participants had no detectable T cell response at baseline and developed a new 5T4-specific T cell response, as measured by an ex vivo gamma interferon ELISpot. Two patients had a baseline response, and the frequency of 5T4-specific T cells was increased following administration. The mean peak response of the 5T4-specific T cells in the responders was 198 cells per one million PBMCs, which is notable given that the 5T4 is a self-antigen. T cell infiltration into the resected prostate was also observed.
The figure below shows the 5T4-specific T cell responses to VTP-800 in the responding patients. The peak response, expressed as the number of 5T4-specific T cells secreting IFN-γ per one million PBMCs, in each patient who mounted a 5T4-specific T cell response following administration was compared to the 5T4 response detected prior to the first dose. The bars represent medians.

T Cell Response in Patients
ADVANCE was an open-label, non-randomized Phase 2 clinical trial of VTP-800 in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in 23 patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The primary objectives of the ADVANCE trial were to assess the safety and response rate of VTP-800 when administered in combination with nivolumab. The secondary objectives were to assess the immune responses in peripheral blood and to evaluate radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Patients received ChAdOx1-5T4 prime and MVA-5T4 boost one month later. Nivolumab was administered at months one, two and three. In most patients, VTP-800 was also given at months three and four. All patients received 2.5 x 10˄10 vp of ChAdOx1-5T4, 2.0 x 10˄10 pfu of MVA-5T4 and 480mg of nivolumab.
VTP-800 was generally well tolerated. The most common treatment emergent adverse events were bone pain, injection site pain, muscle pain, stomatitis, and constipation, and most were mild and grade 1 or 2. The only grade 3 adverse event was a chest infection, which was not related to study drug. There were no grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events. Three of eight patients with measurable disease had partial tumor responses. Five of 23, or 22%, of patients had greater than 50% reduction of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, at any timepoint, as shown in the figure below.

Future Development
The FDA accepted our IND for VTP-850 to be evaluated in PCA001, a Phase 1/2 open-label clinical trial in patients with rising PSA after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer, commencing in the first quarter of 2023. We plan to conduct the trial in several countries, including the United States. The trial will involve a Phase 1 dose finding stage with boost dose administered either intramuscularly or intravenously to determine the Phase 2 recommended dose and route of administration, followed by a two-stage expansion phase to evaluate immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of VTP-850.
VTP-1100: Our first product utilizing SNAPvax CI platform for HPV16+ cancers
VTP-1100 is our first product candidate leveraging the SNAPvax platform technology – brought into Vaccitech following the acquisition of Avidea in December 2021 – that will enter clinical testing.
VTP-1100 differs from VTP-200 in composition and patient population targeted: VTP-1100 will use a configuration of SNAPvax that is designed to elicit antigen-specific CD8+ T cells against HPV16+ cancers, either when administered alone or when used in a potent heterologous prime-boost regimen with the established ChAdOx1 platform. Preclinical studies in mice have shown that the SNAPvax-ChAdOx prime-boost induced superior T cell responses as compared with single or dual agent therapies (see figure below).

Status and Future Development
VTP-1100 is currently in the preclinical stage with GMP manufacturing and pivotal IND-enabling studies underway. We received pre-IND feedback from the FDA in July 2022, and based on the agency’s feedback expect to file an IND in the second half of 2023.
VTP-1000: Antigen-specific tolerizing immunotherapy candidate for celiac disease
Patients with celiac disease have an unwanted immune response against gluten proteins and can become severely ill following exposure to gluten found in various cereal grains, especially wheat.
VTP-1000 is a tolerizing immunotherapy that is designed to induce antigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) that promote tolerance and suppress the unwanted immune response to gluten.
VTP-1000 is the second product candidate based on the SNAPvax platform, designed to leverage its plug-and-play modularity to induce an entirely different type of T cell compared to the configuration utilized in VTP-1100. VTP-1000 comprises multiple gluten antigens (representing the key epitopes linked to celiac disease) and an immunomodulator co-delivered in nanoparticles of precise size and composition that are optimized to target immune cells that prime and expand Tregs. While the SNAPvax tolerizing immunotherapy is based on the same platform technology as the SNAPvax cancer immunotherapy enabling VTP-1100, an important distinction is that the tolerance immunotherapy includes an immunosuppressive immunomodulator that drives Treg expansion and prevents proinflammatory responses.
Status and Future Development
VTP-1000 is currently in preclinical development. Preclinical lead optimization studies were recently completed and the product is entering engineering manufacturing, which we expect will enable us to enter first-in-human testing in a dose-escalation and challenge study by the end of 2023, pending submission and FDA clearance of an IND.

17



Vaccitech plans to include pharmacodynamic analysis as part of the Phase 1 study to provide an indication that the immunotherapy is inducing Tregs. Importantly, Vaccitech also intends to include a controlled gluten challenge in the Phase 1 study (for example, see Goel G, et al. Science Advances (2019) Cytokine release and gastrointestinal symptoms after gluten challenge in celiac disease). This controlled gluten challenge is intended to provide an early biologic signal that VTP-1000 suppresses pathological response to gluten ingestion.
As VTP-1000 is our first product candidate directed towards the treatment of an inflammatory disease, we believe demonstration of Treg induction and/or suppression of unwanted immune responses to gluten would pave the way for other therapies based on the SNAPvax tolerizing immunotherapy platform, including those for allergies and other autoimmune indications.
VTP-600: Our Immunotherapeutic Candidate Targeting MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO1 Antigens
We are developing VTP-600, our immunotherapy candidate designed to encode the tumor-associated antigens MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO1 initially for the treatment of NSCLC in combination with standard of care treatment, chemotherapy and pembrolizumab. Lung cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis and cause of cancer death worldwide, with 85% of cases classified as NSCLC. About 25% to 30% of NSCLC patients have squamous histology and the remainder have non-squamous histology. MAGE-A3 is expressed in 48% of squamous NSCLC and 24% of non- squamous NSCLC. NY-ESO1 has been shown to have an expression rate of 27% across all NSCLC types. We initiated a first-in-human Phase 1/2a trial in the first quarter of 2022, in collaboration with Cancer Research UK, or CRUK, which is sponsoring and funding this study.
VTP-400: A Prophylactic Vaccine Product Candidate for Shingles
Beyond our therapeutic programs, we are also developing several prophylactic vaccine candidates. VTP-400 is our vaccine candidate in development to prevent shingles in adults aged 50 years and older. There are an estimated 140 million cases globally of shingles each year, which can result in significant post-infection pain, known as post-herpetic neuralgia, or even death. Our regional partner in China and Southeast Asia, CanSino, plans to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of VTP-400 for shingles prevention.
VTP-500: A Prophylactic Vaccine Candidate to Prevent MERS
We are developing VTP-500 as a vaccine product candidate to prevent infection and subsequent disease caused by the MERS coronavirus. Although human-to-human transmission appears to be rare, MERS coronavirus has the potential to cause epidemics, infecting hundreds of thousands of people and causing significant morbidity and mortality in 34% of infected individuals. Clinical efficacy trials to prevent MERS are challenging to execute due to the sporadic nature of infection, however studies have demonstrated positive Phase 1 safety and immunogenicity infections data. In November 2021, VTP-500 results from the Saudi Arabia Phase 1 study were published in The Lancet Microbe. The Phase 1 data showed that VTP-500 was generally well tolerated in patients, and further development of the product candidate is planned by our non-exclusive licensee, the University of Oxford.
Vaxzevria: A Prophylactic Vaccine for the Prevention of COVID-19 Infection 
We believe our platform also positions us to develop vaccines rapidly to address epidemic and pandemic threats, as demonstrated by the speed of the initiation of clinical trials of Vaxzevria (formerly VTP-900 and AZD1222) for the prevention of COVID-19, which entered the clinic within three months from initial antigen design. We co-invented our first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate VTP-900, now Vaxzevria, in partnership with the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, which we assigned to OUI to facilitate the licensing of those rights by OUI to AstraZeneca. Vaxzevria, uses the ChAdOx1 vector, and encodes the SARS-CoV2 spike protein.
On June 28, 2021, a sub-analysis from the Oxford-led COV001 and COV002 trials showed that Vaxzevria induced strong immune responses following either a prolonged second dose interval of up to 45 weeks or following a third boosting dose. The results, published by the University of Oxford in The Lancet on September 1, 2021, demonstrated that antibody levels remain elevated from baseline for at least one year following a single dose. An extended interval between the first and second dose of Vaxzevria of up to 45 weeks, resulted in up to an 18-fold increase in antibody response, measured 28 days after the second dose. With a 45 week dosing interval between the first and second dose, antibody titres were four times higher than with a 12 week interval, demonstrating that a longer dosing interval is not detrimental but can derive stronger immunity. In addition, a third dose of Vaxzevria, given at least 6 months after a second dose, boosted antibody levels six-fold and maintained T cell response. A third dose also resulted in higher neutralising activity against the Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants.

18



On January 13, 2022, AstraZeneca announced positive results from a preliminary analysis of an ongoing safety and immunogenicity trial which showed that Vaxzevria, when given as a third dose booster, increased the immune response to Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma SARS-CoV-2 variants, while a separate analysis of samples from the trial showed increased antibody response to the Omicron variant. The results were observed among individuals previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine. AstraZeneca also announced that the vaccine has been granted a conditional marketing authorization or emergency use in more than 90 countries. It also has Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization, which accelerates the pathway to access in up to 144 countries through the COVAX Facility.
As of November 1, 2022, more than 3 billion doses of Vaxzevria have been supplied across 180 countries globally. It has been estimated that over 6 million lives have been saved worldwide, and between 37.7 and 122.4 million hospitalizations were prevented. We are eligible to receive a share of royalties and other revenue received by OUI pursuant to its agreement with AstraZeneca for Vaxzevria.
Our History and Team
We were founded in May 2016 as a spin-out from a leading institution in the United Kingdom, the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, with the aim of developing and commercializing innovative immunotherapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent infectious diseases and cancer. Our platform uses technologies that were developed at the Jenner Institute over 15 years and through clinical trials involving thousands of participants. Our scientific founders, Professor Adrian Hill KBE, FRCP, FRS and Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert DBE, are leaders in the fields of infectious diseases, immunology, vaccine development and viral vectors. Professor Hill is the founding Director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford and is also the Lakshmi Mittal and Family Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford. Professor Gilbert is Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Oxford and leads programs on the development of vaccines against multiple emerging viral pathogens as well as research into vaccine manufacturing. She was the Oxford Project Lead for the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine project.
We have assembled a management team with extensive expertise in building and operating biopharmaceutical organizations that have discovered, developed and delivered innovative medicines to patients. Our management team has broad experience and successful track records in biopharmaceutical research, clinical development, regulatory affairs, manufacturing and commercialization, as well as in business, operations, and finance. Our management team’s experience was gained at leading institutions that include Agalimmune, Akamis Bio, Altimmune, Aptiv Solutions, Ernst & Young, GenVec, IAVI, Kite Pharma, Pfizer, Merck-Serono, Novartis and Roche.
Our board of directors has extensive expertise in the fields of science, business and finance. Our scientific advisory board, or SAB, works with our management team in the planning and development of scientific, clinical, and research and development initiatives and strategies. The SAB is composed of scientific and clinical thought leaders in the fields of immunotherapy, vaccine development, immunology, infectious diseases, immunotolerance and oncology.
The Key Elements of Our Platform
Our proprietary platforms comprise several components that either 1) when combined, allow us to develop product candidates designed to induce high and durable levels of antigen-specific T cells and B cells to prevent and treat infectious diseases and, cancer or 2) in the case of SNAPvax, induce regulatory T cells and/or decrease T cell activation to specifically control autoreactive immune cell hyperactivity, while maintaining the desired tolerability profile. Our immunostimulatory platforms generate excellent immunogenicity in terms of B cell and T cell responses and are differentiated by their ability to induce very high numbers of functional and durable CD8+ T cells. Our tolerizing platform is designed to restore immune tolerance by a mechanism of action, which includes the induction of regulatory T cells. The key elements of our platforms are:

● | Proprietary Simian Vectors: ChAdOx1 and ChAdOx2 are modified simian adenoviral vectors which deliver target antigens into cells to generate a specific immune response. These viruses were originally isolated from chimpanzees to avoid pre-existing immunity issues affecting the use of human adenovirus vectors. Researchers at the Jenner Institute modified the ChAdOx viruses to be non-replicating and to have an increased antigen-carrying capacity. To date, we have developed several vaccine and immunotherapy candidates with the ChAdOx vectors, each carrying target antigens that are specific to desired pathogens and diseases. Adenoviral vectors have demonstrable safety profiles and are immunogenic in all age groups evaluated to date.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Well-Validated Boost Vector: MVA is a highly attenuated vaccinia virus used to deliver target antigens into cells to generate or boost an immune response. MVA has a large antigen-carrying capacity and is especially immunogenic when used as a boosting vector in a heterologous prime- boost regimen. MVA is replication-deficient and has a well-documented safety profile in hundreds of thousands of people, and is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in both Europe and the US.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Proprietary Promoters and Enhancers: Promoters and molecular enhancers are genetic codes that influence antigen expression. For our adenoviral vectors, we use a proprietary promoter that is modified from cytomegalovirus. The use of this modified promoter has been shown to increase antigen expression and also the resulting immune response. For our MVA vector, we use a proprietary promoter to control expression of recombinant antigens and thereby enhance T cell induction levels. We may use molecular adjuvants to enhance the CD8+ T cell response.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Antigen Selection and Design: We select full-length and subunit antigenic sequences from targeted pathogens, autoimmune targets or cancer targets. We employ unique antigen design strategies to optimize in vivo immune presentation and maximize the desired type of immunogenicity while maintaining the desired tolerability profile. For example, some target diseases may require a greater T cell-mediated response, whereas others may require a more balanced T and B cell response. We use cutting-edge bioinformatics methods to design and optimize our antigen-encoding vectors. To select antigen targets for pathogens, we use databases to rank options based on factors including global distribution of genetic strains, evolutionary competitive advantage, known pathogenicity and sequence upload bias. We design our antigens to achieve maximal antigen presenting cell processing to elicit T cells.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rapid Vector Generation and Manufacturing: We employ manipulation of adenovirus genomes to enable rapid generation of recombinant adenoviral vectors to meet GMP standards. We believe our sequencing techniques have the potential to result in safer, more stable, product candidates. Our adenovirus product candidates can be manufactured at exceptional speed and to significant scale, as it has been demonstrated with the COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria. Vaxzevria, which is based on the ChAdOx1 vector, was designed, constructed and manufactured for human use within three months. Normal GMP production processes typically take six to ten months each for adenovirus and for MVA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Syntholytic and SNAPvax platforms allow for the presentation of essentially any chosen peptide to the immune system on a nanoparticle. This platform allows for small molecules, such as Toll-like receptor agonists or inducers of T regulatory cells, to be co-delivered to the target cells. The immunostimulatory SNAPvax platform has induced high magnitude, functional CD8+ T cells, especially when given as part of a prime-boost combination with ChAdOx1 in preclinical studies in mice and non-human primates. The tolerizing SNAPvax platform has shown promising data on protection from disease in a mouse model of autoimmunity. The products can be delivered by either the intramuscular or intravenous route, can modify innate immune function, and can be given repeatedly.

Our Collaboration and License Agreements
2016 License Agreement with OUI
In March 2016, we entered into a license agreement, or the 2016 OUI License Agreement (as amended in January 2019 and April 2020), with OUI (previously known as Isis Innovation Limited) for the development and commercialization of vaccines for influenza, cancer (including therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines and including cancer associated with viral infections), varicella zoster and MERS. We refer to these areas together as the “Field.”
Pursuant to the 2016 OUI License Agreement, OUI granted us a worldwide license under certain patent rights of OUI, including rights related to the use of ChAdOx1, ChAdOx2, adenoviral and MVA promoters and influenza product candidates, among other rights, or the Licensed Technology, to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products. The rights are exclusive in certain fields and non-exclusive in others. Our license to certain patents and applications relating to certain adenoviral vectors encoding a pathogen or tumor antigen and certain pox virus expression systems is exclusive within the Field, non- exclusive in all other fields, and excludes veterinary applications. Our license to certain patents and applications relating to certain compositions and methods is exclusive in all fields and excludes veterinary applications. Our license for the use of the ChAdOx1 vector under certain patents and applications relating to certain simian adenovirus and hybrid adenoviral vectors is exclusive in the Field, non-exclusive in all other fields, and excludes veterinary applications (apart from MERS) and certain specified indications. Furthermore, our license with respect to the use of the ChAdOx2 vector under certain patents and applications relating to certain adenoviral vectors is exclusive in certain vaccine-related fields, non- exclusive in all other fields, and excludes all veterinary applications (apart from MERS) and certain other specified indications. In addition, we also obtained a license to certain clinical data generated from OUI projects and related confidential know-how to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products, and such license is exclusive in the Field, other than with respect to know-how related to ChAdOx2, which is licensed non-exclusively. The Licensed Technology is sublicensable subject to obtaining OUI’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and inclusion in any sublicense agreement of restrictions on further sub-licensing, among other terms and conditions.

2017 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with NIH (Vaccitech North America, Inc.)
In February 2017, Avidea entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to carry out collaborative research for the evaluation of Avidea’s synthetic, polymer-based vaccine technology, “Immunotherapeutic Nanoscaffolds” (IMNs) for infectious disease prevention and cancer treatment in animal models. Under this CRADA Avidea committed to providing scientific staff together with materials for use in experiments to evaluate their performance in various animal models of infectious disease and cancer. Under this CRADA NIH committed to evaluating Avidea materials in animal models and to perform comprehensive immune analysis. No funding was exchanged under this CRADA. 
In October 2019, the CRADA was amended (“1st CRADA Amendment”) to expand the scope of the collaborative research to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Avidea’s polymer-based vaccine technology, “Immunotherapeutic Nanoscaffolds” (IMNs), including Star polymers and self-assembling nanoparticles based on amphiphilic polymers (SNAP), in preclinical animal models for cancer, infectious and inflammatory diseases. Under this 1st CRADA Amendment Avidea committed to increase its scientific staffing contribution and to provide funding of $22,500 by October 15, 2019 and a further $62,500 by October 15, 2020. 
In October 2020, the CRADA was further amended (“2nd CRADA Amendment”) to defer payment of Avidea’s October 2020 funding contribution of the 1st CRADA Amendment to April 15, 2021. 
In May 2021, the CRADA was further amended (“3rd CRADA Amendment”) to extend the term of the CRADA by 2 additional years and to defer payment of Avidea’s April 2021 funding contribution of the 2nd CRADA Amendment to October 31, 2021. 
In November 2021, the CRADA was further amended (“4th CRADA Amendment”) to expand the scope of the collaborative research to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Avidea’s polymer-based vaccine technology, “Immunotherapeutic Nanoscaffolds” (IMNs), including Star polymers and self-assembling nanoparticles based on amphiphilic polymers (SNAP), in preclinical animal models for cancer, infectious and inflammatory diseases (e.g., induction of suppression and/or tolerance for treating or preventing allergies, autoimmunity, and transplant rejection). 
In October 2022, the CRADA was further amended (“5th CRADA Amendment”) to acknowledge that all of Avidea’s rights, duties and obligations under the CRADA were assumed by Vaccitech North America, Inc. (“Vaccitech NA”) following the acquisition of Avidea by Vaccitech plc. on December 10, 2021. 
Under the CRADA as amended we own inventions made solely by our staff, and we have an option to enter an exclusive or nonexclusive license to any inventions made solely by NIH staff or made jointly by our staff and NIH under the CRADA. NIH retains rights on behalf of the U.S. Government in the Licensed Technology as required by statute and NIH policy. We have an option to exclusively license any further inventions made under the CRADA.

2019 License Agreement with NIH (Vaccitech North America, Inc.)
In September 2019, Avidea entered into a license agreement with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for the commercial development of products and processes for the prevention and/or treatment of cancer and infectious diseases within the scope of Licensed Patent rights that had been developed under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (“CRADA”) entered into by NIH and Avidea in February 2017 and amended in March 2019, December 2020, May 2021, November 2021 and October 2022. We are co-owners of all the Licensed Patents under this agreement, and we have an option to exclusively license NIH rights in all inventions made under this CRADA.
All of Avidea’s rights, duties and obligations under the 2019 License Agreement with NIH were assumed by Vaccitech North America, Inc. (“Vaccitech NA”) following the acquisition of Avidea by Vaccitech plc. on December 10, 2021. The 2019 License Agreement with NIH was amended in September 2022 to note Vaccitech NA’s rights, duties and obligations and also to include newly filed patents developed under the 2017 CRADA as amended.
Pursuant to the 2019 License Agreement with NIH, NIH granted us a worldwide exclusive license under certain patent rights co-owned by us and NIH related to the use of the SNAPvax and syntholytic technology platforms, among other rights, or the Licensed Technology, to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products. The license to patent rights are exclusive in all fields. The Licensed Technology is sublicensable subject to obtaining NIH’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) and inclusion of other customary provisions. NIH retains rights on behalf of the U.S. Government in the Licensed Technology as required by statute and NIH policy.
Upon execution of the 2019 License Agreement with NIH, we paid NIH a one-time upfront fee of $20,000. We are obligated to pay NIH a low single-digit royalty on net sales of any product or process produced by or using the Licensed Technology. If we sublicense the Licensed Technology, we will be required to pay NIH a low-single-digit royalty on any non-royalty sublicensing income. As of March 23, 2023, NIH has not been paid any royalties under the 2019 License Agreement with NIH. In the event that the royalties (excluding the royalty on sublicensing income) owed to NIH do not amount to a specified minimum ranging from the low to mid five figures based on the license year in each year following September 2019, the licensee must also pay NIH the difference between the royalty paid and the applicable minimum royalty payment. Within 60 days of execution of the 2019 License Agreement with NIH we paid $5,000 to NIH. Within 60 days of January 1, 2020 $5,000 was paid to NIH, being the difference between royalties paid and the minimum sum payable. Within 60 days of January 1, 2021 $5,000 was paid to NIH, being the difference between royalties paid and the minimum sum payable. Within 60 days of January 1, 2022 $10,000 was paid to NIH, being the difference between royalties paid and the minimum sum payable. Within 60 days of January 1, 2023 $10,000 was paid to NIH, being the difference between royalties paid and the minimum sum payable. In addition, we are required to pay NIH milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $3.24 million upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each Licensed Product. 
Unless earlier terminated, the 2019 License Agreement with NIH will continue until expiry of the last to expire Licensed Patent. 5 patent families licensed under the 2019 License Agreement with NIH that cover the SNAPvax platform, if granted, are expected to expire in April 2038, in May 2039, in October 2039, in February 2042 and in June 2042, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Two patent families licensed under the 2019 License Agreement with NIH that cover the syntholytic platform, if granted, are expected to expire in April 2040 and in October 2041, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Either party may terminate for the uncured breach of the other party. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice. NIH may terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events. 
2017 Research Collaboration Agreement (“RCA”) with Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, Prague (Vaccitech North America, Inc.)
In September 2017, Avidea entered into a Research Collaboration Agreement (“RCA”) with the Czech Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, (“IMC”) to carry out collaborative research for the development of polymer-based immunotherapies for cancer treatment, HIV prevention and recombinant protein delivery. Under this RCA Avidea committed to providing bioactive moecules and to developing and deploying animal models for evaluating immunotherapies. Under this RCA IMC committed to synthesizing various polymers and bioactive molecules and to linking such polymers and bioactive molecules for use in experiments to characterize their physicochemical properties. No funding was exchanged under this RCA. All of Avidea’s rights, duties and obligations under the 2017 RCA with IMC were assumed by Vaccitech North America, Inc. (“Vaccitech NA”) following the acquisition of Avidea by Vaccitech plc. on December 10, 2021. 
Under the RCA we own inventions made solely by our staff, and we have an exclusive option to enter an exclusive or nonexclusive license to any inventions made solely by IMC staff or made jointly by our staff and IMC under the RCA. We have secured exclusive 

24



rights in two patent families that we co-own with IMC under the 2022 License Agreement with IMC as described below. We have an exclusive option to exclusively license any further inventions made under the RCA. The RCA expired on September 18, 2022. Our rights in inventions made under the RCA survive expiry of the RCA.
2022 License Agreement with IMC (Vaccitech North America, Inc.)
In April 2022, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Czech Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry, (“IMC”) for the exploitation, development and commercialization of technologies and products within the scope of Licensed Patent rights that had been developed under a Research Collaboration Agreement (“RCA”) entered into by IMC and Avidea in September 2017. We are co-owners of all the Licensed Patents under this agreement, and we have an option to exclusively license IMC rights in all inventions made under this RCA.
Pursuant to the 2022 License Agreement with IMC, IMC granted us a worldwide, exclusive license under certain patent rights co-owned by us and IMC related to the use of polymer-based immunotherapies, among other rights, or the Licensed Technology, to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products. The license to patent rights is exclusive in all fields. The Licensed Technology is sublicensable. 
We are obligated to pay IMC a low single-digit royalty on net sales of any product or process produced by or using the Licensed Technology. If we sublicense the Licensed Technology, we will be required to pay IMC a low-single-digit royalty on any non-royalty sublicensing income. As of March 23, 2023, IMC has not been paid any royalties under the 2022 License Agreement with IMC. In addition, we are required to pay IMC milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $820,000 upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones for each Licensed Product. 
Unless earlier terminated, the 2022 License Agreement with IMC will continue until expiry of the last valid claim of the Licensed Patents. One patent family licensed under the 2022 License Agreement with IMC that covers the SNAPvax platform, if granted, is expected to expire in September 2041, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. One patent family licensed under the 2022 License Agreement with IMC that covers the syntholytic platform, if granted, is expected to expire in April 2040, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Either party may terminate for the uncured breach or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 3 months’ prior written notice.
2019 License Agreement with OUI
In January 2019, we entered into an additional license agreement with OUI, or the 2019 OUI License Agreement. Pursuant to the 2019 OUI License Agreement, OUI granted us a worldwide, license under an additional patent application of OUI related to the rapid production of recombinant adenovirus constructs, to be used as personalized cancer vaccines or emerging pathogen vaccines, and related confidential know-how, or the 2019 Licensed Technology, to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize licensed products. The license is exclusive in the field of personalized cancer vaccines for therapeutic use in humans, non- exclusive in in all other fields and excludes veterinary applications (apart from MERS) and certain other specified indications. The license is sublicensable subject to obtaining OUI’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and inclusion in any sublicense agreement of restrictions on further sub-licensing, among other terms.
Pursuant to the 2019 OUI License Agreement, all intellectual property rights resulting from improvements made prior to the second anniversary of the agreement (i) to the licensed patent rights by the inventor belong to OUI, and (ii) to the 2019 Licensed Technology by us belong to us. OUI retains the right for the University of Oxford and any person who works or has worked on the Licensed Technology to use the 2019 Licensed Technology, as well as any improvements that we make to that technology during the first two years of the license, for education, research and limited clinical patient care. Furthermore, the University of Oxford may publish the 2019 Licensed Technology and those improvements without our consent provided that they have first given us advance notice and delayed the publication if necessary for us to obtain patent protection. In addition, OUI retains the right to grant academic and research licenses to any third parties under the 2019 Licensed Technology to encourage basic research for education and limited clinical patient care but may not grant licenses for commercialization of the 2019 Licensed Technology that is exclusively licensed to us, nor for development or marketing or products or services that are produced or supplied using the 2019 Licensed Technology.

25



Upon execution of the 2019 OUI License Agreement, we paid OUI a nominal upfront fee. We are required to pay OUI a variable low single-digit royalty on net sales of products we develop using the 2019 Licensed Technology, which varies depending on whether the sales are within or outside of the field of personalized cancer vaccines for therapeutic use in humans. While we are continuing to develop the 2019 Licensed Technology, no product candidate that we are currently developing incorporates this technology. If we sublicense the 2019 Licensed Technology, we will be required to pay OUI a 15% or 7% royalty (for licensed products within the field and outside the field respectively) on any royalties paid to us by the sublicensee and 15% or 7.5% of non-royalty sublicensing income (for sublicenses granted before or after three years after the date of the agreement respectively). In the event that the aforementioned royalties (excluding the royalty on non-royalty sublicensing income) owed to OUI do not amount to a specified minimum ranging from the mid five figures to low six figures based on the license year in each year following January 2022, we must also pay to OUI the difference between the royalty paid and the applicable minimum sum payable. In addition, if we develop at least two products in the Field, we are required to pay OUI milestone payments of up to an aggregate of £1.9 million upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones.
Subject to earlier termination, the 2019 OUI License Agreement will continue until the later of the expiration of the last claim of a licensed patent or 20 years from the date of the agreement. The last patent under the 2019 OUI License Agreement, if granted, is expected to expire in August 2039, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Either party may terminate for the uncured breach of the other party. At any time after the third anniversary of the agreement, we may terminate the agreement at any time upon three months’ prior written notice. OUI may terminate the agreement upon us filing for bankruptcy or in the event of liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon 30 days’ prior written notice upon the occurrence of certain other events. Upon termination of the 2019 OUI License Agreement, we are required to, among other things, grant to OUI an irrevocable, transferable, non- exclusive license to develop, make and use any improvements (to the technology embodied by the relevant licensed patent and know-how) which we made prior to the second anniversary of the date of the agreement.
2018 License Agreement with OUI and Oxford
In September 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the 2018 License Agreement, with The Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford, or Oxford, and OUI. Pursuant to the 2016 OUI License Agreement, OUI had granted us certain exclusive rights related to the Licensed Technology, as defined in the 2016 OUI License Agreement, in the field of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of MERS. The 2018 License Agreement enables Oxford to grant a further sublicense to CEPI in the field of MERS, or the Field, and to enable Oxford to conduct related activities.
Pursuant to the 2018 License Agreement, we agreed to grant to Oxford a fully-paid-up, worldwide, non- exclusive license under the Licensed Technology, as defined in the 2016 OUI License Agreement, and developments and improvements to such technology controlled by us during the term of the 2016 OUI License Agreement, or the MERS Technology, in the Field solely for the purpose of enabling Oxford to develop any product or process which uses or is within the scope of the MERS Technology, or Licensed Product. This license includes the right to generate investigational stockpiles, but excludes any commercial use or sale of Licensed Products and is sublicensable by Oxford solely to its collaborators under the framework agreement entered into on or about the same date as the 2018 License Agreement between Oxford, CEPI and Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. Furthermore, we agreed that the rights retained by OUI under the 2016 OUI License Agreement include the right to allow Oxford to use the MERS Technology to carry out research activities (including in collaboration with other parties) up to and including the performance of Phase 1/2 clinical trials and related activities, and the generation of Licensed Product for research use (but excluding any commercial use or sale of such Licensed Product). We have been informed by Oxford that Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. is no longer a party to that framework agreement.
In addition, we agreed to grant to Oxford a fully-paid-up, worldwide, non-exclusive license under the MERS Technology in the Field solely for the purpose of enabling Oxford to grant a sublicense to CEPI in order to address (i) circumstances in which CEPI determines there to be a heightened need for the Licensed Product and that steps should be taken to prepare for such need; and/or (ii) material increases in the number of cases of people infected with MERS in particular geographical areas that are declared a public health emergency. Oxford is permitted to grant CEPI a fully-paid-up, worldwide, non-exclusive sublicense under the MERS Technology to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Product in the Field anywhere in the world, provided that all end users (i) are in a relevant affected territory, or (ii) are healthcare workers going to an affected territory under the direction of one or more governments or recognized not-for-profit organizations, or Public Sector Agencies, in order to help address a public healthcare issue. However, the sublicense must exclude the right for CEPI to (i) apply for or obtain any marketing approval or conduct any post-marketing activities, (ii) sell Licensed Product other than to Public Sector Agencies on a “cost plus” basis, where “cost plus” means the cost of manufacturing and supply plus a margin of 10% percent on such cost, or (iii) further sublicense its rights other than to its affiliates and/or to Public Sector Agencies and their appointees for the sole purpose of accelerating epidemic preparedness for public health applications.

26



Pursuant to the 2018 License Agreement, OUI agreed that, notwithstanding our payment obligations under the 2016 OUI License Agreement, we are not obligated to make any payment to OUI in connection with the 2018 License Agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, the 2018 License Agreement shall remain in full force until the expiry or termination of the 2016 OUI License Agreement. We may terminate the 2018 License Agreement immediately upon notice to Oxford in the event of Oxford’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination of the 2018 License Agreement, provided that CEPI is not in breach of the terms of its sublicense, we shall at CEPI’s request grant it a sublicense under the MERS Technology in the Field solely of the scope outlined above and on materially the same terms, to the extent that we are able to do so.
OUI License Agreement Amendment
In April 2020, we entered into an amendment, assignment and revenue share agreement, or the OUI License Agreement Amendment, with OUI to amend the 2016 OUI License Agreement. Pursuant to the 2016 OUI License Agreement and among other rights and obligations, OUI granted to us a non-exclusive license to certain patent applications relating to its ChAdOx1 and ChAdOx2 vaccine vectors and the adenovirus long promoter for use in certain fields, or the Field, including SARS-CoV2, which is the virus known to cause COVID-19. The OUI License Agreement Amendment was entered into to enable a single exclusive license agreement for a COVID-19 vaccine co-developed by us and the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute to be negotiated with a suitable pharmaceutical partner.
Under the OUI License Agreement Amendment, we agreed to exclude SARS-CoV2 from the Field and to cease use of the ChAdOx1 vector, ChAdOx2 vector and the adenovirus long promoter in SARS-CoV2. In addition, we assigned to OUI our rights to a jointly owned U.K. patent application relating to the composition of matter related to a ChAdOx1 vector-based or a ChAdOx2 vector-based vaccine to prevent COVID-19, or the Assigned Patent Application, as well as certain other intellectual property rights related to any ChAdOx1 vector-based or ChAdOx2 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine covered by the Assigned Patent Application and its manufacture, including rights to the variations, improvements and modifications thereof, whether existing at or arising after the date of the OUI License Agreement Amendment. In consideration of the rights granted by us, OUI agreed to pay us approximately 24% of payments, including royalties and milestones, received by OUI in connection with the commercialization of any ChAdOx1 vector-based or ChAdOx2 vector-based vaccine in the field of SARS-CoV2 covered by or disclosed in the assigned patent application. The last patent under the OUI License Agreement Amendment, which is owned by OUI, if granted, is expected to expire in March 2041, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments.
Impact of OUI’s Agreement with AstraZeneca
OUI has entered into an exclusive research collaboration and worldwide license agreement, or the AstraZeneca License Agreement, with AstraZeneca UK Limited, or AstraZeneca. The following description of the impact of AstraZeneca License Agreement with respect to our rights under the OUI License Agreement Amendment is based solely on an extract of the AstraZeneca License Agreement provided by the parties to that agreement. We are not a party to the AstraZeneca License Agreement and do not have access to a copy of that agreement to verify the accuracy of such extract. In addition, no party to the AstraZeneca License Agreement has confirmed that there are no material terms in that agreement that are not included in the description below that could adversely impact the economic and other terms of the AstraZeneca License Agreement described below. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the AstraZeneca License Agreement is an enforceable agreement, that the parties thereto will comply with their obligations under that agreement (including any obligations of AstraZeneca to make milestone or royalty payments to OUI), or that the terms of that agreement (including royalty rates and other economic terms) will not be modified by the parties in the future. Accordingly, these and other factors could cause amounts received by OUI pursuant to the AstraZeneca License Agreement to differ from those described below, and any such differences could be material.
The AstraZeneca License Agreement allows AstraZeneca to pursue, among other things, the commercialization of a vaccine product candidate for the prevention of COVID-19 containing one or more of the ChAdOx1 or ChAdOx2 vectors or their derivatives. AstraZeneca announced that as of January 13, 2022, the vaccine had been granted a conditional marketing authorization or emergency use in more than 90 countries. It also has Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization, which accelerates the pathway to access in up to 144 countries through the COVAX Facility.
Pursuant to the OUI License Agreement Amendment, we received $2.4 million in July 2020 as our share of the upfront fee paid by AstraZeneca. We are also entitled to receive a share of certain regulatory and sales milestones and royalties on net sales of Vaxzevria, as well as a portion of any sublicensing income payable by AstraZeneca. Our share of the royalties on net sales of Vaxzevria is approximately 1.4%.

27



Our understanding is that we were not entitled to receive any royalties or payments from sub-licensees from the commercialization of Vaxzevria until after the pandemic period, which was defined as a period that would end on July 1, 2021 (or such later date when AstraZeneca, in good faith, determines that the COVID-19 pandemic is over). However, our understanding is that we would be entitled to receive our share of any regulatory milestone payments during the pandemic period.
The royalty term for net sales of Vaxzevria commenced in 2022 and will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) the date upon which the vaccine is no longer subject to patent protection in such country, (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the vaccine in such country or (iii) ten years from the first commercial sale of the vaccine in such country.
Master Collaboration Agreement with CanSino Biologics Inc.
In September 2018, we entered into a master collaboration agreement, or the CanSino Agreement, with CanSino Biologics Inc., or CanSino. The CanSino Agreement provides a framework under which we can agree with CanSino (in separate project agreements) the details of one or more collaborative projects for the development and commercialization of certain products, and carry out those projects under the terms of the CanSino Agreement and the respective project agreements in our respective territories. Under the CanSino Agreement, the CanSino Territory includes China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao), Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia, Laos, Vietnam, and the Philippines, while our territory, or the Vaccitech Territory, includes the rest of the world.
Under the CanSino Agreement, each party grants to the other party a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use its relevant background intellectual property rights, or Background IPR, solely to perform the project in the other party’s territory, together with a right to sub-license to any agreed-upon subcontractor performing services for and on behalf of the other party. For any collaborative project, each party is obliged to provide to the other party all applicable materials specified in that project agreement and to grant to the other party a non-exclusive license to use such materials solely for the purpose of that project. In addition, each party grants to the other party a non-exclusive license to use its Background IPR and an exclusive license to any new intellectual property created in the course of activities performed by such party in relation to a project or otherwise under the CanSino Agreement, or New IPR, to the extent necessary to commercialize and exploit collaboration products in the other party’s territory. Such commercialization licenses are sublicensable (without further right to sub-license) and subject to the payment of royalties and milestones as set out in the relevant project agreement. CanSino is permitted to commercialize such products only in the CanSino Territory and we are entitled to commercialize such products in the Vaccitech Territory. Both parties are under obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize sales of products that are the subject of collaboration.
During the term of any project agreement entered into as contemplated by the CanSino Agreement and for three months thereafter, neither party is permitted to enter into discussions, collaborations or similar arrangements with any third parties regarding matters or products which are materially the same as set forth in the project agreement or related to the project that is the subject of the project agreement, unless such party reasonably believes such an arrangement with such third party would not be detrimental to the relevant project or project arrangement. Furthermore, unless agreed otherwise in a project agreement, for any product which we collaboratively develop, CanSino has the exclusive and sub-licensable right to manufacture and supply all master virus seed and clinical adenoviral material necessary for the development and sale of any products by either party in their respective territories. CanSino will supply any such material to be used by us for the manufacture of products to be sold by us (or our sub-licensees) at the price of 15% to 30% over cost of goods sold, or COGS. COGS is equal to the reasonable COGS for equivalent material manufactured by CanSino or its subcontractors for sale by CanSino or its sub-licensees.
Unless agreed otherwise in a project agreement: (i) any improvements of a party’s Background IPR will be owned by the party with rights to such Background IPR, and will be treated as Background IPR; and (ii) New IPR will be owned by one or both parties in accordance with the respective inventive contribution of each party as determined by the principles of United Kingdom patent law. Where any New IPR is wholly owned by a party, that party is obliged to endeavor to file patent applications to the extent required to provide reasonable protection for the relevant product. Where any New IPR is jointly owned by the parties, we are obliged to endeavor to file patent applications to the extent required to provide reasonable protection for the relevant product, in consultation with CanSino, with costs shared between the parties. Before we abandon a jointly-owned patent claiming any New IPR, we must give CanSino at least three months’ notice, and CanSino can request assignment of our rights on terms to be agreed. We are obliged to discuss with CanSino the enforcement of jointly owned patent rights but are entitled to enforce such patent rights outside the CanSino Territory.

28



Unless earlier terminated, the CanSino Agreement will continue for ten years from the date of the agreement. Either party can terminate by written notice for the uncured material breach or persistent breaches of the other party. Either party may terminate by written notice if the other party cannot pay its debts, takes any step in connection with entering administration, liquidation, or other arrangement with creditors (other than a solvent arrangement), or suspends all or part of its business; or suffers a force majeure event that continues for 60 days. Furthermore, a project agreement entered into pursuant to the CanSino Agreement shall automatically terminate if the 2016 OUI License Agreement or the 2017 OUI License Agreement terminates or expires, Background IPR licensed from OUI is necessary under such project agreement and the parties are unable to agree to a modification of the project or relevant collaboration product that would not require use of such Background IPR.
2018 ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement (under the CanSino Agreement)
Pursuant to the CanSino Agreement, we entered into a project agreement in September 2018 with CanSino, or the ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement, with the goal of developing a Zoster vaccine to become a competitor to Shingrix.
Under the ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement, we are responsible for funding and undertaking various development tasks, including (subject to availability of funding) conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in the UK. CanSino is responsible for funding and undertaking various development tasks, including conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in China. The parties’ rights and responsibilities in relation to Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are pending, subject to further negotiation. In addition, the parties agreed to use all reasonable efforts to enter into a separate supply agreement pursuant to which CanSino will manufacture all product necessary for clinical trials and commercialization under the project agreement. If the parties cannot agree upon such supply agreement, they must follow a specified dispute resolution process set forth in the CanSino Agreement. For all products manufactured by CanSino under a supply agreement that we wish to sell in the Vaccitech Territory, we have agreed to pay the costs incurred by CanSino to manufacture the products plus 20% of such costs.
We received an upfront payment of £50,000 under this project agreement. We will also receive milestone payments of up to an aggregate of £1.125 million based on successful conduct of clinical trials and commercialization of the product. We will receive mid-single-digit royalties on the net sales of the product by or on behalf of CanSino or its sub-licensees in the CanSino Territory. If CanSino sublicense their rights in the product to a non-affiliate third party, we are also entitled to receive a mid-teens royalty on the transaction value (excluding royalties). We must pay to CanSino mid-single-digit royalties on the net sales of the product by or on behalf of us or our sub-licensees in the Vaccitech Territory. A party will benefit from a reduction of its royalties (in the low single digits) where it requires a license from a third party to sell the product in its territory.
Unless earlier terminated, the term of the ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement will expire upon the later of expiry of all registered patents in the New IP developed under the project, or ten years from first commercial sale of the product. The last patent under the ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement, if granted, is expected to expire in November 2039, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. A party may terminate the ChAdOx Zoster Project Agreement by written notice if the other party unreasonably delays the performance of its obligations. Upon the expiration of the term, we agreed to grant CanSino a royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to use our Background IPR and our New IPR used to develop, incorporated in, or referenced in any products that are the subject of the project agreement to the extent necessary for CanSino to undertake research, develop, manufacture and commercialize such products in the CanSino Territory. Pursuant to the CanSino Agreement, upon the expiration or earlier termination of the project agreement, except for termination by CanSino for our breach, CanSino agreed to grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to use their Background IPR and New IPR used to develop, incorporated in, or referenced in any products that are the subject of the project agreement to the extent necessary for us to undertake research, develop, manufacture and commercialize such products in the Vaccitech Territory. Unless we terminate the project agreement early for CanSino’s breach, upon early termination after completion of a Phase 1 trial, we will continue to pay CanSino a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the product by us or our sub-licensees in the Vaccitech Territory, for the remainder of the Term. If such early termination is after completion of a Phase 2 trial, the royalty we must pay rises to mid-single digit.
Clinical Trial and Option Agreement with Cancer Research UK
In December 2019, Vaccitech Oncology Limited, or VOLT, entered into a clinical trial and option agreement, or the Clinical Trial Agreement, with CRUK and CRUK’s subsidiary, Cancer Research Technology Limited, or CRT, relating to the conduct of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of VOLT’s VTP-600 immunotherapy product in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or the Clinical Trial. The trial opened in the first quarter of 2022 across multiple clinical sites in the UK.

VOLT is our oncology focused strategic collaboration with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, an international non-profit organization that conducts innovative cancer research and is looking to enable the clinical development of new treatments that induce and harness CD8+ T cells of the immune system to fight cancer. VOLT has a license to our proprietary CD8+ T cell induction platform and research by Benoit Van den Eynde’s group at the Ludwig Oxford Branch.
Pursuant to the Clinical Trial Agreement, CRUK is responsible for, among other things, designing, preparing, carrying out and sponsoring the Clinical Trial, at its cost, and VOLT has granted to CRUK a license under its intellectual property to enable CRUK to perform such activities. VOLT is responsible for supplying agreed quantities of its VTP-600 immunotherapy product. VOLT retains the right to continue the development of the product during the Clinical Trial, provided that the parties have first agreed appropriate terms for sharing of safety data. CRUK owns all results, including all intellectual property therein, generated in the performance of the Clinical Trial. Upon the completion of the Clinical Trial, VOLT has the option to obtain a license to use such results, or the VTP-600 License. The terms of the VTP-600 License have been pre-agreed and are set out in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
If VOLT exercises the option to take the VTP-600 License, CRT agrees to grant VOLT an exclusive license under the results of the Clinical Trial that exclusively relate to the VTP-600 immunotherapy product, or the Exclusive Results, and a non-exclusive license under any results that are not Exclusive Results, in each case, to develop and commercialize any product which makes use of the results of the Clinical Trial in an application for regulatory authorization, contains the relevant active ingredients, or is covered by the patent application PCT/EP2019/070555, or the Product. The rights under the VTP-600 License are sublicensable (except to a tobacco company). The exclusive rights granted under the VTP-600 License are subject to the right of certain third-party contributors associated with the Clinical Trial, CRUK and scientists funded or employed by CRUK to use the Exclusive Results for non-commercial scientific or clinical research purposes and to publish the Exclusive Results and the results of non-commercial research performed using the Exclusive Results (subject to the publication process set out in the Clinical Trial Agreement). Upon exercise of the option, VOLT is required to pay a one-time upfront fee of an amount in pounds Sterling in the high six-digits. VOLT is also obligated to make future milestone payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, with an aggregate total value of £40,750,000. VOLT is required to pay to CRT a low single-digit royalty on net sales of Products sold by VOLT or its sublicensees. If VOLT sublicenses the right to sell Products, VOLT will also be required to pay to CRT a royalty of between 5% and 20% on non-royalty amounts due to VOLT from a sublicensee, with the precise rate depending on the stage in development at which such sublicense was granted. VOLT is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain development, regulatory and commercialization obligations, including commencement of a Phase 2 clinical trial of a Product in an oncology indication before the second anniversary of the date of the VTP-600 License. CRT may terminate the VTP-600 License in respect of any given Product if VOLT is not actively developing it or fails to launch it after receiving marketing authorization. CRT may also terminate the VTP-600 License as a whole if no Product is being actively developed or commercialized.
If VOLT does not exercise the option to take the VTP-600 License, or if the VTP-600 License or Clinical Trial Agreement is subsequently terminated by CRUK (as described below) VOLT will enter into a step-in agreement with CRT, or the Step-In Agreement. Pursuant to the Step-In Agreement, the terms of which have been pre-agreed and are set out in the Clinical Trial Agreement, VOLT will assign to CRT certain know- how and materials owned or controlled by VOLT. In addition, we agreed to grant to CRT an exclusive sub-license to a third-party patent family relating to viral vectors and methods for the prevention or treatment of cancer and non-exclusive sub-licenses to the HEK293 TetR Cell Line as well as certain third party patents and patent applications relating to certain adenovirus vectors and poxvirus expression systems, in each case, to develop and commercialize the Products on a revenue sharing basis. VOLT will receive a share of between 55% and 80% of the net revenue received by CRT for commercialization of the Product, with the precise share depending on the stage in development at which such Step-In Agreement is entered into.
The term of the Clinical Trial Agreement continues until it is otherwise terminated by the parties or, if the option is not exercised, upon the execution of the Step-In Agreement. The Clinical Trial Agreement can be terminated by either party upon an insolvency event in respect of the other party, for material breach of the other party, or upon a change of control of the other party (if the new controlling entity generates its revenue from the sale of tobacco products). If the Clinical Trial Agreement is terminated by CRUK for such causes prior to VOLT’s exercise of its option, VOLT will reimburse CRUK for all costs incurred or committed in connection with the Clinical Trial. In addition, CRUK may terminate the Clinical Trial Agreement at any time before the last cycle of treatment under the Clinical Trial is complete, in which case, upon VOLT’s request, CRT will grant the VTP-600 License to VOLT with appropriately reduced payments, to reflect the stage of the Clinical Trial at the date of termination. If the Clinical Trial Agreement is terminated for any reason after VOLT’s exercise of its option, VOLT may for three months following such termination continue to manufacture Products to the extent necessary to satisfy orders for Products accepted before such termination, and sell, use or otherwise dispose of Product inventory.

VOLT License Agreement
In November 2018, we entered into a license agreement, or the VOLT License Agreement, with VOLT. Pursuant to the VOLT License Agreement, we granted to VOLT a non-exclusive worldwide license under certain patent rights, know-how and materials related to the use of ChAdOx1, ChAdOx2, adenoviral and MVA promoters, and the TR293 Tet-Repressed Cell Line, or the VOLT Licensed Technology, to manufacture, use and commercialize any product which uses or is within the scope of the VOLT Licensed Technology, or VOLT Licensed Product. In part, the rights granted are a sublicense of rights granted to us by OUI under the 2016 OUI License Agreement. The license is sublicensable subject to obtaining OUI’s prior consent with respect to sublicensing of any of the VOLT Licensed Technology licensed to us by OUI (with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Pursuant to the VOLT License Agreement, we are required to make available to VOLT such further know- how relating to the manufacture of VOLT Licensed Products as we consider to be reasonably necessary or useful. We are also required to notify VOLT on a confidential basis of any improvements to the VOLT Licensed Technology that we develop or acquire rights in, and such improvements will be included within the scope of the license.
Unless earlier terminated, the VOLT License Agreement will continue until the later of the expiration of all patents included in the VOLT Licensed Technology or the know-how included in the VOLT Licensed Technology ceasing to be secret and substantial. The last patent under the VOLT License Agreement, if granted, is expected to expire in July 2039, without giving effect to any potential patent term extensions or patent term adjustments. Either party may terminate for the uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party. In the event of termination of the 2016 OUI License Agreement, we may terminate the VOLT License Agreement in respect of any of the VOLT Licensed Technology that is licensed to us by OUI, and VOLT and OUI shall enter into a direct license containing the same obligations and liabilities as set forth in the VOLT License Agreement.
The VOLT License Agreement was subsequently amended in July 2019 by two separate agreements for the research, development, and commercialization of cancer immunotherapy targeting MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 for the treatment of various forms of cancer under the VOLT Licensed Technology. Such amendments further elaborated on the parties’ respective rights and obligations, including with respect to VOLT’s payment obligations to us.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, to preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to protect our product candidates and technologies by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing of third-party intellectual property to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We, or our collaborators and licensors, file patent applications directed to our key product candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions to protect our product candidates as well as uses of our product candidates for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases.
As of March 23, 2023, we own a patent family relating to our novel regimens that includes two pending U.S. patent applications, two pending foreign patent applications and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application. In addition, we have in-licensed certain patent families relating to our key technology platforms and product candidates, including eight issued U.S. patents, eight pending U.S. patent applications, 16 issued foreign patents and 80 pending foreign patent applications. Following the acquisition of Avidea in December 2021 we control a further patent portfolio comprising in-licensed and co-owned patent families, including eight pending U.S. patent applications, (including two pending U.S. provisional patent applications), four issued foreign patents, 30 pending foreign patent applications and four pending PCT patent applications.

Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. All taxes, annuities or maintenance fees for a patent, as required by the USPTO and certain foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.

34



The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions and the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information about the risks associated with our efforts to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidates, and the enforcement of such intellectual property rights, as well as the risks associated with third party intellectual property rights, see the section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” With regard to our VTP-300 product candidate, we are aware of third- party patents in the United States with claims which may be relevant to this product candidate. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property — The intellectual property landscape around immunotherapeutics and viral-vector based vaccines is crowded and dynamic, and third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights and such claims may be costly and time-consuming and may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts.”
Government Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), and the Public Health Service Act (the “PHS Act”), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, marketing, promotion, export and import, advertising, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting involving biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Further, even if we obtain the required regulatory approvals for our products, pharmaceutical companies are subject to myriad federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws, rules, and regulations governing all aspects of our operations, including, but not limited to, our relationships with healthcare professionals, healthcare institutions, distributors of our products, and sales and marketing personnel; governmental and other third- party payor coverage and reimbursement of our products; and data privacy and security. Such laws, rules, and regulations are complex, continuously evolving, and, in many cases, have not been subject to extensive interpretation by applicable regulatory agencies or the courts. We are required to invest significant time and financial resources in policies, procedures, processes, and systems to ensure compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations, and our failure to do so may result in the imposition of substantial monetary or other penalties by federal or state regulatory agencies, give rise to reputational harm, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to GLPs and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

35




● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA, resulting in the licensure of the biological product for commercial marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any biological product candidate, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of the product’s biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to commencing an initial clinical trial in humans with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the biological product and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Once submitted, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold or partial clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under the control of, the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written trial protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur.
An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the trial and may recommend halting the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Certain information about certain clinical trials must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

36




● | Phase 2. The investigational product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, FDA may require, or firms may voluntarily pursue, post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biological product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

37



Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing trials. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

38



If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Orphan drug designation may also entitle a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation. The FDA may take other actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including holding meetings with the sponsor and providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development program.
A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

39



Additionally, drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner and send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if a confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA currently requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. The FDA may withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
Post-approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, as well as requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. After a BLA is approved for a biological product, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Manufacturers also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry- sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detentions or refusal to permit the import or export of the product, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with physicians or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws, including applicable tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain 

40



cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12 year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of litigation. As a result, the ultimate implementation and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
In addition to exclusivity under the BPCIA, a biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods, including some regulatory exclusivity periods tied to patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with 

41



applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all European Union Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Union, medicinal products, including biological medicinal products, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the European Union and national levels.
To obtain regulatory approval of a biological medicinal product under the European Union regulatory system, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the European Union: the decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure. A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EEA.

42



The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic-cell therapy and tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of viral diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and cancer. For those products for which the use of the centralized procedure is not mandatory, applicants may elect to use the centralized procedure where the product contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, and where the applicant can show that the product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a centralized process is in the interest of public health at a European Union level.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of whether a product meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether a product has a positive benefit-risk profile. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the timeframe of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
For products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure, national marketing authorizations may be obtained, which are issued by the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and only cover their respective territory. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an European Union Member State, this national marketing authorization can be recognized in another European Union Member State through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national marketing authorization in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various European Union Member States through the decentralized procedure. As with the centralized procedure, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy before granting the marketing authorization.
The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with certain exceptions. Directive 2001/83/EC and the laws in the Member States transposing this Directive into national law set out the requirements for an MAA. An MAA for a biological medicinal product must contain certain additional requirements to applications for other medicinal products, such as a description of the origin and history of the starting materials used for the product.
Data and Marketing Exclusivity
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving marketing authorization in the European Union, innovative medicinal products, approved on the basis of a complete independent package, generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the European Union until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.

43



Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Products with an orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time “no similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity where an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric trials has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric trials for orphan indications. The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (i) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (ii) either (a) the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) without the benefits derived from orphan status, it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition, or if such a method exists, the product would be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers made available by the European Union and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan medicinal products. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan medicine marketing exclusivity may be revoked only in very select cases, specifically:

● | if it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | with consent from the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pediatric Development
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage product development in areas of unmet medical need (where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the European Union or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation. The PRIME scheme is open to medicines under development and for which the applicant intends to apply for an initial MAA through under the centralized procedure. Applicants will typically be at the exploratory clinical trial phase of development, and will have preliminary clinical evidence in patients to demonstrate the promising activity of the medicine and its potential to address to a significant extent an unmet medical need. In exceptional cases, products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies, if compelling non-clinical data in a relevant model provide early evidence of promising activity, and first in man trials indicate adequate exposure for the desired pharmacotherapeutic effects and tolerability. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Post-Approval Controls
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:

● | The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post- authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety trials. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each European Union Member State and can differ from one country to another.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.

Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In June 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the United Kingdom officially withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or Transition Period, during which European Union rules continued to apply. However, the European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current European Union regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of United Kingdom and European Union pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the United Kingdom has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the United Kingdom will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the MHRA has conducted a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the United Kingdom clinical trials legislation.
Great Britain is no longer covered by the European Union’s procedures for the grant of centralized marketing authorizations (as a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered as a CMS under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate marketing authorization will therefore be required to market drugs in Great Britain. All medicinal products with a valid centralized marketing authorization on January 1, 2021 were automatically converted into Great Britain marketing authorizations (unless the marketing authorization holder opted out of such a conversion). For two years from 1 January 2021, the United Kingdom’s regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, may rely on a decision taking by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. The MHRA also offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland marketing authorization. The 150 day timeline does not, however, include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application. Such issues should be addressed within a 60-day period, although extensions may be granted in exceptional cases.
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the European Union) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of a marketing authorization application for a United Kingdom or Great Britain marketing authorization. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the European Union, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the European Union, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 person in Great Britain).
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurers, and managed healthcare organizations. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage, and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.

46



Moreover, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover any product candidates we may develop could reduce physician utilization of such product candidates once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time- consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization of the product.
In addition, the U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services; examining the medical necessity of pharmaceutical or biological products; reviewing the cost-effectiveness of such products; and questioning the safety and efficacy of such products. Adoption of new price controls and cost-containment measures, or adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability of manufacturers to sell products profitably. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for such product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS; the civil False Claims Act, or FCA; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA; and similar foreign, federal, and state fraud and abuse, transparency, and privacy laws.
The AKS prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or ordering, of any item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, whether given directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind. The AKS has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, third-party payors, patients, and others on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of an applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the AKS. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim submitted to a federal healthcare program that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim that may result in civil liability under the FCA.

47



Civil and criminal false claims laws, and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the FCA prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product, or for subsidizing copays for patients, including indirectly through charitable patient assistance programs, as an inducement for patients to utilize their products.
HIPAA created additional federal civil and criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA’s fraud and abuse provisions without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, and individuals and entities that provide services on their behalf that involve individually identifiable health information, known as business associates, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can require complex factual and statistical analyses, and may be complicated by the fact that the applicable rules are subject to changing interpretation. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, affected individuals, and if the breach is large enough, the media. In addition to reputational harm, entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing civil actions.
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (currently defined to include doctors of medicine or osteopathy, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other licensed non-physician health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Additionally, we may be subject to federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs and federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.

48



We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws which require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws which require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws which require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we or our officers, directors, employees, contractors, or agents may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties; damages; fines; exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions; entry into a corporate integrity agreement or similar reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance; disgorgement; imprisonment; contractual damages; reputational harm; diminished profits; and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We may also be subject to data privacy and security laws in the United States and various jurisdictions around the world in which we operate or process personally identifiable information (“personal information” or “personal data”). In the United States, even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a). The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA security regulations. In addition, certain states have enacted laws that govern the privacy and security of health information and other personal information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation as well as reputational harm. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, went into effect on January 1, 2023. Also, on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, or the CDPA, became effective. Further, many additional United States state privacy laws will go into effect throughout 2023: the Colorado Privacy Act, or the CPA (July 1, 2023); the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, or the CTDPA (July 1, 2023); and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, or the UCPA (December 31, 2023). The CDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and UCPA are substantially similar in scope and contain many of the same requirements and exceptions as the CCPA, including a general exemption for clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA. Any of these laws may broaden their scope in the future, and similar laws have been proposed on both a federal level and in more than half of the states in the United States. In addition, a number of other states have proposed new privacy laws, some of which are similar to the above discussed recently passed laws. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.
Outside of the United States, we also face stringent privacy and data protection requirements. For example, in the European Economic Area or EEA, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal information including personal health data, is subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European Union, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU.

49



In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.
In addition, various jurisdictions around the world continue to propose new laws that regulate the privacy and/or security of certain types of personal data. Complying with these laws, if enacted, would require significant resources and leave us vulnerable to possible fines, penalties, litigation, and reputational harm if we are unable to comply.
Healthcare Reform and Legislative Changes
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biological products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and expanding enrollment in commercial health plans through new Health Insurance Marketplaces operated by the federal and state governments; a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional, and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal, or repeal and replace, all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, which started on January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, and increasing the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D.
On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order that, in part, instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact our business.
In addition, other legislative and regulatory changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted.
For example:

● | The U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, absent further legislative action.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Right to Try Act (2018), among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50




● | The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it will not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general are not yet known.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, there have been several judicial challenges to the 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities. These include challenges to the government’s reimbursement formula on specified covered outpatient drugs and disputes over potential product diversion through the use of “contract pharmacies,” among other issues. It is unclear how these challenges could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future, if any.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates. Further, on November 20, 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule. 
On November 30, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed, and the IRA extended the moratorium on implementation until January 1, 2032. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.

Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and President Biden have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 107 full-time and part-time employees, of which 74 were located in the United Kingdom, and 33 located in the United States. As of December 31, 2022, 57% of our workforce and 61% of our leadership (at Director level and above) were female. In addition, 27% of our workforce were racially or ethnically diverse. Of our full and part-time employees, 37 have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, and 75 are engaged in research and clinical development activities.
A breakdown of the employment statistics as of December 31, 2022 is as follows:

Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. We engage with our employees in multiple ways including through company-wide events, social events and team events. We also have a bonus scheme and equity incentive plan in which all employees are entitled to participate. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the grant of equity-based compensation awards. We believe that attracting and retaining talent increases shareholder value and furthers the success of our company by motivating our employees to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
We employ individuals based on their experience and ability, and we are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our work environment. We focus on hiring and retaining qualified candidates by promoting a supportive and inclusive working environment for all. We believe that fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion is a key element to discovering, developing, and bringing transformative therapies to patients.
The safety of our workforce, including consultants and visitors to our office/laboratory, has and remained of paramount importance to us. We established a balance of working in both office and home environments prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, which enabled us to more smoothly transition to a consistent “work from home” policy for all but our laboratory employees. An initial risk assessment was performed and applicable precautions were implemented for all staff and visitors. This risk assessment was continuously reviewed to ensure top biosecurity measures were in place throughout this ongoing pandemic. We have not yet experienced any labor force issues due to the pandemic. Work on internal, laboratory-based projects has continued within the agreed timelines.
We have a Health and Safety Committee that focuses on implementing policies and training programs to enhance workplace safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our continuing focus on safe working practices enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our colleagues and workplace visitors safe.

As we continue to grow, we also intend to expand our overall environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, efforts. In 2022, we assigned oversight for ESG to the Nominating and Governance Committee who were tasked with performing an assessment of our ESG impacts and establishing initiatives. Following this assessment, we have created specific goals and objectives to monitor and improve specific metrics. These include:

1. | Environmental – the impact Vaccitech has on the environment, including its assessment of carbon footprint and the reporting thereof for new facilities.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Social – the impact Vaccitech has on society, including the impact on external groups through the development of life-saving products, the impact in low- and middle-income countries and clinical trial diversity. For internal groups the focus is on employees and how Vaccitech monitors and maintains gender pay parity, expands employee diversity, enhances engagement and morale, and minimizes staff turnover.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Corporate Governance – how is the company run, to include diversity and inclusion within the company and the board of directors, board independence and the ratio of executive compensation to employee compensation.

Carbon emissions
The group has calculated the emissions for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (“tCO2e”). The carbon footprint for the group for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------+---+-------------------+---+-------------------+---+-------+---+-------------------+--
​ | | December 31, 2022 | | December 31, 2021 | 
Scope | ​ | tCO2e | | % Total emissions | ​ | tCO2e | | % Total emissions | 
Scope 1 | ​ | 5.59 | ​ | 5 | % | 0.96 | ​ | 5 | %
Scope 2 | | 107.63 | | 95 | % | 20.20 | | 95 | %
Total | | 113.22 | | 100 | % | 21.16 | | 100 | %

​
For clarity, scope 1 emissions are direct emissions produced from activities owned or controlled by the Company. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions related to the generation of the electricity consumed and purchased by Vaccitech. We have used the most recent evidence or estimates provided by our energy supply partners to generate our disclosure of emissions for the period. Standard emissions factors from the “UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (2022)” guidance were applied to estimate emissions. Electricity usage at our leased facilities in the United Kingdom and United States are responsible for the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions, with the remainder due to operations conducted within our laboratory. The increase in emissions is attributable to incurring 12 months of emissions from the acquisition of Avidea in December 2021, which reported negligible emissions in 2021, and the overlap of leased facilities in the U.K. in 2022, notably the fitout and relocation of our corporate headquarters in July 2022, incurring 7 months of emissions across 2 sites in the U.K. Our corporate headquarters moved from a 5,059 square foot facility on the Oxford Science Park to an approximate 31,000 square foot facility on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus. Electricity, heating and cooling usage are the majority of our greenhouse gas emissions in these locations. The group has elected not to include the voluntary disclosure for Scope 3 emissions.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the split of emissions by geography is as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------+---+----------+---+--------+---+-------------------+--
Scope | | Location | | tCO2e | | % Total emissions | 
Scope 1 | ​ | U.K. | ​ | 2.52 | ​ | 2 | %
​ | | U.S. | | 3.07 | | 3 | %
Scope 2 | | U.K. | | 66.22 | | 58 | %
​ | | U.S. | | 41.41 | | 37 | %
Total | ​ | ​ | | 113.22 | ​ | 100 | %

​
The group considers that the intensity ratio of tons of carbon dioxide per full-time employee, as a suitable metric for its operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ 
----------------+---+-------------------+---+-------------------+---+-----------------+---+------------------
​ | | December 31, 2022 | | December 31, 2021
Ratio | ​ | tCO2e /employee | ​ | Average employees | ​ | tCO2e /employee | ​ | Average employees
Intensity ratio | | 1.26 | | 90 | | 0.40 | | 53 

​

53



The tons of carbon dioxide per employee has increased year on year, primarily as a result of an increase in the size of our leased facilities in both the UK and the US, and an increase in our average headcount of 70%. Additionally, as we have expanded our facilities, more employees have been able to work from the office and therefore consumed more greenhouse gas emissions than in 2021, when many non-laboratory based employees were still working from home due to space limitations at the prior facilities and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The directors have established that the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee are to have oversight of the assessment and strategy on how to reduce our energy consumption and thereby reducing our carbon footprint.
