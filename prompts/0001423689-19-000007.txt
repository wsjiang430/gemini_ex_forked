Item 1. Business 
AGNC Investment Corp. ("AGNC," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") was organized on January 7, 2008 and commenced operations on May 20, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "AGNC." 
We are internally-managed, and our principal objective is to provide our stockholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns through a combination of monthly dividends and tangible net book value accretion. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. 
We operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable income. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we distribute all our annual taxable income to our stockholders on a timely basis. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.
We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities ("Agency RMBS") on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac," and together with Fannie Mae, the "GSEs"), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"). We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency or in other investments in, or related to, the housing, mortgage or real estate markets.
Investment Strategy
Our investment strategy is designed to:

• | generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through monthly dividend distributions and tangible net book value accretion;


• | manage an investment portfolio consisting primarily of Agency securities;


• | invest a subset of the portfolio in mortgage credit risk-oriented assets;


• | capitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations in the Agency and non-Agency securities market;


• | manage financing, interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks;


• | continue to qualify as a REIT; and


• | remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act").

 Targeted Investments
Agency Securities

• | Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates representing interests in "pools" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect "passed through" to the security holders, after deducting GSE or U.S. Government agency guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), which are structured instruments representing interests in Agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific Agency CMO securities. 


• | To-Be-Announced Forward Contracts ("TBAs"). TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date. 

 2

Non-Agency Securities

• | Credit Risk Transfer Securities ("CRT"). CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third- parties to private investors. Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third-party; rather, "credit risk transfer" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. The reduced amount that issuers are obligated to repay to the security holders offsets the issuer's credit losses on the related pool of loans. 


• | Non-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities ("Non-Agency RMBS"). Non-Agency RMBS are securities backed by residential mortgages, for which payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of RMBS. Non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Residential non-Agency securities are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or nonprime mortgage loans. We may also purchase Agency and non-Agency multifamily securities where the collateral backing the securitization consists of loans for multi-unit housing properties. 


• | Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities ("CMBS"). CMBS are securities that are structured utilizing collateral pools comprised of commercial mortgage loans. CMBS can be structured as pass-through securities, where the cash flows generated by the collateral pool are passed on pro rata to investors after netting servicer or other fees, or where cash flows are distributed to numerous classes of securities following a predetermined waterfall, which may give priority to selected classes while subordinating other classes. We may invest across the capital structure of these securities, and we intend to focus on CMBS where the underlying collateral is secured by commercial properties located within the United States. 

 Active Portfolio Management Strategy
We employ an active management strategy designed to achieve our principal objectives of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns and managing our net book value within reasonable bands. As part of our investment strategy, we use leverage on our investment portfolio to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We invest in securities based on our assessment of the relative risk-return profile of the securities and our ability to effectively hedge a portion of the securities' exposure to market risks. The composition of our portfolio and strategies that we use will vary based on our view of prevailing market conditions and the availability of suitable investment, hedging and funding opportunities. We may experience investment gains or losses when we sell securities that we believe no longer provide attractive risk-adjusted returns or when we believe more attractive alternatives exist elsewhere in the mortgage or mortgage-related securities market. We may also experience gains or losses from our hedging strategies or due to credit losses on non-Agency securities. 
 Financing Strategy
The primary source of financing for our investments is through repurchase agreements. A repurchase (or "repo") agreement transaction acts as a financing arrangement under which we effectively pledge our investment securities as collateral to secure a loan. Our borrowings through repurchase transactions are generally short term and have maturities ranging from one day to one year but may have maturities up to five or more years. Our financing rates typically track one or three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus or minus a fixed spread.
Our leverage depends on market conditions, our assessment of risk and returns and our ability to borrow funds sufficient to fund the acquisition of mortgage securities. We generally expect our leverage to be within six to twelve times the amount of our tangible stockholders' equity. However, under certain market conditions, we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time.
We diversify our funding exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. We had master repurchase agreements with over 40 financial institutions as of December 31, 2018. The terms of our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association ("SIFMA") as to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender may require that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement to address such matters as additional margin maintenance requirements, cross default and other provisions. 
 3

The specific provisions may differ for each lender and certain terms may not be determined until we engage in individual repurchase transactions. 
We finance a portion of our investments through our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC ("BES"). BES is a member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ("FICC") and has direct access to bilateral and triparty repo funding as a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") member broker-dealer. As an eligible institution, BES also raises repo funding through the General Collateral Finance ("GCF") Repo service offered by the FICC, with the FICC acting as the central counterparty, which provides us greater depth and diversity of repurchase agreement funding while also lowering our funding cost, reducing our collateral requirements and limiting our counterparty exposure.
We also effectively finance the acquisition of Agency RMBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions through which we sell a TBA contract for current month settlement and simultaneously purchase a similar TBA contract for a forward settlement date. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. The TBA contract purchased for the forward settlement date is priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for settlement/pair off in the current month. The difference (or discount) is referred to as the "price drop" and is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying Agency RMBS over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost), which is commonly referred to as "dollar roll income." We recognize TBA contracts as derivative instruments on our consolidated financial statements at their net carrying value (fair value less the purchase price to be paid or received under the TBA contract). Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage at risk, we consider both our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financing.
Risk Management Strategy 
We use a variety of strategies to reduce our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks. Our investment strategies are based on our assessment of these risks, the cost of hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a REIT. Our hedging strategies are generally not designed to protect our net book value from "spread risk," which is the risk that the yield differential between our investments and our hedges fluctuates. In addition, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect our net book value against moves in interest rates, we may not hedge certain interest rate, prepayment or extension risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return profile, or if the hedging transaction would negatively impact our REIT status. 

• | Interest Rate Risk. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk with respect to both the fixed income nature of our long-term assets and the short-term, variable rate nature of our financing. A majority of our funding is in the form of repurchase agreements, and, as a result, our financing costs fluctuate based on short-term interest rate indices, such as the U.S. federal funds rate and LIBOR. Our investments are assets that primarily have fixed rates of interest with maturities up to 30 years, and the interest we earn on those assets generally does not move in tandem with the interest that we pay on our repurchase agreements. As such, we may experience reduced income or losses due to adverse interest rate movements. To mitigate a portion of such risk, we utilize hedging techniques to attempt to lock in a portion of the net interest spread between the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our financing costs. We also use certain hedges, such as short U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures positions, to hedge a portion of the price risk associated with our largely fixed-rate asset portfolio due to changes in interest rates. 

Prepayments on residential mortgages generally accelerate when interest rates decrease and slow when interest rates rise, and, as a result, mortgage securities may increase in price more slowly than similar duration bonds, or even fall in value, as interest rates decline. Mortgage securities could also decrease in value more quickly than similar duration bonds as interest rates rise. This is referred to as "negative convexity." To manage our convexity exposure, we monitor the interest rate sensitivity of our assets relative to the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities and interest rate hedge portfolio, referred to as our "duration gap," and we monitor how our convexity and duration gap change if interest rates and prepayment expectations were to increase or decrease. 
The value of our mortgage assets may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the shape of the yield curve or by changes in the market's expectation about future interest rate volatility. We analyze our exposure to non-parallel changes in interest rates and to changes in the market's expectation of future interest rate volatility and attempt to mitigate these risks using interest rate hedges and through asset selection.

• | Prepayment Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments faster than anticipated. Prepayment risk generally increases when interest rates decline, and our financial results could be adversely affected as we may have to reinvest principal repayments at lower yields. 

 4


• | Extension Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to make only scheduled payments on their mortgage loans, we face the risk that a return of capital on our investment will occur slower than anticipated. Extension risk generally increases when interest rates rise and our financial results could be adversely affected as we may have to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to simultaneously reinvest principal repayments into higher yielding securities due to a lack of or slower than anticipated borrower prepayments. 


• | Spread Risk. Because the market spread between the yield on our investments and the yield on benchmark interest rates, such as U.S. Treasury rates and interest rate swap rates, may vary, we are exposed to spread risk. The inherent spread risk associated with our investments and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed"), liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. Our strategies are generally not designed to protect our net book value from spread risk. 


• | Credit Risk. We accept mortgage credit exposure related to our CRT and other non-Agency securities at levels we deem to be prudent within the context of our overall investment strategy. We attempt to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that we believe are appropriate. Additionally, we may attempt to adjust our credit exposure and/or to improve the return profile of our investment portfolio by varying the mix of our Agency and non-Agency mortgage investments and adjusting our duration gap, when we believe credit performance is inversely correlated with changes in interest rates. 

The risk management actions we take may lower our earnings and dividends in the short term to further our objective of maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long term. In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and as a result may be relatively ineffective for smaller interest rate changes. Our projections of exposures to interest rate, prepayment, extension and other risks are also based on models that are dependent on a number of assumptions and inputs, and actual results could differ materially from our projections.
Income from hedging transactions that we enter to manage risk may not constitute qualifying gross income under one or both gross income tests applicable to REITs (see Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements below). Therefore, we may have to limit our use of certain hedging techniques, which could expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear, or implement those hedging techniques through a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). Implementing our hedges through a TRS could increase the cost of our hedging activities because a TRS would be subject to tax on income and gains.
Management Internalization
Prior to July 2016, we were externally managed by AGNC Management, LLC (our "Manager"). In July 2016, we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding membership interests of AGNC Mortgage Management, LLC ("AMM"), the parent company of our Manager, from American Capital Asset Management, LLC ("ACAM"), a wholly owned portfolio company of American Capital, Ltd. AMM is also the parent company of MTGE Management, LLC, which was the external manager of MTGE Investment Corp. ("MTGE") (Nasdaq: MTGE) until the sale of MTGE to a third party in September 2018. 
Prior to our acquisition of AMM and our resulting management internalization, we paid our Manager a management fee equal to 1.25% of our stockholders' equity, as defined in our management agreement, and we were obligated to reimburse our Manager for its expenses incurred directly related to our operations, excluding employment-related expenses. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 56 full-time employees.
Exemption from Regulation under the Investment Company Act 
We conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act. So long as we qualify for this exemption, we will not be subject to leverage and other restrictions imposed on regulated investment companies, which would significantly reduce our ability to use leverage. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in "mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate" or "qualifying real estate interests" ("55% asset test") and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and "real estate-related assets." In satisfying this 55% requirement, based on pronouncements of the SEC staff and in certain instances our own judgment, we treat Agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all the certificates issued by the pool ("whole pool" securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We typically treat "partial pool" and other mortgage securities where we hold less than all the certificates issued by the pool as real estate-related assets.

Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax on our taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all our taxable income to stockholders within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to continually meet requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests. The REIT asset and income tests are significant to our operations as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT. Consequently, we may be required to limit these activities or conduct them through a TRS. We believe that we have been organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
Income Tests
To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis.

1. | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property.


2. | At least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.

Interest income from obligations secured by mortgages on real property (such as Agency and non-Agency MBS) generally constitutes qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above. Interest income from CRT securities may be treated as either qualifying or non-qualifying income for the 75% and 95% gross income tests depending on the tax structure of the CRT. There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs for the 75% gross income test; however, we treat these as qualifying income for this purpose based on an opinion of legal counsel. Income and gains from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred, or to be incurred, to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met. 
Asset Tests 
At the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets.

1. | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of "real estate assets," cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, and, under some circumstances, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans are generally treated as "real estate assets." Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below.


2. | The value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.


3. | We may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% asset test does not apply to "straight debt" having specified characteristics and to certain other securities.


4. | The aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets.


5. | No more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by certain non-mortgage debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs (even though such debt instruments qualify under the 75% asset test).

A failure to satisfy the income or asset tests would not immediately cause us to lose our REIT qualification; rather, we could retain our REIT qualification if we were able to satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines, or, in the case of a failure to satisfy the asset test, eliminate the discrepancy within a 30-day cure period. Please also refer to the "Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT" in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.
Corporate Information 
Our executive offices are located at Two Bethesda Metro Center, 12th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 and our telephone number is (301) 968-9315.

We make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports as well as our Code of Ethics and Conduct on our internet website at www.AGNC.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These reports are also available on the SEC internet website at www.sec.gov. 
Competition 
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring mortgage assets, we compete with mortgage REITs, mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. These entities and others that may be organized in the future may have similar asset acquisition objectives and increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. Additionally, our investment strategy is dependent on the amount of financing available to us in the repurchase agreement market, which may also be impacted by the overall supply of repo funding and competing borrowers. Our investment strategy will be adversely impacted if we are not able to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.
