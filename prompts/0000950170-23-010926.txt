 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 Alpha Teknova, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, Teknova, we, us or our) is a leading producer of critical reagents for the research, discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapies, vaccines, and molecular diagnostics. Our more than 3,000 active customers span the continuum of the life sciences market and include leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, contract development and manufacturing organizations, in vitro diagnostics franchises, and academic and government research institutions. Our Company is built around our knowledge, methods, and know-how in our manufacturing processes, which are highly adaptable and configurable. These proprietary processes enable us to manufacture and deliver high-quality, custom, made-to-order products with short turnaround times and at scale, across all stages of our customers’ product development, including commercialization.
 We have substantial expertise in manufacturing customer-specified formulations and have demonstrated the ability to manufacture and deliver our products to customers quickly. Due to our expertise in raw materials sourcing, chemical formulation, and quality control, developed over more than two decades, we are typically able to move a new custom product into production in a matter of weeks from order receipt. This can allow our customers to receive their products in weeks as compared to months from alternative suppliers operating in traditional production environments. Our processes are designed to handle a diverse array of customer-requested inputs, which may vary by volume, chemical formulation, quality specifications, container types, and transportation requirements, enabling broad use of our products across the life sciences market. Our proprietary capabilities and products underpin the value we provide to customers across their product development and commercialization activities and allow us to scale with our clients as they grow, supporting their need for materials in greater volumes and that meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.
We offer three primary product types: pre-poured media plates for cell growth and cloning; liquid cell culture media and supplements for cellular expansion; and molecular biology reagents for sample manipulation, resuspension, and purification. We typically begin working with customers in the discovery phase of development, in which they use our off-the-shelf (catalog) formulations for initial experimentation. As customers’ product development progresses and they begin to need products with improved performance, in greater volumes, and that meet GMP requirements (see below), they routinely go on to order higher value, custom, and GMP-grade products. We believe the bespoke nature of our portfolio makes us a critical, trusted supplier to our customers.
 
Due to the extensive validation required for these custom products, our customers frequently integrate them as components into the lifecycle of their own products and, we believe, are therefore unlikely to substitute Teknova’s components with alternatives. As a result, our customer relationships typically span many years and help drive

recurring business. Moreover, we are committed to delivering high levels of customer satisfaction through continued investment in our customer service, infrastructure, quality systems, and manufacturing processes. During 2022, we achieved an annual customer retention rate of approximately 96% for customers purchasing more than $10,000 annually, which represented just over 10% of our customer base and approximately 90% of our average annual revenue during that period. We believe the Teknova brand is well established in the life sciences industry as a result of our track record of delivering high quality, custom products and providing superior customer service.
 We participate in multiple market segments because customers use our products across the life sciences, including in high growth areas like cell and gene therapy research, development, and production. The investment capital raised by companies developing and commercializing cell and gene therapies increased from $9.8 billion in 2019 to $19.9 billion in 2020 and then to $23.1 billion in 2021, according to the latest data from Alliance for Regenerative Medicine.
 We believe our prospects for growth will also benefit from developments in other fields, including mRNA vaccines, synthetic biology, and molecular diagnostics and genomics. We believe the key industry factors that will drive our continued growth include:
 ▪the central role that bacterial cell culture plays in producing plasmids, an essential ingredient in cell and gene therapy bioproduction;
 ▪the need for custom reagents for viral purification in the development of gene therapies to increase viral production efficiency, yield, and purity;
 ▪the growing demand for a single, adaptable, end-to-end provider that can offer both research use only (RUO) as well as GMP-grade, custom, made-to-order products with short turnaround times;
 ▪the importance of GMP-grade products in a development and manufacturing process that is subject to complex and stringent regulatory requirements; and
 ▪the demand for suppliers capable of quickly scaling production volumes up and down in response to customer needs.
 We are also engaged in research and development to identify and address customers' unmet needs. During 2022 we launched a new WFI Quality Water product line for the bioprocessing market. We also announced an early access program for two new products in development to streamline downstream gene therapy bioprocessing. We believe our efforts to create and offer new products will help drive continued growth in key segments of the life sciences market.
The nature of many of our products and their uses require that they be manufactured by highly skilled personnel in contamination-controlled environments, following exacting procedures to ensure quality. We manufacture our products at our facilities in Hollister, California, which were purpose-built to address our customers’ needs for custom-made, RUO, or GMP-grade input components.
 Our Portfolio
 Our products are used across all stages of biopharmaceutical and diagnostic development workflows from discovery to commercialization. They include essential formulations for common research applications and highly customized formulations for customer-specific applications in genomics and bioproduction. Our customers also use our GMP-grade products as components in diagnostic kits and in the production of therapeutics.
Product Categories
 We have two primary product categories: Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions. Previously, we had a third product category, Sample Transport, which we ceased producing in 2021. Our products cross all stages of clinical development, from early research through commercialization.
Lab Essentials
 We are a leader in providing highly complex chemical formulations for use in biological research and drug discovery. Our core Lab Essentials products consist of commonly used, catalog solutions and customer-specified formulations. During discovery, our products are used regularly in small, bench-scale experiments. As customers optimize their processes and begin to scale up in volume, they tend to order more custom products. Our Lab Essentials products include essential formulations for common research applications and highly customized formulations for customer-specific applications in fields such as genomics, synthetic biology, and bioproduction. We sometimes refer to our Lab Essentials products as "research use only" or "RUO." For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Lab Essentials business contributed approximately 77% of our total revenue.
Clinical Solutions
 As noted above, in 2017 we achieved ISO 13485:2016 certification, enabling us to meet the Quality System Regulation (QSR) of products for use in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Our Clinical Solutions products are custom products used in the production of protein therapies, gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, and diagnostic kits. We sometimes refer to our Clinical Solutions products as "GMP" or "GMP-grade". Since offering GMP-grade products, we have achieved substantial growth in the number of customers seeking these products annually. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our Clinical Solutions business contributed approximately 20% of our total revenue.
Sample Transport
 In 2020, we developed and commercialized a suite of sample collection and transport reagents to aid in sample processing for COVID-19 testing. Subsequently, demand for COVID-19 testing declined significantly while the market supply of sample transport medium grew. As a result, in 2021, we decided to cease production of transport medium and no longer market those reagents. For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales of Sample Transport products accounted for an insignificant amount of our total revenue.
Product Types
 We have three primary product types: pre-poured media plates for cell growth and cloning; liquid cell culture media and supplements for cellular expansion; and molecular biology reagents for sample manipulation, resuspension, and purification. Within each of the three product types we offer products from each of our two product categories, except pre-poured media plates which are only offered in our Lab Essentials product category.
Pre-poured Media Plates
 We have an extensive selection of standard and specialty pre-poured media plates for a wide variety of applications including bacteria, fungi, and nematode growth. Pre-poured media plates, also referred to as agar plates, are the industry standard for growing microorganisms. The agar contains nutrients for the microorganism to grow and often contains compounds, such as antibiotics, to identify and select for microorganisms of interest. Microbes are spread on agar media to produce colonies, which are identical sets or clones of the original microorganism. The use of media plates is essential in the drug development process as it enables scientists to perform discovery experiments, express proteins, select cells for further expansion, and monitor the sterility of a bioproduction environment. Our ability to manufacture specialty pre-poured media plates across a wide range of formulations and plate formats makes them suitable for the most complex biological experiments and high throughput robotic applications.
Cell Culture Media and Supplements
 Cell culture media and supplements are used to expand, or grow, a particular cell of interest under controlled conditions. Cell culture media is composed of essential nutrients, such as amino acids and carbohydrates, growth factors, and hormones. To maintain the cells in culture, supplements (such as growth factors and sugars) are added to the culture over time. Expansion of cell lines is fundamental to the production of enzymes, antibodies, vaccines, and protein therapeutics. Different cells, based on species of origin or cell type, require different nutrients for efficient growth. The ability to customize cell culture media and supplements for a specific cell line is necessary to optimize bioproduction purity and yield. Given our customers’ desire to optimize cell culture processes early in development, combined with our ability to offer low production volumes for custom formulations, and then to scale production volumes over time, we believe we are a critical supplier for cell culture development and optimization. In addition, we are a leader in the production of bacterial cell culture media and supplements, which are critical inputs into mRNA vaccine and cell and gene therapy production processes.
Molecular Biology Reagents
 Molecular biology reagents are a cornerstone of biological research, molecular diagnostics, drug development, and bioproduction. Molecular biology reagents are used routinely for a wide variety of applications, including, but not limited to: washing samples; resuspending samples; purifying nucleic acids or proteins; analyzing samples, cell lysis, and sample management. Our diverse offering simplifies widely used biological protocols for our customers. As customers begin to scale production volumes and require increased manufacturing precision, customers frequently seek to specify formulations and product packaging requirements—which we specialize in providing—to achieve their goals of increasing product performance and realizing manufacturing efficiencies.
Competitive Strengths
 Expertise in Complex, Custom Chemical Formulation Manufacturing
 We work closely with our customers to provide highly customized formulations across a variety of workflows. Our customers routinely specify the raw material source, chemical composition, packaging, labeling, and quality control specifications required for their desired product. Through two decades of capital investment and process optimization, we have created a production system designed to develop and manufacture customer-specified formulations, which we believe enables us to produce and quality control custom products faster than our competitors. We leverage our proprietary chemical formulation and production expertise, supported by a product database consisting of the formulations of thousands of previously made products. This database, along with our experienced staff, allows us to quickly determine the optimal production process and meet the associated complexity requirements for custom orders. We believe our ability to rapidly customize has contributed significantly to the adoption of our products.
Quality and Regulatory Expertise Drives Deep Customer Relationships
 The life sciences industry is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny in areas such as quality, reliability, and performance. Our customers rely on us to meet these high standards while also facilitating the development of novel, innovative products. During the early stages of product development, we manufacture formulations specified by our customers to aid in the optimization of therapeutic or diagnostic production processes. Our customers frequently validate these custom-made research and GMP-grade components into their production processes, allowing them to remain with us as a supplier as they scale up from research to commercial production. As a result of the extensive validation and regulatory requirements applicable to these therapeutic and diagnostic products, we believe these components are often used for the life of a product, as evidenced by our customer retention rates. We are focused on developing and fostering long-term relationships with our customers, which has resulted in increased purchasing volumes from our customers over time.
Industry-Leading Delivery Time for Custom Products
 Our operations, built upon our proprietary manufacturing processes developed over the past 20 years, enable adaptable, versatile, and rapid production of complex chemical formulations. Our production process is designed to handle diverse inputs in volume and product type, allowing us to deliver custom, made-to-order products for our clients across the life sciences industry. We seek to collaborate with our customers to gain visibility into their product development and purchasing requirements and are positioned to react quickly to meet their needs. Due to our expertise in raw materials sourcing, product creation, chemical formulation, and quality control, we are typically able to move a new custom product into production in a matter of weeks from order receipt. In addition, we can provide custom solutions at low minimum volumes and increase in scale by up to 100-fold within the same production environment. This means our customers can receive their products in weeks rather than months compared to other suppliers operating in traditional production environments. We ship approximately 75% of our custom RUO products less than three weeks from order placement.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, three of our suppliers each made up 10% or more of our total inventory purchases, which suppliers comprised 63% of our total inventory purchases in the aggregate. One supplier, a distributor, accounted for 37% of total inventory purchases and two of our other suppliers accounted for 14% and 12% of total inventory purchases, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three of our suppliers each made up 10% or more of our total inventory purchases, which suppliers comprised 61% of our total inventory purchases in the aggregate. One supplier, a distributor, accounted for 40% of our total inventory purchases and two of our other suppliers accounted for 11% and 10% of total inventory purchases, respectively.

Well-Positioned in Evolving Cell and Gene Therapy Market
 We work closely with our cell and gene therapy customers to provide customized, made-to-order formulations across a variety of workflows. Our products are critical components frequently used in the research and development of cell-and-gene-therapy-derived pharmaceuticals and vaccines. In particular, we are a leading provider of research and GMP-grade bacterial cell culture media and specialized chromatography solutions—reagents required for cell and gene therapies—which we believe positions us especially well to capture share in these growing markets.
 A report commissioned by us predicts that, compared to spending during phase 1 clinical trials, average spend by customers developing cell and gene therapies increases by 1.4 times during phase 2 trials, 3.2 times during phase 3 trials and 29.8 times during commercial production, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Our data shows that in calendar year 2022, of our approximately 100 customers purchasing more than $5,000 annually and active in cell and gene therapy development, 44% of them purchased solely catalog products from us, 41% purchased at least one custom product, and 15% purchased at least one GMP-grade product. We therefore believe our customers will spend more with us over time as cell and gene therapies move through the FDA approval process and they purchase more GMP-grade products. Combined with our existing strengths and planned investments in areas valued by developers of cell and gene therapies, which we discuss elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we therefore aim to significantly increase our overall revenue from sales to customers active in cell and gene therapy in the years ahead.

 Experienced Leadership and Talented Workforce
 Our senior management team has deep experience across the life sciences, diagnostics, and biopharmaceutical market segments. Our senior management team has served in numerous leadership roles at both large, multinational organizations and small growth companies. Our employees provide tailored support, guidance, and service for our customers. We believe the quality of our personnel is critical to our ability to maintain collaborative, long-standing relationships with our customers.
Our Markets
 We participate in multiple market segments, because customers use our products across the life sciences industry, including in high-growth areas like cell and gene therapy research, development, and production. We believe our prospects for growth will also benefit from developments in other fields, including the validation of mRNA vaccines and their possible use in therapies, continued significant investment in synthetic biology, and growing interest in molecular diagnostics and genomics. Within these market segments, we have benefited from and expect to continue to benefit from favorable industry preferences for customized products, high quality, and short turnaround times. The key factors driving the growth in our market opportunity include the expansion of cell and gene therapy, an increase in the use of mRNA vaccines and therapies, and the growing acceptance of molecular diagnostics and genomics.
 The following are some of the other factors benefiting our core markets:
 ▪Favorable Research and Development Funding. Investment in R&D activities in the life sciences sector has grown substantially in the recent past. We expect pharmaceutical companies to continue to outsource R&D activities as they focus on process efficiency. As a supplier of critical reagents that enable the discovery, research, development, and production of biopharmaceutical products such as drug therapies, novel vaccines, and molecular diagnostics, we expect to benefit from investment in R&D over time.
 ▪Development of New Therapeutic and Diagnostic Modalities. Innovation and R&D activity in our addressable markets is driving the development of a plethora of new therapeutic modalities. We expect that some R&D activity previously geared toward COVID-19 has shifted to other vaccines and therapeutic areas.
 ▪Favorable Demographic Trends. We believe the global demand for healthcare is significantly increasing due to factors such as aging populations, better access to healthcare systems and care, and an increased occurrence of chronic illness.
 ▪Global Expansion Opportunities. We expect favorable R&D funding over time, the development of new therapeutic modalities, and favorable demographic trends to occurring globally. We believe this presents attractive future opportunities to expand into markets outside the United States. 
 In addition to our core markets, we believe there are additional factors driving our key growth markets, including:
 Growth in Cell and Gene Therapy
 As a supplier to approximately 100 leading cell and gene therapy organizations, we are well positioned to benefit from the growth in this market through our high quality, custom, and made-to-order products. The investment capital raised by companies developing and commercializing cell and gene therapies increased from $9.8 billion in 2019 to $19.9 billion in 2020 and then to $23.1 billion in 2021, according to the latest data from Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. Factors driving this growth include an increasing incidence of previously untreatable cancer and other chronic diseases, a corresponding rise in the number of clinical trials, and FDA approvals of cell and gene therapy products.
 We support the development of these therapies by providing customer-specified chemical formulations for bioprocessing, scale-up, and commercialization. Our products are used early in the product development cycle. We believe our product portfolio and our expertise in custom formulations allow us to work closely with our customers at the early stages of product development to optimize manufacturing processes for their particular therapies, and then to scale as their production needs evolve. Therefore, we are able to play an integral role in therapeutic development and, ultimately, commercialization. We believe that because our products are often customized for a specific therapy and then validated, it is unlikely these customers would switch suppliers once their therapies enter clinical trials. In addition, we have announced the development of novel products to address certain critical pain points in gene therapy bioproduction. We believe the introduction of novel products such as these will provide additional revenue opportunities and help position us as key partners to customers in the growing cell and gene therapy market.


Increasing Use of mRNA Vaccines and Therapies
 As a leader in bacterial cell culture media and supplements, lysis buffers, and nucleic acid and protein purification reagents, we are a supplier to the mRNA vaccine and therapeutics market and are well positioned to benefit from the increasing use of mRNA vaccines and therapies. We believe the demand for mRNA will continue to increase and therefore drive the need for more customized, research and GMP-grade bacterial cell culture media and associated formulations. The short development timeline and proven effectiveness of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have demonstrated the promise of mRNA therapies. The production process for mRNA requires the use of bacteria for plasmid production and a substantial number of chemical formulations for producing, purifying, and re-suspending nucleic acid sequences.
 Increase in Molecular Diagnostics and Genomics
 According to third-party research, the global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to grow from $14.1 billion in 2020 to $18.0 billion by 2024, while the global genomics market is expected to grow from $23.5 billion in 2021 to $62.9 billion by 2028. We expect this growth to continue to drive demand for our research- and clinical- grade reagents as high growth diagnostics and genomic market leaders use our formulations as critical components in their manufacturing processes and saleable kits. For example, synthetic biology, enzyme, and antibody manufacturers often use our bacterial cell culture media and related cell lysis and purification buffers to produce their cell lines or proteins of interest. A number of our customers in the life science tools and molecular diagnostic market segments, such as spatial transcriptomics, single cell sequencing, and liquid biopsy, use our molecular biology reagents as critical subcomponents in the kits they sell to their end users.
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to provide our customers the products necessary to accelerate their therapeutic and diagnostic development efforts, from basic research to commercialization of therapies that improve human health. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal include:
Increase Integration of Our Products into Our Customers’ Workflows
 Building lasting relationships and embedding our products within our customers’ key workflows are at the core of our strategy. During the early stages of product development, we manufacture formulations specified by our customers to aid in the optimization of therapeutic or diagnostic production processes. Our customers validate these custom-made research and GMP-grade components into their production processes, and because of the extensive validation required for customers' therapeutic and diagnostic products, we believe these components are often used for the life of a product, as evidenced by our customer retention rates. As customers move from catalog to custom and, ultimately, to clinical production, their total expenditure increases. Based on our purchase data from 2022, excluding purchase data relating to sample transport medium, customers who purchased our custom products spent approximately 18 times more on average per account with us than those who solely purchased catalog products. Over the same period, our customers who purchased our GMP-grade products, purchased 156 times more per account with us than those who solely purchased catalog products and approximately 9 times more than those who purchased catalog and custom research-grade products. In 2022, customers who purchased solely catalog products, custom products, and GMP-grade products constituted approximately 90%, 9% and 1%, respectively, of the Company’s total customers during the period. We aim to increase the proportion of our customers purchasing custom products and GMP-grade products by building lasting relationships and embedding our products within our customers’ key workflows as our customers’ product development matures.
Provide Superior Customer Service Through Operational Excellence
 We are committed to providing superior customer service and fulfilling the expectations of our customers by making the investments required to perpetuate our operational excellence. We have extended our rapid custom production capability by further investing in automation, facilities, and infrastructure to substantially increase the manufacturing capacity at our facilities, improve operating efficiency, and reduce delivery time for our custom research and GMP-grade products. We believe these investments position us for future growth by allowing us to

continue to exceed our customers’ expectations in quality and delivery time and enabling us to maintain lasting relationships with our customers as they advance their products through key phases of product development.
 Expand R&D and Commercial Scale to Establish Leadership in High-Growth Market Segments
 Over the past two decades, we focused almost entirely on developing and enhancing the operational and service aspects of our business, with limited investment in our commercial organization and R&D. Beginning in 2021, we implemented a long-term plan of substantial investment in our marketing, sales, new product development, engineering, and technical support capabilities as well as the expansion and automation of manufacturing operations. We believe these investments will enable us to increase awareness of our brand, develop new products and services, attract new customers, and improve operational effectiveness.
 Our initial focus is on the high-growth cell and gene therapy as well as mRNA market segments, building upon our current cell and gene therapy customer base. These segments require short turnaround times for custom-made formulations that scale to production for clinical use. In addition, we have built viral and nucleic acid bioproduction expertise within the Company, and we are developing new potential services and support models for our target customers. We are focused on bringing technologies to market that enable improved processes and efficiencies in gene therapy and nucleic acid bioproduction. Through these efforts, we aim to onboard new cell and gene therapy and well as mRNA therapeutic customers and to support existing customers when they migrate from research- to GMP-grade products.
 Selectively Expand in Geographies with Attractive Growth Potential
 In 2022, we generated more than 96% of our total revenue within the U.S. We believe a substantial opportunity exists to expand our geographic reach into markets outside of the U.S. that offer strong opportunities for growth, including Europe. Based on our knowledge of the industry, we believe the local supply base in Europe is not able to produce customer-specified formulations with the diversity and at the scale necessary to satisfy the corresponding demand, with the short turnaround times customers expect. Therefore, in the medium to long-term, we intend to expand our addressable market and customer base by pursuing opportunities to grow by developing new relationships with entities that can distribute our products in Europe or help us establish manufacturing capabilities or by acquiring existing operating businesses in Europe. We may also explore partnership or acquisition opportunities in our existing and adjacent market segments within the U.S. to add capabilities and to accelerate our entry into new markets and locations domestically.
Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive environment with a diverse base of competitors, many of whom focus on specific regions, customers, and/or segments. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases are also large customers, have greater financial, personnel, R&D, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do. We also compete with other smaller, niche competitors and specialized companies that focus on certain areas of the life sciences market. A portion of our target customers have established, in-house production capabilities to manufacture products that are substantially similar to our products. In-house production may prove to be a less costly or more desirable alternative to purchasing our products due to prior investments in production infrastructure and workforce.
Our Lab Essentials and Clinical Solutions products compete on the basis of delivery time, performance, and quality with products offered by numerous large, established life science companies such as Thermo Fisher, Millipore (Merck KGaA), Cytiva (Danaher), Hardy Diagnostics, and Lonza. We are differentiated by our ability to offer customer-specified RUO and GMP formulations with short turnaround times in volumes and product characteristics matching customer needs, our Teknova brand reputation established over more than 20 years, and our scientific and technical expertise.
Government Regulation
 We market the products we manufacture as ancillary reagents and materials that our customers can use for research purposes or in the further manufacture of their products, which may include therapies, vaccines, and molecular diagnostics. As ancillary reagents and materials, our products are not subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and therefore none of our current products are registered with the FDA. We do not make any claims related to the safety, effectiveness, or diagnostic utility of any of our products because they are not intended for clinical, therapeutic, or diagnostic use.
 At the same time, the quality of our ancillary reagents and materials is critical to our biopharmaceutical and other life sciences customers who are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and by corresponding regulatory authorities in other countries, regarding the conduct of clinical trials and the marketing approval for and commercialization of products for diagnostic and therapeutic uses. The regulatory oversight of our customers necessitates that they impose rigorous quality requirements on us, as their supplier, through supplier qualification processes, quality agreements, and routine customer audits. We therefore choose to maintain a quality system compliant with our customers’ requirements and expectations, including records of our manufacturing, testing, and quality control activities, and we must be able to provide our customers with corresponding records on a periodic basis, upon their request. These customers may seek to requalify us on a regular basis to ensure our quality system, processes, and facilities continue to meet their needs and requirements outlined in relevant customer agreements.
 Because quality is so important to our customers, and because many of them may further process and validate the products they purchase from us, we voluntarily built our quality system to comply with specific sections of the ISO 13485:2016 standards established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). We are certified to manufacture our products in accordance with those standards. We sell products that we manufacture and process with additional, even more exacting quality and validation controls as “Clinical Solutions” or “GMP-grade,” specifically to meet the needs of customers who use our materials in the further manufacture of their diagnostic, vaccine, or therapeutic products.
 Compliance with “Research Use Only” Labeling Guidance
 In November 2013, the FDA issued Final Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only” (RUO/IUO Guidance). The RUO/IUO Guidance, while generally not legally binding, explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the product from FDA regulation or oversight, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical, therapeutic, or diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. We do not market any of our products for use in clinical, therapeutic, or diagnostic settings. We believe that all of the products we label and sell as intended for “Research Use Only” are properly labeled and marketed as such in accordance with the RUO/IUO Guidance. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that any of our products are intended for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, then those products would be considered medical products and would require approval from the FDA prior to their commercialization.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
 We are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. In the conduct of our business, we handle, store and dispose of certain chemicals and biohazardous waste. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Some of these environmental laws and regulations impose “strict liability,” rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination, including remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, us or others or for acts

that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage, and recovery of response costs. Although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under, or from properties owned, leased, or operated by us or on, under, or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigation, remediation, and monitoring requirements under federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations.
 We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted, we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future, or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products and trade secrets, to operate our business without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, and to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights.
 We rely on trade secrets, including know-how, confidential information, unpatented technologies, and other proprietary information, to strengthen or enhance our competitive position, and prevent competitors from reverse engineering or copying our technologies. We maintain, as trade secrets, information relating to our current products and our products currently in development, as well as information related to our business strategy, client lists, and business methods. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to protect. To avoid inadvertent and improper disclosure of trade secrets, and to avoid the risks of former employees using these trade secrets to gain future employment, it is our policy to require employees, consultants, and independent contractors to assign to us all rights to intellectual property they develop in connection with their employment with or services for us. We also protect our existing and developing intellectual property expressly through confidentiality provisions in agreements with third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information, or afford adequate remedies in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets or other intellectual property or proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our trade secrets and other confidential information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors.
 We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives, which may include objectives within and outside of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, these rights may not be respected in the future or may be circumvented or challenged (and potentially invalidated) in a legal proceeding in any jurisdiction where we have intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries may not afford the same protections or assurances to the same extent as the laws in the U.S. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to intellectual property.
 Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 290 employees, of which 285 were full-time and five were part-time. This includes 159 employees in our operations organization, 72 in administrative functions, 32 in sales and marketing and 27 in engineering and research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.


Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and future employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
 Facilities
 Our headquarters are located in Hollister, California, where we lease approximately 235,600 square feet of commercial, office, manufacturing, and warehouse space at eight separate locations in the same vicinity, which we refer to collectively as our Hollister campus. Our Hollister campus includes dedicated space for us to carry out product formulation, dispensing, manufacturing, and packaging of our products. The Hollister campus includes space used for quality control, packaging, and storage of “retains” for quality control purposes and 12,500 square feet of clean room space. Space used to store our finished goods inventory, ship our products, and house our engineering and quality departments is also located at our Hollister campus, along with a receiving warehouse and raw materials storage. Our management offices, R&D/product development team, lab, customer service, and marketing groups are also located at the Hollister campus.
 We also lease approximately 23,400 square feet of warehouse space in Mansfield, Massachusetts under a lease that expires by its terms in August 2024. We lease the warehouse space in Mansfield from Meeches LLC, a company controlled by Ted Davis and Irene Davis, our founders and current directors and greater than five percent stockholders of ours.
We believe that the facilities we currently lease are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, additional space can be acquired or leased to accommodate future growth.
