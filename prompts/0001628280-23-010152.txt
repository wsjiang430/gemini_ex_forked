 Item 1.    Business
A full discussion of the general development of our business and information about our legal predecessor is included in the section entitled “Business” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on April 18, 2022 (the “2021 Annual Report”). The following discussion provides an update to the general development of our business and includes material developments that have occurred since the date the 2021 Annual Report was filed and incorporates by reference the full discussion in the 2021 Annual Report, which is available here.
OUR BUSINESSES
Overview
The terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “its,” “UpHealth,” or the “Company” used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”) refer to UpHealth, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
UpHealth is a healthcare technology and technology-enabled services company with a mission to enable high quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare for all. Our three distinct, yet complementary business platforms—Integrated Care Management, Virtual Care Infrastructure and Services—empower health systems, health plans, employers, and government agencies and ministries to improve patient and provider experience, quality, access, and population health, and to reduce the cost of healthcare and eliminate wasteful spending.
The ability to ingest complex healthcare data and apply health care expertise and insights allows us to serve people, care providers, payors, communities and governments with innovative digital technology products and services to help our customers solve many of the challenges facing healthcare today.
Integrated Care Management combines technology, data, and clinical expertise to empower payors and providers with the guidance and tools they need to improve population health through its SyntraNetTM platform. This platform improves overall health system performance by leveraging distinctive capabilities in data and analytics, health information exchanges, pharmacy care services, health care operations, and population health. Integrated Care Management serves the healthcare marketplace, including payors, providers, governments, and life sciences.
Virtual Care Management leverages digital health tools, technology, data, and analytics to provide telehealth solutions, which use electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration, and virtual care infrastructure solutions to improve access to healthcare and to resolve health disparities across the care continuum. Virtual Care Management serves the healthcare marketplace, including providers, health systems, and government agencies.
Our Services platform provides behavioral health, mental health, and pharmacy services in the United States, which are critically important to managing whole person care and its associated costs. Our Services business serves the healthcare marketplace, including direct patient care, government agencies, and providers.
Completed Business Combinations
On June 9, 2021, UpHealth acquired (a) UpHealth Holdings, Inc. (“UpHealth Holdings”) and its subsidiaries, which became a wholly owned subsidiary, in an exchange of shares of UpHealth common stock for all the shares of UpHealth Holdings’ capital stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition, and (b) Cloudbreak Health, LLC (“Cloudbreak”), which became a wholly owned subsidiary, in an exchange of shares of UpHealth common stock for all of the Cloudbreak membership units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of UpHealth Holdings, certain promissory notes owed by UpHealth Holdings which became due at the closing of the acquisition of UpHealth Holdings were paid in cash, and the remaining promissory notes owed by UpHealth Holdings were assumed. In connection with the closing of the acquisition of Cloudbreak, certain promissory notes owed by Cloudbreak which were due at the closing of the acquisition of Cloudbreak were paid in cash.
Upon completion of the transactions, UpHealth structured its business across three segments: (a) Integrated Care Management—through its subsidiary Thrasys, Inc. (“Thrasys”); (b) Virtual Care Infrastructure—through its subsidiaries Glocal Healthcare Systems Private Limited (“Glocal”) and Cloudbreak; and (c) Services—through its subsidiaries Innovations Group, Inc. (“Innovations Group”), Behavioral Health Services, LLC (“BHS”) and TTC Healthcare, Inc. (“TTC”).

After undergoing a process launched in the second half of 2021 designed to help us determine how to tie the various components of the businesses brought together between November 2020 and June 2021 that we launched in the summer of 2021, in 2022, we turned to transforming our business strategy to create a company that can profitably fulfill our mission as an integrated whole. By considering our previous financial performance, we determined that it was necessary for us to pivot and to focus on fewer investments for growth. As a result, we sought to establish a company that will deliver high-quality, predictable revenue streams, conserve cash and readjust our operating expenses, and improve operational excellence. This led us to make the following decisions with regard to our reporting segments:
•As a result of the previously disclosed ongoing control issues and legal proceedings with Glocal, UpHealth deconsolidated Glocal in July 2022. These issues and disputes are described in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 3, 2022 and November 14, 2022, and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 filed with the SEC on December 29, 2022, as well as in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report. Accordingly, although Glocal is included in the Virtual Care Infrastructure segment operating results for the first six months of 2022, it is not included in the Virtual Care Infrastructure business discussion for the latter six months of 2022. As of March 31, 2023, the operations of Glocal remain deconsolidated from the rest of UpHealth as we continue to pursue all legal recourse against the founders of that business.
•On February 26, 2023, UpHealth Holdings agreed to sell 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Innovations Group to Belmar MidCo, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Belmar”) and a wholly owned subsidiary of Belmar Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, a portfolio company of Webster Capital IV, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated February 26, 2023, by and among UpHealth, UpHealth Holdings, Innovations Group, and Belmar. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to the completion of required regulatory filings. Innovations Group’s financial results are included in the discussion of full year 2022 results for the Services business, as they are considered held-for-sale.
•At the start of 2023, we made the decision to integrate BHS into our legacy TTC operations and wind down our provider practice in Missouri. As such, BHS results for 2022 are included in the full year 2022 results for the Services business. 
Following all of these changes, our reporting structure remains the same. We have three business segments: (a) Integrated Care Management, which has evolved from the legacy Thrasys business; (b) Virtual Care Infrastructure, which uses MarttiTM, a platform developed by the legacy Cloudbreak business; and (c) Services, which is focused on behavioral health services using a platform created by the legacy TTC business.
Going forward, UpHealth will offer patient-centric digital health technologies and technology-enabled services to manage health and behavioral health across our strategic business segments. We are focused on integrating the value streams represented across these three product and service lines, and focusing on building more data and analytics capabilities to complement our technology. Additionally, we are working on a partnership to incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) into our core product offerings. As of December 31, 2022, UpHealth, Inc. served:
•Approximately 9 million lives on its Integrated Care Management platform in California and other states;
•Approximately 3 million lives where we provided telehealth services at over 2,800 U.S. healthcare venues;
•Over 10,000 patients since opening were provided behavioral health services; and
•Over 300,000 lives, and 18,500 prescribers, for whom we filled over 10 million prescriptions at an average of 1,049 prescriptions per day.
Market Opportunity
In December 2022, the World Health Organization Global Report measured the global healthcare market at $9 trillion, including public and private spending and ranging across the spectrum of healthcare services. We believe that this market is broken, fragmented, and in great need of change. According to government data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), national health expenditure in the United States alone was $4.3 trillion in 2021, representing 18.3% of Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”).
The long-standing macro factors that are driving the healthcare landscape today and straining current systems include an increasingly aging population, growing prevalence of chronic illnesses, unsustainable and escalating costs, and inequitable access to care. While these are not novel challenges, they are accelerating rapidly and exacerbating fundamental flaws in an inefficient healthcare system ill-equipped to provide the necessary services for all its constituents.
Table of Contents

We believe there is a heightened demand for digital services that can improve the management of population health and care delivery, eventually leading to the “practice” of digital health. We believe these advancements are leading to a convergence of technology, data, analytics, information, and connectivity to improve health care and health outcomes. 
We are building a sustainable, scalable business that provides digital health technology and technology enabled services that enhance the patient and the provider experience, improve population health, and reduce healthcare costs. We are creating solutions that improve access to high quality, affordable care by connecting stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem with digital tools and workflows. Doing this will position UpHealth as an indispensable partner to payors, providers and patients as they evolve to the practice of digital health.
An additional area of focus for us going forward is data and analytics. The U.S. Healthcare Analytics market is projected to grow from $35 billion in 2022 to $167 billion in 2030. Market growth drivers will include:
•Tech-led, and tech-enabled services will create more value in an otherwise slow-adopting healthcare environment;
•Expansion of labor pool will increase the need for data and analytic tools to drive more efficient workflows;
•Continued move into risk bearing models, across primary care and specialty-focused models;
•Data-focused plays around a (partially) unified patient record will likely see an acceleration; and
•Increased relevance and opportunities in carve outs while near-term importance of proving business model stability and Return on Investment (“ROI”) become more critical.
We currently work with some of the largest payors in the California market where we have implemented Health Information Exchange systems and technology platforms to improve patient engagement in community-based care. The size of the data and analytics market in California alone is projected to grow over 20% per year for the next decade. We currently have over 3 billion unique data points across our 12 million covered lives. Our data includes claims and encounter data, clinical data, social determinants of health data, consumer data and medical care adherence data. We are working to use that data to help our clients make better decisions about their businesses and we intend to use this asset to supplement our technology products and services to create greater value for our clients.
Integrated Care Management
Integrated Care Management is our healthcare technology business that serves organizations that pay for healthcare, including health plans and state, federal and municipal agencies that ensure the people they sponsor receive high-quality care, administered and delivered efficiently and effectively, all while driving health equity so that every individual, family, and community has access to the care they need.
“Integrated care” is the collaboration among health professionals to provide complete treatment to patients and improve overall well-being. Our Integrated Care Management business is powered by the SyntraNetTM technology platform and applications. SyntraNetTM is a configurable integrated health management platform that enables clinical and community-based care teams to share information, coordinate care, manage utilization, and improve health outcomes and costs for individuals and populations—especially individuals with complex medical, behavioral health, and social needs.
SyntraNetTM creates virtual “care communities” – logical networks of organizations, care managers and service providers – that function as an integrated care team to deploy programs to improve health, quality, performance, efficiency, and costs.
Core features of the platform include the ability to:
• Create virtual, cross-sector care communities;
• Integrate and organize information from a wide range of health and social health data sources;
• Gain insight into health, risks, and opportunities with advanced analytics;
• Qualify and enroll groups into programs;
• Coordinate care teams across the continuum of care; and
• Analyze and report on various measures of success.
Our Integrated Care Management platform provides health plans and provider groups the ability to manage health with new value-based models of care. Our clients include the largest public health plan in the United States, entities that are part of the nation’s most comprehensive “whole person care” initiatives, and one of the fastest growing value-based pharmacy benefit managers.
Integrated Care sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, strategic collaborations and external producers in two key areas: payors including health plans and third-party administrators and public entities including state and local health care agencies. Revenue is derived from license fees, recurring subscription fees, and professional services for implementation.

Virtual Care Infrastructure
Virtual Care Infrastructure is a technology and technology-enabled services business that connects healthcare systems with platforms, analytics and services that make clinical and administrative processes simpler and more efficient. Hospital systems, physicians, and patients depend on UpHealth to help them improve performance, reduce costs and advance care quality through technology-enabled services built directly into clinical workflows.
Powered by Martti™, Virtual Care Infrastructure is a provider of unified telehealth solutions and digital health tools aimed at increasing access to healthcare and resolving health disparities across the care continuum. The Virtual Care Infrastructure business segment has one of the largest installed user bases in the nation, performing more than 300,000 encounters per month on over 40,000 video endpoints at over 2,800 healthcare venues in over 250 languages across the United States. Through its integrated telehealth and language access services, the platform serves as the digital front door to in-hospital care. The MarttiTM platform provides digital health infrastructure enabling its partners to implement unique, private-label telehealth strategies customized to their specific needs and markets, with language access built-in. 
In 2022, MarttiTM expanded its operations by leveraging its existing platform to include other telemedicine use cases, such as telestroke, teleneurology, and telepsychiatry. We also launched a home health virtual visit platform enabling healthcare system partners to see their patients remotely on any device, at any time, anywhere the patient may be, and in any language they may speak.
Virtual Care Infrastructures products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force. Virtual Care Infrastructure’s products are also supported and distributed through an array of alliances and business partnerships with other technology vendors, who integrate and interface our products with their applications. Our Virtual Care Infrastructure business offers an expanding suite of telehealth use cases, which are delivered under multi-year contracts that include fixed minimums with upside attributable to usage-based fees. Our client base includes hospitals and health systems, federally qualified healthcare clinics (“FQHCs”), urgent care centers, stand-alone clinics and medical practices.
Services
Our Services platform provides behavioral health and pharmacy services in the United States, which are critically important to managing whole person care and its associated costs. Our comprehensive behavioral health capabilities are powered by UpHealth BehavioralTM and provide evidence-based and tech-enabled behavioral health and substance abuse services via onsite care delivery and telehealth. Our Services platform is working to deliver an increasing volume of services, including telehealth services, to existing customers, as well as clients belonging to the Integrated Care Management and Virtual Care Infrastructure platforms. 
UpHealth BehavioralTM provides comprehensive patient-centered care, addressing the physical, mental, and social well-being of our clients. We engage people in the most appropriate care settings, including clinical sites, out-patient and virtual. UpHealth BehavioralTM delivers behavioral health services; helps patients and providers navigate and address complex, chronic behavioral health needs; offers post-acute care planning services; and serves consumers and care providers through advanced, on-demand digital health technologies, such as telehealth. UpHealth BehavioralTM works directly with consumers, care delivery systems, providers, payors, and public-sector entities to provide high quality, accessible and equitable care with improved health outcomes and reduced total cost of care. 
UpHealth BehavioralTM sells its products primarily through its direct sales force, and strategic collaborations in two key areas: payors including health plans, third-party administrators; and public entities including the U.S. Departments of Veterans Affairs and other federal, state, and local health care agencies.
Our pharmacy business, Innovations Group, is powered by MedQuest Pharmacy, a full-service retail and compounding pharmacy licensed in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that dispenses prescribed medications shipped directly to patients. It is capable of serving as a retail or national fulfillment center. Other services and products are also available, such as lab and testing services, nutritional supplements, and education and training for medical practitioners. 
On February 26, 2023, UpHealth Holdings agreed to sell 100% of the outstanding capital stock of Innovations Group. We expect the sale to close in the second quarter of 2023, subject to the completion of required regulatory filings.
International
We continue to pursue legal actions against the founders of Glocal. We have an experienced leadership team hired and ready to assume leadership of that business should we choose to bring it back following the arbitration process. The international 
Table of Contents

leadership team is currently focused on building out global operations to support our cost containment efforts and they are also working to productize our telehealth offerings for the international market.
UpHealth Innovation Lab
In January 2023, UpHealth created an Innovation Lab tasked with innovating the most market forward solutions, technology and services, to address the needs of the healthcare market. Products that fall under this umbrella include:
•Data & analytics: UpHealth applies predictive and prescriptive analytics to more than 3.1 billion clinical and social health data points to enable us to provide enterprises with deep insights to support sophisticated targeting and intervention strategies. We are creating a state-of-the-art data fabric that simplifies data sharing and ensures data is discoverable across multiple systems. UpHealth’s data and analytics will enable organizations to implement advanced patient risk stratification and prescriptive next-best actions. 
•Digital health: UpHealth’s AI-driven digital health solutions are intended to enhance revenue through hyper-personalized customer experiences and productivity through the automation of re-designed healthcare operations. 
Key Performance Indicators
As a digital health technology and technology enabled services company, we measure several key performance indicators (“KPIs”) across our platform related to adoption and utilization by users. We believe that the following KPIs will impact our ability to improve the health of patients and help to inform how we manage operations:
•Number of lives: Our mission is to transform care delivery and support healthier individuals and communities. We believe that our digital health technology and tech-enabled services support this mission by empowering providers to deliver coordinated, personalized, affordable, and effective care globally to improve health outcomes. The number of lives served by us globally helps us to assess our performance managing that mission as well as our potential impact on the broader healthcare market. As of December 31, 2022, UpHealth, Inc. had approximately 9 million lives served in integrated care management in the United States.
•Number of care venues: We believe that the number of care venues using our platform globally is an indicator of future revenue growth because we derive meaningful revenue from consultation, diagnostic, and medication dispensing fees, as well as device utilization in the care venues we serve. These venues also provide a base footprint into which we can provide other products and services across our platform. A care venue represents a distinct physical location of a medical care site, hospital, or health system. As of December 31, 2022, UpHealth, Inc. had approximately 2,800 distinct care venues globally. 
•Number of encounters: Because our service and utilization revenue will generally increase with the number of consultations, we believe the number of global (domestic and internationally) consultations provides us with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management, and comparison with our past financial performance. We define core consultations as encounters as patients and providers utilizing our core services, including digital encounter teleconsultations and onsite consultations. UpHealth BehavioralTM admitted and treated 1,000 patients during calendar year 2022 and MedQuest Pharmacy filled an average of approximately 1,049 prescriptions per day in 2022. 
We believe our operational performance will drive our financial results, which will be evaluated at the corporate and segment level. The key financial metrics to which we manage our business include revenues, gross margin, and adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”), which consists of net income (loss) attributable to us, excluding depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation; lease abandonment expenses; goodwill and intangible asset impairments; acquisition, integration, and transformation costs; other income (expense); income tax benefit (expense); income (loss) from equity investment; net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests; and other non-recurring charges to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to us. Other non-recurring charges to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to us may include transaction expenses in connection with capital raising transactions (whether debt, equity or equity-linked) and acquisitions, whether or not consummated, purchase price adjustments, the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles, or other expenses determined to be non-recurring. 
As we expand our role as a partner for key stakeholders in the practice of digital health, we anticipate developing a set of shared performance indicators, such as impact on total cost of care, functional health of members and targeted populations, and satisfaction level of the care experience by providers, customers, and payors.
Business Strategy
Table of Contents

UpHealth is a healthcare technology and technology enabled services company that enables high quality, affordable and accessible healthcare for all. UpHealth has proven solutions with significant revenue and customer momentum, as well as numerous opportunities to achieve synergistic growth. In 2022, we made the decision to transform our business, making hard decisions to focus on those businesses with strong products and customer relationships. We shut down many initiatives that were not producing results and we reduced the size of our workforce accordingly. Finally, we brought in several new leaders to help us drive the business forward.
In 2023, we will focus on executing our One UpHealth strategy and implementing our three-year plan. 2023 will be a year for us to recalibrate the baseline of our business. We will integrate our population health and telehealth technologies, build out our data and analytics services to complement our technology, incorporate AI into our telehealth offering through the creation of virtual agents, leverage our technology to create a tele-behavioral product and build out international operations to support our cost containment ambitions. We created the UpHealth Innovation Lab to accelerate our investments in data analytics and AI and to enhance the UpHealth brand in the marketplace. All of this will help us to make the transition from small, sub-scale businesses to a sustainable, scalable business that delivers value to our customers.
Keys to Our Growth Plan
We bring a set of attributes to the market that we believe will continue to differentiate us across our major stakeholders and end markets. While there have been a number of recent innovations across one-off point solutions aimed at solving specific pain points, we believe they tend to lack a comprehensive approach to addressing broad challenges across the care continuum, and thus fail to fully solve healthcare disparities for all stakeholders. What is required is a combination of innovative technologies and technology-enabled services that are integrated within the workflows and core operating systems of payors, providers, and patients. We believe that the digital health platforms that thrive long term will be those that enable a hybrid model of care delivery, enhancing onsite care settings with an integrated digital infrastructure that provides virtual care access and engagement while also coordinating and connecting both community and clinical care teams within defined populations.
An Integrated Global Digital Health Platform Addressing Critical Market Needs
We operate in the healthcare landscape across three large and high growth digital healthcare markets, providing a comprehensive care hub across multiple care settings. We aim to reshape healthcare delivery through integrated offerings that unite the healthcare ecosystem, enabling the “practice” of digital healthcare (i.e., the use of information and communications technologies in medicine and other health professions to manage illnesses and health risks and to promote wellness). Together, these advancements are leading to a convergence of people, information, technology, and connectivity that improve healthcare and health outcomes through a more coordinated, data-driven, and personalized care experience. We seek to deliver on our vision of providing a guided care experience for patients and providers that is frictionless, engaging, and easy to use.
Growth Levers
Below are the levers through which we believe UpHealth will accelerate growth of the platform:
•Win large, high value deals.  Our Integrated Care Management business, which signs initial multi-year contract terms with recurring revenue, covered 9 million lives in 2022. Our Virtual Care Infrastructure business has signed multiple deals with large hospital systems that give us scale across their facilities. Our behavioral health business is developing a center of excellence model that can be expanded into other states. We must continue to win these large, high value deals to grow our business. We have set a goal of tripling our pipeline in 2023 which will set us up to build and scale our business for growth in 2024.
•Elevate our client engagement.  We have identified thirty-six strategic accounts across our strategic businesses for which we intend to focus on implementing a more robust client engagement model. This will allow us to communicate more effectively the value we are creating for our clients and help us find other channels for growth within the relationships we already have. We are also in the process of expanding self-service analytics for many of our clients, as well as segmented client engagement models that align with client size. These enhancements will drive both client engagement as well as operational efficiencies.
•Expand within our existing strategic clients. UpHealth provides a suite of products across the continuum of care for any entity managing complex patient populations. This enables UpHealth to become a strategic partner for health systems, government entities, and plans, providing services from integrated care management to language translation and interpretation. We are positioned to offer the market a unique, multifaceted and integrated approach to technologies, processes, and services spanning the continuum of care, which creates numerous synergy opportunities across our businesses. As customers use UpHealth’s solutions, the platform will enable them to further utilize the 
Table of Contents

platform’s growing network and dataset to help them provide even better care to a greater population. For example, our operations now have the opportunity to leverage the 2,800+ U.S. healthcare venues that are currently utilizing our telehealth services. Additionally, UpHealth BehavioralTM has expanded into in-patient behavioral health. This is a growing market, growing at 7% annually, offering extensive growth potential in behavioral telehealth which now accounts for 35% of all behavioral health visits, up from low single digits pre-pandemic.
•Grow and diversify our customer base. We have a very strong core of strategic accounts. We are focused on building out our commercial model to help us to grow and diversify our customer base. We will invest in additional resources for sales, marketing, and product development to enable us to communicate our integrated value proposition to payors, providers, and life sciences companies that purchase our solutions. In addition to direct sales, in 2023 we are expanding our presence with channel and strategic referral partners. Our behavioral health team is expanding contracts with payors to increase in-patient volume.
•Lead with innovative Digital Solutions. Our behavioral health platform plans to expand telepsychiatry services in conjunction with Integrated Care by leveraging Martti™ relationships with over 2,800 care venues. Innovative features of our telemedicine digital dispensary and AI-guided, evidence-based care solution will be reengineered to enable introduction into U.S. and other developed international markets. Integrated Virtual Care will continue to roll out specific teleconsultation applications beyond telepsychiatry. Each of these initiatives are expected to provide meaningful revenue opportunities. 
•Scale Prioritized Sectors. We are focused on growing our telehealth, integrated care and behavioral and mental health products and services. Through our UpHealth Innovation Lab, we are adding Data & Analytics as a service through an Analytics cloud based platform to complement our technology products, as all of our prioritized sectors are seeking out these solutions. We will also investigate supplementing our organic growth strategy with select acquisitions to increase market share across our current capabilities, accelerate entry into new capabilities, and expand offerings into new end markets. We plan to leverage our existing capabilities within the three core segments. We will continue to selectively evaluate and, where strategically appropriate, pursue acquisition opportunities that are complementary.
Sales, Marketing and Client Management
We market our products and our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams, which are aligned by business segment and cross-industry domains such as payor, provider and life sciences. Our sales and client management teams operate from the United States and are supported by our business development teams.
Our sales, marketing and business development teams are responsible for new client acquisitions, public relations, relations with outsourcing advisory companies, lead generation, knowledge management, content development, campaign management, digital or web presence, brand awareness and participation in industry forums and conferences. Our professionals generally have significant experience in healthcare, technology, data and analytics, and digital technology within our focus markets.
Clients
UpHealth generated revenues from approximately 400 clients in 2022. Our top three, five and ten clients generated 19.1%, 24.7% and 33.9% of our revenues, respectively, during 2022. Our revenue concentration with our top clients has reduced year-over-year as we continue to develop relationships with new clients to diversify our client base. We believe that the loss of any of our ten largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. 
Competition
As a relatively young health care company, we operate in highly competitive markets across the full expanse of healthcare technology and technology enabled services. The markets in which we participate are highly competitive, with increasing competition from new entrants and expansion by existing competitors. We view our competitors as companies that currently, or in the future will, (i) develop and market digital health technology or (ii) provide telehealth and expert medical services, such as the delivery of on-demand access to healthcare. Competition for developing and marketing digital health technology and the provision of telehealth focuses on, among other factors, technology, breadth and depth of functionality, range of associated care delivery services, operational experience, customer support, size of customer base, and reputation. We compete fundamentally on the quality and value we provide to those we serve which can include elements such as product and service innovation; use of technology; consumer and provider engagement and satisfaction; and sales, marketing and pricing. 
We expect to face intensifying competition from existing competitors in our particular capabilities, platforms looking to broaden their services offerings, and new entrants that introduce digital health services and software platforms or other technology. We currently face competition from a range of point solutions, including specialized software providers that are 
Table of Contents

continuing to more deeply integrate their technology with care delivery services. In addition, large, well-financed healthcare providers have in some cases developed their own telemedicine services and technologies and may provide these solutions to their patients at discounted prices.
We believe that we are uniquely positioned on the basis of these factors and that the offerings of competitors do not comprehensively address the needs of our key stakeholders across our key markets, or fail to do so at scale.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to competition. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Our businesses are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations. Our business, and our customers’ businesses, are regulated by agencies which generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. U.S. federal and state and international governments continue to consider and enact various legislative and regulatory proposals which could materially impact certain aspects of the health care system. New laws, regulations and rules, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and rules, including as a result of changes in the political environment, could adversely affect our businesses. 
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks related to our compliance with U.S. federal and state and international laws and regulations.
U.S. Federal and State Laws and Regulations
Our existing and planned operations are subject to comprehensive U.S. federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and regulations continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare, data privacy and security, and medical practice laws and regulations. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.
Our businesses are also subject to laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickbacks, false claims, prohibited referrals, inappropriate reduction or limitation of health care services, anti-money laundering, securities and antitrust compliance. 
Privacy, Security and Data Standards Regulations
Certain of our operations are subject to regulation under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”). Federal regulations related to HIPAA contain minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets and for the privacy and security of protected health information. In the conduct of our business, depending on the circumstances, we may act as either a covered entity or a business associate. With our health system clients, and our health plan clients, including affiliated medical groups, which are all regulated as covered entities under HIPAA, we are a business associate. We are also a business associate of our covered entity clients when we are providing technology services to those clients via our telehealth platform. Where we provide behavioral health clinical services, we are the covered entity.
Some of our businesses must comply with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) which regulates matters relating to privacy, security and data standards. HITECH imposes requirements on uses and disclosures of health information; includes contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements; extends parts of HIPAA privacy and security provisions to business associates; adds federal data breach notification requirements for covered entities and business associates and reporting requirements to HHS and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and, in some cases, to the local media; strengthens enforcement and imposes higher financial penalties for HIPAA violations and, in certain cases, imposes criminal penalties for individuals, including employees. 
Telehealth Provider Licensing, Medical Practice, Certification and Related Laws and Guidelines
The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals, and standards, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, the practice of medicine (including the provision 
Table of Contents

of remote care), equipment, personnel, mitigating potential conflicts of interests, operating policies and procedures, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. The application of some of these laws to telehealth is unclear, evolving, and subject to differing interpretation. Many states have specific statutes and regulations addressing provision of medical care via telehealth modalities and requirements that must be met to do so. Generally, the services provided must fall within the scope of practice for the licensed professional per the particular state’s board licensing rules and regulations, the same standard of care needs to be met as required for in-person care, and physicians must obtain informed consent from patients to the care provided and the virtual setting.
Physicians who provide professional medical services to a patient via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice medicine in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems for ensuring that our affiliated physicians are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our clients occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing state licensing requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in licensure actions against the physicians, our services being found to be non-reimbursable by payors, or prior payments being subject to recoupments and can give rise to civil, criminal or administrative penalties.
Generally, physicians providing services through telehealth must also use HIPAA-compliant technology. Certain types of technology, such as audio-video synchronous technology, may be required for compliance with state laws and reimbursement depending on the type of service and the payor.
Pharmacy Laws and Regulations
For the period through the closing of the sale of IGI, we will remain subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation applicable to pharmacy businesses. Pharmacies, pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations governing various aspects of the pharmacy business, including the distribution of drugs; operation of mail order pharmacies; licensure of facilities and professionals, including pharmacists, technicians and other healthcare professionals; packaging, storing, distributing, shipping and tracking of pharmaceuticals; repackaging of drug products; labeling, medication guides, and other consumer disclosures; interactions with prescribing professionals; compounding of prescription medications; counseling of patients; prescription transfers; advertisement of prescription products and pharmacy services; security; controlled substance inventory control and recordkeeping; and reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) , state boards of pharmacy, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other state enforcement or regulatory agencies. Many states have laws and regulations requiring out-of-state mail-order pharmacies to register with that state’s board of pharmacy. In addition, the FDA inspects facilities in connection with procedures to effect recalls of prescription drugs. The Federal Trade Commission also has requirements for mail-order sellers of goods. The United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) has statutory authority to restrict the transmission of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that may have an adverse effect on our mail-order operations. The USPS historically has exercised this statutory authority only with respect to controlled substances. If the USPS restricts our ability to deliver drugs through the mail, alternative means of delivery are available to us. However, alternative means of delivery could be significantly more expensive. The Department of Transportation has regulatory authority to impose restrictions on drugs inserted into the stream of commerce. These regulations generally do not apply to the USPS and its operations.
Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws in the U.S.; Fee Splitting
The companies that are part of UpHealth contract with physicians or physician-owned professional associations and professional corporations to provide them and their patients with access to our platform. These contractual relationships are subject to various state laws that prohibit fee splitting or the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and that are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a physician’s professional judgment. Activities other than those directly related to the delivery of healthcare may be considered an element of the practice of medicine in many states. Under the corporate practice of medicine restrictions of certain states, decisions and activities that may be performed by unlicensed individuals or entities and perceived as impacting the clinical decision-making of licensed professionals such as scheduling, policy and procedure development, contracting, setting rates and the hiring and management of clinical personnel may implicate the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine. Similarly, certain compensation arrangements between licensed professionals and unlicensed individuals and entities can implicate state fee-splitting prohibitions, which prohibit providers from sharing a portion of their professional fees collected with third parties.
State corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting laws and rules vary from state to state and are not always consistent across states. In addition, these requirements are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. Some of these requirements may apply to us even if we do not have a physical presence in the state, based solely on our engagement of a provider licensed in the state or the provision of telehealth to a resident of the state. Thus, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our providers, may assert that, despite these arrangements, we are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that our contractual arrangements with affiliated physician groups constitute unlawful fee splitting. In such event, failure to comply could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our affiliated providers, civil, criminal or

administrative penalties, receipt of cease and desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, the need to make changes to the terms of engagement of our providers that interfere with our business, and other materially adverse consequences.
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
Federal Stark Law
We are subject to the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” such as laboratory and radiology services that are furnished at an entity if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” (including an ownership interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (described below). The statute also provides for a penalty for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of various healthcare fraud and abuse statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is a broadly worded, intent-based federal criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, provision, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs or (ii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if “one purpose” of a payment is to induce referrals. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation, making it easier for the government to prove that a defendant had the requisite state of mind or “scienter” required for a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines and imprisonment. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute that protect certain common industry practices from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn, and arrangements may be subject to scrutiny or penalty if they do not fully satisfy all elements of an available exception or safe harbor. However, the failure of a financial relationship to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute.
Although we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources comply with current law and available interpretative guidance, as a practical matter, it is not always possible to structure our arrangements so as to fall squarely within an available safe harbor. Where that is the case, we cannot guarantee that applicable regulatory authorities will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws, including state anti-kickback laws.
Federal False Claims Act
Both federal and state government agencies have continued civil and criminal enforcement efforts as part of numerous ongoing investigations of healthcare companies and their executives and managers. Although there are a number of civil and criminal statutes that can be applied to healthcare providers, a significant number of these investigations involve the federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to a federal health care program or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an 
Table of Contents

obligation to pay money to the federal government. Federal False Claims Act actions can be initiated not only by the government but also through civil whistleblower or qui tam lawsuits. Penalties for False Claims Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government. A False Claims Act violation may provide the basis for exclusion from federal healthcare programs. There is also the federal criminal False Claims Act, which is similar to the federal civil False Claims Act and imposes criminal liability on those that make or present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
Foreign and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
There are state and foreign law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary by jurisdiction and are enforced by local courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers or to any payor, including to funds paid out of pocket by a patient. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Other Healthcare Laws
HIPAA established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representations, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. This statute could be used by the government to assert criminal liability if a healthcare provider knowingly fails to refund a known overpayment. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with federal healthcare programs.
In addition, the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to the federal healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in the federal healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties of up to $20,866 for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. Although this prohibition applies only to federal health care program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts, and statutory or common law fraud.
International Regulation
Our international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate governance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in May 2018 across the EU, which would be applicable if we expand our operations into the EU), data mining, data transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures; required localization of records and funds; and limitations on dividends and repatriation of capital. In addition, the expansion of our operations into foreign countries increases our exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign laws, including the UK Bribery Act.
The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. We also are subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the 
Table of Contents

jurisdictions in which we operate. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and the DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United Kingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. We have internal control policies and procedures and conduct training and compliance programs for our employees to deter prohibited practices. However, if our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions.
We also are subject to regulation by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign countries and regimes, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers, those engaged in activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and other threats to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. In addition, we may be subject to similar regulations in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate.
The healthcare industry in India is subject to laws, rules and regulations in the regions where we conduct our business or in which we intend to expand our operations. Given our digital health centers are situated at multiple locations, we are subject to various and extensive local law, rules and regulations relating, among other things, to the setting up and operation of private medical care establishments. Health and safety laws and regulations in India are becoming increasingly stringent in recent years, and it is possible that they will become significantly more stringent in the future. India is also in the process of and has certain legislation pending regarding increased data privacy.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
We rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.
We have obtained trademark registration for the UpHealth name and logo. We own registrations for certain of our other trademarks in the United States and abroad. Unless otherwise noted, trademarks appearing in this report are trademarks owned by us. We disclaim any proprietary interest in the marks and names of others.
We own and use trademarks and service marks on or in connection with our services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in several jurisdictions. In addition, we rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties and on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. These licenses are standard licenses for common, easily replaceable commercial infrastructure. We require our employees, consultants and certain of our contractors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business. 
No subsidiaries have any existing or planned patents. We may continue to submit patent applications for new inventions and ideas we develop as well as monitor competitors in an effort to protect our intellectual property.
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to intellectual property arising in the ordinary course of our business, including opposition to our applications for patents, trademarks or copyrights, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights, and claims of intellectual property infringement. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Except as set forth in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to legal proceedings.
