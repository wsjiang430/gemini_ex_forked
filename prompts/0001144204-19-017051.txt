Item 1. Business
Background
 
We were organized as a New York corporation in January 2016 under the name HML Capital Corp. On December 15, 2016, we changed our name to Sachem Capital Corp. Prior to February 8, 2017, our business operated as a Connecticut limited liability company under the name Sachem Capital Partners, LLC (“SCP”). On February 9, 2017, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in which we issued and sold 2.6 million of our common shares, $.001 par value per share (“Common Shares”). We believe that since the consummation of the IPO, we have qualified as a REIT and that it is in the best interests of our shareholders that we operate as a REIT. Beginning with our 2017 tax year, we elected to be taxed as a REIT. As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders on an annual basis. To the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders (but more than 90%) we will maintain our REIT status, but the undistributed portion will be subject to regular corporate income taxes. As a REIT, we are also subject to federal excise taxes and minimum state taxes. Finally, we intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act.
Company Overview
 
We are a Connecticut-based real estate finance company that specializes in originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing a portfolio of short-term (i.e. three years or less) loans secured by first mortgage liens on real property located primarily in Connecticut. Each loan is also personally guaranteed by the principal(s) of the borrower, which guaranty is typically collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower. Our typical borrower is a real estate investor who will use the proceeds to fund its acquisition, renovation, rehabilitation, development and/or improvement of residential or commercial properties located primarily in Connecticut held for investment or sale. The property may or may not be income producing. We do not lend to owner-occupants. Our loans are referred to in the real estate finance industry as “hard money loans” primarily because they are secured by “hard” (i.e. real estate) assets.
 
Our loans typically have a maximum initial term of one to three years and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.0% to 12.5% per year and a default rate of 18% per year. We usually receive origination fees, or “points,” ranging from 2% to 5% of the original principal amount of the loan as well as other fees relating to underwriting, funding and managing the loan, such as inspection fees. Since we treat an extension or renewal of an existing loan as a new loan, we also receive additional “points” and other loan-related fees in connection with those transactions. Interest is always payable monthly in arrears. As a matter of policy, we do not make any loans if the loan-to value ratio exceeds 70%. In the case of construction loans, the loan-to-value ratio is based on the post-construction value of the property. Under the terms of the Webster Facility (described below), mortgage loans exceeding $250,000 require a third-party to complete an appraisal of the collateral. Failure to obtain such an appraisal would render the loan ineligible for inclusion in the borrowing base. In the case of smaller loans, we rely on readily available market data, including tax assessment rolls, recent sales transactions and brokers to evaluate the value of the collateral. Finally, we have adopted a policy that limits the maximum amount of any loan we fund to a single borrower or a group of affiliated borrowers to 10% of the aggregate amount of our loan portfolio after taking into account the loan under consideration.
 
In February 2017, we sold 2.6 million Common Shares at $5.00 per share, raising $13 million of gross proceeds in the IPO. The net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $11.1 million. The primary purpose of the IPO was to raise additional equity capital to fund mortgage loans and expand our mortgage loan portfolio. The IPO was also intended to diversify our ownership so that we could qualify, for federal income tax purposes, as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. Initially, we used the net proceeds from the IPO to reduce to zero the outstanding balance on our $15 million credit facility with Bankwell Bank (the “Bankwell Credit Line”), which at the time was $10.8 million. Since then our business has grown. As a result, in May 2018 we replaced the Bankwell Credit Line with the Webster Facility, a $35 million revolving credit facility, described in greater detail below.

In November 2017 we completed a second public offering in which we sold an aggregate of 4,312,500 Common Shares at a public offering price of $4.00 per share. The gross proceeds from this offering were $17.25 million and the net proceeds were approximately $15.3 million, which were also used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Bankwell Credit Line.
 
On May 11, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with Webster Business Credit Corporation (“WBCC”), Bankwell Bank and Berkshire Bank (collectively, the “Lenders”) under which the Lenders agreed to provide us with a $35 million revolving credit facility (the “Webster Facility”) to replace the Bankwell Credit Line, which was repaid in full and terminated. The Webster Facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all our assets, including our mortgage loan portfolio. Amounts outstanding under the Webster Facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 4.00% per annum and will be due and payable on May 11, 2022. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance on the Webster Facility was accruing interest at the rate of 6.50% per annum.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the Webster Facility, we may draw up to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of our “Eligible Mortgage Loans,” which are defined as mortgage loans secured by a first mortgage lien on real property that meet the following criteria: (a) certain representations and warranties are correct; (b) the loan-to-value ratio is not greater than seventy percent (70%); (c) the principal amount of such mortgage loan does not exceed $1.5 million ($4 million in the case of related borrowers); (d) (i) with respect to mortgage loans made prior to the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed thirty-six (36) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond thirty-six (36) months from the original due date of such mortgage note and (ii) with respect to Mortgage Loans made on or after the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed twenty-four (24) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond twenty-four (24) months from the original due date of such mortgage note; (e) the mortgage file has been delivered to WBCC, the Agent for the Lenders; and (f) have been approved by Agent in its “permitted discretion” for inclusion as collateral. Mortgage loans secured by non-residential properties are excluded. At the Closing Date, our Eligible Mortgage Loans totaled approximately $43.2 million.
 
Under the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement, we, either directly or through a loan subsidiary, may enter into a separate loan transaction with one or more third party financial institution(s), which is secured by a lien on the mortgage loans in our portfolio that are secured by “commercial” properties.
 
Events of default under the terms of the Webster Facility include: (i) failure to timely pay amounts due; (ii) breach of covenants and other agreements; (iii) material misrepresentations; (iv) bankruptcy or insolvency; (v) failure to deliver reports on time; (vi) change in control or change in management and (vii) material adverse changes to our business.
 
In connection with the Webster Facility we made various representations and warranties, which are typical of transactions of this type including those relating to our authority to enter into the transaction, our organization and qualification, the filing of tax returns and the payment of taxes, the completeness and accuracy of our financial statements, our compliance with laws, rules and regulations relating to our employees, the workplace and the environment, our solvency, our indebtedness and liabilities; our intellectual property; the status of our material agreements, that we are not in default of any material agreements, that we have no labor disputes and our status as a REIT.
 
The Credit and Security Agreement also includes various affirmative, negative and financial covenants typical of transactions of this type. The financial covenants include maintaining (i) a minimum tangible net worth of not less than $52 million, (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25:1 and (iii) a senior funded debt to tangible net worth ratio of not more than 2:1. At December 31, 2018, our “Tangible Net Worth,” was less than $52 million; however, the Lenders waived compliance with this covenant as of that date. Since December 31, 2018, our Tangible Net Worth has increased and we are in compliance with the net worth covenant.
 
We are also obligated to provide the Lenders with various reports and schedules including unaudited quarterly and audited annual financial statements, an annual budget and a borrowing base certificate. If we fail to provide these reports on a timely basis, we are subject to late fees of $150/day/report.

Finally, in addition to interest, we are responsible for the following additional fees: (i) unused line fee of 0.375% per annum, payable quarterly, (ii) the Agent’s fee of 0.25% per annum computed on the actual outstanding balances, payable monthly, (iii) a collateral evaluation fee of $2,500 per month; and (iv) a computer access fee of $150 per month. Other periodic charges include audit fees of $950/day/person, 2-4 times per year.
 
Our principal executive officers are experienced in hard money lending under various economic and market conditions. Our founders and co-chief executive officers, Jeffrey C. Villano and John L. Villano, are responsible for business development as well as underwriting, structuring and servicing the loans in our portfolio. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from banks, brokers, attorneys and web-based advertising. We rely on our own employees, independent legal counsel, and other independent professionals to verify title and ownership, to file liens and to consummate the transactions.
 
Our primary objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to selectively originate loans and carefully manage our loan portfolio in a manner designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that the demand for relatively small real estate loans in Connecticut and neighboring states is significant and growing and that traditional lenders, including banks and other financial institutions that usually serve this market are unable to satisfy this demand. This demand/supply imbalance has created an opportunity for “hard money” real estate lenders like us to selectively originate high-quality first mortgage loans on attractive terms and these conditions, we believe, should persist for several years. We have built our business on a foundation of intimate knowledge of the Connecticut real estate market, our ability to respond quickly to customer needs and demands and a disciplined underwriting and due diligence culture that focuses primarily on the value of the underlying collateral and that is designed to protect and preserve capital. We believe that our flexibility in terms of meeting the needs of borrowers without compromising our standards on credit risk, our expertise, our intimate knowledge of the real estate market in Connecticut and various other states and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans has defined our success until now and should enable us to continue to achieve our objectives.
 
The Market Opportunity
 
We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a well-capitalized ‘‘hard money’’ lender to originate attractively priced loans to small-scale real estate developers with strong equity positions (i.e., good collateral), particularly in Connecticut where real estate values in many neighborhoods are stable and substandard properties are being improved, rehabilitated and renovated. We also believe these developers would prefer to borrow from us rather than other lending sources because of our flexibility in structuring loans to suit their needs, our lending criteria, which places greater emphasis on the value of the collateral rather than the property cash flow or credit of the borrower, and our ability to close quickly.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
 
Our primary objective is to grow our loan portfolio while protecting and preserving capital in a manner that provides for attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders over the long term principally through dividends. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to focus on selectively originating, managing and servicing a portfolio of first mortgage real estate loans designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. We believe that our ability to react quickly to the needs of borrowers, our flexibility in terms of structuring loans to meet the needs of borrowers, our intimate knowledge of the Connecticut real estate market, our expertise in ‘‘hard money’’ lending and our focus on newly originated first mortgage loans, should enable us to achieve this objective. Nevertheless, we remain flexible to take advantage of other real estate opportunities that may arise from time to time, whether they relate to the mortgage market or to direct or indirect investments in real estate.

Our strategy to achieve our objective includes the following:
 

• | capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market and the continuing lack of liquidity in the commercial and investment real estate markets;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | take advantage of the prevailing economic environment as well as economic, political and social trends that may impact real estate lending currently and in the future, as well as the outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | remain flexible to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operate to qualify as a REIT and for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths include:
 

• | Experienced management team. Our management team, John L. and Jeffrey C. Villano, are experienced real estate lenders. They have successfully originated and serviced a portfolio of real estate mortgage loans generating attractive annual returns under varying economic and real estate market conditions. We believe their experience provides us with the ability to effectively deploy our capital in a manner that will provide for attractive risk-adjusted returns while focusing on capital preservation and protection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Long-standing relationships. At December 31, 2018, 16 loans, having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $5.3 million, were made to borrowers with whom we have long-standing relationships, including three (3) loans with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $879,000 to JJV, LLC (“JJV”) the former managing member of SCP, which is owned by our co-chief executive officers. In addition, our loan portfolio includes 44 loans having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $7.2 million that were extensions of prior loans. Customers are also a referral source for new borrowers. As long as these borrowers remain active real estate investors they provide us with an advantage in securing new business and help us maintain a pipeline to attractive new opportunities that may not be available to many of our competitors or to the general market.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Knowledge of the market. Our intimate knowledge of the Connecticut real estate market enhances our ability to identify attractive opportunities and helps distinguish us from many of our competitors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disciplined lending. We seek to maximize our risk-adjusted returns, and preserve and protect capital, through our disciplined and credit-based approach. We utilize rigorous underwriting and loan closing procedures that include numerous checks and balances to evaluate the risks and merits of each potential transaction. We seek to protect and preserve capital by carefully evaluating the condition of the property, the location of the property, the value of the property and other forms of collateral.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Vertically-integrated loan origination platform. We manage and control the loan process from origination through closing with our own personnel or independent legal counsel and, in the case of larger loans, independent appraisers, with whom we have long-standing relationships. Together, these individuals constitute a team highly experienced in credit evaluation, underwriting and loan structuring. We also believe that our procedures and experience allow us to quickly and efficiently execute opportunities we deem desirable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Structuring flexibility. As a relatively small, non-bank real estate lender, we can move quickly and have much more flexibility than traditional lenders to structure loans to suit the needs of our clients. Our ability to customize financing structures to meet borrowers’ needs is one of our key business strengths.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No legacy issues. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not burdened by distressed legacy real estate assets. We do not have a legacy portfolio of lower-return or problem loans that could potentially dilute the attractive returns we believe are available in the current liquidity-challenged environment and/or distract and monopolize our management team’s time and attention. We do not have any adverse credit exposure to, and we do not anticipate that our performance will be negatively impacted by, previously purchased assets.

• | History of successful operations. We commenced operations as a limited liability company in December 2010 with three investors and limited equity capital. Immediately prior to the IPO, we had approximately 155 investors and $28.5 million of members’ equity, including capital invested by our founders, Jeffrey C. Villano and John L. Villano and their respective affiliates. Our loan portfolio at the time the IPO was consummated was $33.8 million. Since inception our revenues, net income, cash flows and distributions to investors have steadily increased. In 2017, we funded an aggregate of approximately $53.5 million of loans, raised a total of $30.25 million of equity capital (in addition to the $28.5 million of members’ equity immediately prior to the IPO) and obtained a $20.0 million revolving credit facility to support our lending operations. In 2018, we funded an aggregate of approximately $42.1 million of loans, and we replaced the $20.0 million revolving credit facility from Bankwell Bank with a new $35 million revolving credit facility from WBCC to support our lending operations.

Our Real Estate Lending Activities
 
Our real estate lending activities involve originating, underwriting, funding, servicing and managing short-term loans (i.e., loans with an initial term of three years or less), secured by first mortgage liens on real estate property held for investment purposes located primarily in Connecticut. Generally, borrowers use the proceeds from our loans for one of three purposes: (i) to acquire and/or renovate existing residential (single-, two- or three-family) real estate properties; (ii) to acquire vacant real estate and construct residential real properties; and (iii) to purchase and hold income producing properties. Our mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the borrowers. Revenue is generated primarily from the interest borrowers pay on our loans and, to a lesser extent, loan fee income generated on the origination and extension of loans.
 
At December 31, 2018, our mortgage loan portfolio included loans ranging in size from approximately $8,000 to approximately $2.04 million. Approximately 79% of the mortgage loans have an original principal amount of $250,000 or less, with an average mortgage loan size of approximately $196,000 and a median mortgage loan size of approximately $140,000. The table below gives a breakdown of our mortgage loan portfolio by loan size as of December 31, 2018:
 

Amount | Number of Loans | | Aggregate Principal Amount | 
-----------------------+------------------+-----+------------------------------+--
$100,000 or less | | 133 | | $ | 8,862,738 
$100,001 to $250,000 | | 185 | | | 29,318,462
$250,001 to $500,000 | | 67 | | | 23,286,736
$500,001 to $1,000,000 | | 10 | | | 6,472,817 
Over $1,000,000 | | 8 | | | 10,950,357
Total | | 403 | | $ | 78,891,110

 
Most of our loans are funded in full at closing. However, where all or a portion of the loan proceeds are to be used to fund the costs of renovating or constructing improvements on the property, only a portion of the loan may be funded at closing. At December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio included 143 loans with future funding obligations, having a funded principal amount of $30,086,008, and $5,963,355 remained as unfunded pending borrower performance. Advances under construction loans are funded against requests supported by all required documentation (including lien waivers) as and when needed to pay contractors and other costs of construction.
 
In general, our strategy is to service and manage the loans we originate until they are paid. However, there have been a few instances where we have sold loans to meet our need for additional lending capital. Approximately 90% of the loans in our portfolio (representing approximately 89.5% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of our loan portfolio) were secured by properties located in Connecticut at December 31, 2018. The remaining principal balance of our loan portfolio is secured by properties located in Massachusetts, Florida, New York, Vermont and Rhode Island. We are slowly expanding our geographic footprint to include all of New England. Most of the properties we finance are residential investment, or commercial. However, in all instances the properties are held only for investment by the borrowers and may or may not generate cash flow.

The typical terms of our loans are as follows:
 
Principal amount. We have a policy that will limit the amount of any loan to 10% of our total loan portfolio after taking into account the loan in question. At December 31, 2018, our loan portfolio included loans ranging in size from approximately $8,000 to approximately $2.0 million. Approximately 79% of the loans had an original principal amount of $250,000 or less and 96.0% had an original principal amount of $500,000 or less. The average loan size was approximately $196,000 and the median loan size was approximately $140,000.
 
Loan-to-Value Ratio. Under the terms of the Webster Facility, we may draw up to 75% the aggregate principal amount of our “Eligible Mortgage Loans,” which are defined as mortgage loans secured by a first mortgage lien on real property that meet the following criteria: (a) certain representations and warranties are correct; (b) the loan-to-value ratio is not greater than seventy percent (70%); (c) the principal amount of such mortgage loan does not exceed $1.5 million ($4 million in the case of related borrowers); (d) (i) with respect to mortgage loans made prior to the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed thirty-six (36) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond thirty-six (36) months from the original due date of such mortgage note and (ii) with respect to Mortgage Loans made on or after the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed twenty-four (24) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond twenty-four (24) months from the original due date of such mortgage note; (e) the mortgage file has been delivered to WBCC, the Agent for the Lenders; and (f) have been approved by Agent in its “permitted discretion” for inclusion as collateral.
 
Interest rate. Currently, a fixed rate between 5.0% to 12.5% per annum with a default rate of 18% per annum.
 
Origination fees. Ranges from 2% for loans of one year or less to 5% for three-year loans. In the case of three-year loans, a portion of the origination is credited back to the borrower in the event the loan balance is paid off early. In addition, if the term of the loan is extended, additional points are payable upon the extension.
 
Term. Generally, one to three years with early termination in the event of a sale of the property. Recently, in order to mitigate the risks associated with rising interest rates, whenever possible, we seek to limit the term on new loans to one year. We may agree to extend the maturity date so long as the borrower complies with all loan covenants, financial and non-financial, and the loan otherwise satisfies our then existing underwriting criteria. As a matter of policy, we will only extend the maturity for one year at a time, although there is no limit on the number of times the same loan can be extended. However, under the terms of the Webster Facility, a loan whose maturity date has been extended for more than three years from the original maturity date loses its status as an “Eligible Note Receivable.” We treat a renewal or extension of an existing loan as a new loan.
Prepayments. Borrower may prepay the loan at any time without premium or penalty.
 
Covenants. To timely pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and similar charges with respect to the property; to maintain hazard insurance; to maintain and protect the property.
 
Events of default. Include: (i) failure to make payment when due; or (ii) breach of a covenant.
 
Payment terms. Interest only is payable monthly in arrears. Principal is due in a “balloon” payment at the maturity date.
 
Escrow. Generally, none required.
 
Reserves. Generally, none required. However, in some cases, we will require that the buyer prepay certain expenses, such as insurances, taxes and/or interest.
 
Security. Each loan is evidenced by a promissory note, which is secured by a first mortgage lien on real property owned by the borrower and is guaranteed by the principals of the borrower, which guaranty may be collaterally secured by a pledge of the guarantor’s interest in the borrower or other real estate owned by the guarantor.
 
6

 

Fees and Expenses. Borrowers pay an application fee, an inspection fee, wire fee, bounced check fee and, in the case of construction loans, check requisition fee for each draw from the loan. Finally, as is typical in real estate finance transactions, the borrower pays all expenses relating to obtaining the loan including the cost of a property appraisal, the cost of an environmental assessment report, if any, the cost of credit report and all title, recording fees and legal fees.
Operating Data
 
Our lending activities increased each year since we commenced operations. We believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future given the stability of the real estate market in Connecticut and other states in most of the northeast and our reputation among real estate investors as a reliable and reasonable financing source.

The following table details our mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 by year of origination:
 

Year of Origination | Number of Loans | | Aggregate Principal Amount | 
--------------------+-----------------+-----+------------------------------+--
2018 | | 197 | | $ | 35,486,999
2017 | | 109 | | | 27,477,888
2016 | | 54 | | | 8,794,209 
2015 | | 31 | | | 4,539,277 
2014 and prior | | 12 | | | 2,592,737 
Total | | 403 | | $ | 78,891,110

 
Historically, most of our loans are paid prior to their maturity dates. For example, of the loans that were repaid in full during 2018, approximately 81.0% were repaid prior to maturity. Similarly, for 2017, approximately 82.0% of the loans repaid during that year were paid prior to maturity. Our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 included 403 mortgage loans of which 36 (i.e., approximately 9% of the loans in our portfolio) had matured in 2018 but have not been repaid in full or extended. These loans are in the process of modification and will be extended if there are no existing defaults and the borrower can satisfy our other underwriting criteria, including the proper loan-to-value ratio. We treat renewals and extensions of existing loans as new loans.

We monitor our loans on a day-to-day basis. We generate daily reports from our loan tracking software that provides us with detailed information on each loan in our portfolio including the maturity date of the loan, the date the last payment was received, the date the next payment is due, the amount, if any, in arrears, whether we have received any notice from the insurance carrier that a claim has been made or that coverage has been discontinued and whether we have received any notice from the taxing authority of a lien for non-payment of taxes. If there is a default, we immediately contact the borrower to determine the reasons underlying the default and what action the borrower plans to take to cure the default. Once we become aware of the default, we continue to monitor the loan closely until we are satisfied that the situation has been resolved. Generally, we do not make periodic inspections of the properties securing our loans or obtain new appraisals during the term of the loan even if there is a default. However, if the borrower desires to extend the term of the loan, since we treat that as a new loan, we undertake all our underwriting procedures, including, if necessary, a new appraisal.
 
As a real estate finance company, we deal with a variety of default situations, including breaches of covenants, such as the obligation of the borrower to maintain adequate liability insurance on the mortgaged property, to pay the taxes on the property and to make timely payments to us. As such, we may not be aware that a default occurred. As a result, we are unable to quantify the number of loans that may have, at one time or another, been in default. From our inception in December 2010 through December 31, 2018, we have made an aggregate of 885 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal amount of approximately $165.1 million.
 
At December 31, 2018, of the 403 mortgage loans in our portfolio, 13 were treated by us as “non-performing” either because the borrower is more than 90 days in arrears on its interest payment obligation or because the borrower has failed to make timely payments of real estate taxes or insurance premiums. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of these non-performing loans and the accrued but unpaid interest as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $5.1 million. The non-performing loans have all been referred to counsel to commence foreclosure proceedings or to negotiate settlement terms. In the case of each non-performing loan, we believe the value of the collateral exceeds the outstanding balance on the loan.
 
At December 31, 2017, of the 337 mortgage loans in our portfolio, 12 were treated by us as “non-performing” either because the borrower was more than 90 days in arrears on its interest payment obligation or because the borrower has failed to make timely payments of real estate taxes or insurance premiums. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of these non-performing loans and the accrued but unpaid interest as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $2.2 million. The non-performing loans have all been referred to counsel to commence foreclosure proceedings or to negotiate settlement terms. In the case of each non-performing loan, we believe the value of the collateral exceeds the outstanding balance on the loan.
 
Until mid-2015, we did not take an aggressive stance regarding delinquent payments. However, as our business and portfolio grew, we realized late payments were adversely impacting our performance. In addition, late payments were adversely impacting our ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility. Therefore, we decided to be more aggressive in asserting our right to collect late payment fees. As a consequence of our new policy, our revenue from late payment fees increased initially but the number of loans technically in arrears has decreased. Notwithstanding our aggressive stance, we realized that certain borrowers may have difficulty staying current on their obligations. Thus, if a borrower can demonstrate true “hardship”, we will not enforce our rights immediately and give the borrower an opportunity to cure its default. We do not have any specific definitive criteria as to what constitutes hardship or the period we will forbear. Some of the factors we will consider include the nature of the default (i.e., whether nonpayment of amounts due or breach of a covenant or agreement), the reason or reasons for the default, our cash flow requirements, the nature and length of our relationship with the borrower, whether or not the borrower has a history of non-payment and the loan-to-value ratio at the time of the default.
 
At December 31, 2018, five affiliated borrowers accounted for 6.7% of our loan portfolio. At December 31, 2017, four affiliated borrowers accounted for 5.91% of our loan portfolio.

Our Origination Process and Underwriting Criteria
 
Our principal executive officers are experienced in hard money lending under various economic and market conditions. Our co-chief executive officers, Jeffrey C. Villano and John L. Villano, spend a significant portion of their time on business development as well as on underwriting, structuring and servicing each loan in our portfolio. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from existing and former customers and their referral of new business. We also receive leads for new business from banks, brokers, attorneys and web-based advertising.

When underwriting a loan, the primary focus of our analysis is the value of a property. Prior to making a final decision on a loan application we conduct extensive due diligence of the property as well as the borrower and its principals. In terms of the property, we require a third-party appraisal and a third-party assessment report if the original principal amount of the loan exceeds $250,000. In all other cases, we rely on readily available market data such as tax assessments and recent sales. Under the terms of the Webster Facility, mortgage loans exceeding $250,000 require a third-party to complete an appraisal of the collateral. Failure to obtain such an appraisal would render the loan ineligible for inclusion in the borrowing base. We also order title, lien and judgment searches. In most cases, we will also make an on-site visit to evaluate not only the property but the neighborhood in which it is located. Finally, we analyze and assess selected financial and operational data provided by the borrower relating to its operation and maintenance of the property. In terms of the borrower and its principals, we usually obtain third party credit reports from one of the major credit reporting services as well as selected personal financial information provided by the borrower and its principals. We analyze all this information carefully prior to making a final determination. Ultimately, our decision is based primarily on our conclusions regarding the value of the property, which takes into account factors such as the neighborhood in which the property is located, the current use and potential alternative use of the property, current and potential net income from the property, the local market, sales information of comparable properties, existing zoning regulations, the creditworthiness of the borrower and its principals and their experience in real estate ownership, construction, development and management. In conducting due diligence, we rely, in part, on third party professionals and experts including appraisers, engineers, title insurers and attorneys.
 
Before a loan commitment is issued, the loan must be reviewed and approved by our co-chief executive officers. Our loan commitments are generally issued subject to receipt by us of title documentation and title report, in a form satisfactory to us, for the underlying property. We also require a personal guarantee from the principal or principals of the borrower.
 
Our Current Financing Strategies
 
To continue to grow our business, we must increase the size of our loan portfolio, which requires that we raise additional capital either by selling shares of our capital stock or by incurring additional indebtedness. We do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur. Thus, our operating income in the future will depend on how much debt we incur and the spread between our cost of funds and the yield on our loan portfolio. Rising interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business if we cannot increase the rates on our loans to offset the increase in our cost of funds and to satisfy investor demand for yield. In addition, rapidly rising interest rates could have an unsettling effect on real estate values, which could compromise some of our collateral.
 
We do not have any formal policy limiting the amount of indebtedness we may incur. However, under the terms of the Webster Facility, unless otherwise explicitly permitted by the Credit and Security Agreement, we may not incur any additional indebtedness without WBCC’s consent. The most significant exception to this covenant is one that permits us to separately finance the mortgage loans in our portfolio that secure “commercial” properties. Depending on various factors we may, in the future, decide to take on additional debt to expand our mortgage loan origination activities to increase the potential returns to our shareholders. Although we have no pre-set guidelines in terms of leverage ratio, the amount of leverage we will deploy will depend on our assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the liquidity of the real estate market in which most of our collateral is located, employment rates, general economic conditions, the cost of funds relative to the yield curve, the potential for losses and extension risk in our portfolio, the gap between the duration of our assets and liabilities, our opinion regarding the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio, and our outlook for interest rates and property values. At December 31, 2018, debt proceeds represented approximately 34.3% of our total capital. However, to grow the business and satisfy the requirement to pay out 90% of net profits, we expect to increase our level of debt over time to approximately 50% of our total capital. We intend to use leverage for the sole purpose of financing our portfolio and not for speculating on changes in interest rates.
 
On the Closing Date, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement with the Lenders under which the Lenders agreed to provide the Webster Facility to replace the Bankwell Credit Facility, which was repaid in full and terminated. The Webster Facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all our assets, including our mortgage loan portfolio. Amounts outstanding under the Webster Facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 4.00% per annum and will be due and payable on May 11, 2022.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement governing the Webster Facility, we may draw up to 75% of the aggregate principal amount of our “Eligible Mortgage Loans,” which are defined as mortgage loans secured by a first mortgage lien on real property that meet the following criteria: (a) certain representations and warranties are correct, (b) the loan-to-value ratio is not greater than seventy percent (70%), (c) the principal amount of such mortgage loan does not exceed $1.5 million ($4 million in the case of related borrowers), (d) (i) with respect to mortgage loans made prior to the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed thirty-six (36) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond thirty-six (36) months from the original due date of such mortgage note (ii) with respect to Mortgage Loans made on or after the Closing Date, the mortgage note has a stated maturity that does not exceed twenty-four (24) months and does not provide for, or have, any extension beyond twenty-four (24) months from the original due date of such mortgage note and (e) the mortgage file has been delivered to WBCC, the Agent for the Lenders and (f) have been approved by Agent in its “permitted discretion” for inclusion as collateral. Mortgage loans secured by non-residential properties are excluded. At the Closing Date, our Eligible Mortgage Loans totaled approximately $43.2 million.
 
Under the terms of the Credit and Security Agreement, we, either directly or through a loan subsidiary, may enter into a separate loan transaction with one or more third party financial institution(s), which is secured by a lien on the mortgage loans in our portfolio that are secured by “commercial” properties. As of December 31, 2018, mortgage loans secured by commercial properties had an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.2 million.
 
Events of default under the terms of the new credit facility include: (i) failure to timely pay amounts due; (ii) breach of covenants and other agreements; (iii) material misrepresentations; (iv) bankruptcy or insolvency; (v) failure to deliver reports on time; (vi) change in control or change in management; and (vii) material adverse changes to our business.
 
In connection with the new credit facility we made various representations and warranties, which are typical of transactions of this type including those relating to our authority to enter into the transaction, our organization and qualification, the filing of tax returns and the payment of taxes, the completeness and accuracy of our financial statements, our compliance with laws, rules and regulations relating to our employees, the workplace and the environment, our solvency, our indebtedness and liabilities; our intellectual property; the status of our material agreements, that we are not in default of any material agreements, that we have no labor disputes and our status as a REIT.
 
The Credit and Security Agreement also includes affirmative and negative and financial covenants typical of transactions of this type. The financial covenants include maintaining (i) a minimum tangible net worth of not less than $52 million, (ii) a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25:1 and (iii) a senior funded debt to tangible net worth ratio of not more than 2:1. At December 31, 2018 our “Tangible Net Worth,” as defined in the Credit and Security Agreement, was less than $52 million; however, the Lenders waived compliance with this covenant as of that date. As a result of sales of our common shares in the ATM Offering in the first quarter of 2019, our Tangible Net Worth currently exceeds $52 million. We cannot assure you that we will continue to remain in compliance with this covenant or any of the other financial covenants contained in the Credit and Security Agreement. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants in the Credit and Security Agreement, the Lenders could issue a notice of default and, among other things, declare the entire outstanding balance of the Webster Facility immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.
 
We are also obligated to provide the Lenders with various reports and schedules including unaudited quarterly and audited annual financial statements, an annual budget and a borrowing base certificate. If we fail to provide these reports on a timely basis, we are subject to late fees of $150/day/report.
 
Finally, in addition to interest, we are responsible for the following additional fees: (i) unused line fee of 0.375% per annum, payable quarterly, (ii) the Agent’s fee of 0.25% per annum computed on the actual outstanding balances, payable monthly, (iii) a collateral evaluation fee of $2,500 per month; and (iv) a computer access fee of $150 per month. Other periodic charges include audit fees of $950/day/person, 2-4 times per year.

Management
 
Prior to the IPO, our operations were managed by JJV for which it received management fees. During that period, we had no employees and no offices. All our documents and records were maintained by JJV in its offices. All JJV’s activities were conducted by Jeffrey C. Villano and John L. Villano in their capacity as the managers of JJV. Simultaneously, they also engaged in other business activities. John L. Villano had his own private accounting practice and Jeffrey C. Villano owned and managed other properties that had no relationship to us.
 
The management fees payable to JJV in its capacity as the manager of SCP were set forth in the SCP operating agreement and include the following:
 

(a) | 75% of all origination fees and 100% of wire and credit fees paid by a borrower in connection with originating and funding a loan;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | if we purchased an existing loan from a third party, a fee comparable to the origination fee that we would have charged if it had originated such loan;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | a listing fee in connection with the sale of any property that we acquired pursuant to a foreclosure action;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | a monthly servicing fee equal to the sum of (i) one-twelfth of 1% of the total assets of SCP and (ii) one-twelfth of 0.5% to one percent of the total amount of our loan portfolio; and 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(e) | reimbursement of any fees paid in connection with the preparation of all tax returns and audit reports on our behalf.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, JJV had the right to sell any mortgages it held to us at 10% over the principal amount thereof. JJV has never exercised this right.
 
Prior to the IPO, John L. Villano and Jeffrey C. Villano became our full-time employees and senior executive officers. Pursuant to their employment agreements, each of them is required to devote 100% of his time and efforts to our business and have discontinued all other business activities in which he might be engaged even if it does not conflict with our business.
 
Competition
 
The real estate finance market in Connecticut is highly competitive. Our competitors include traditional lending institutions such as regional and local banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other market participants such as specialty finance companies, REITs, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, family offices and high net worth individuals. In addition, we estimate that, in addition to us, there are approximately five “hard money” lenders of significant size serving the Connecticut real estate market. Many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial resources, and access to capital.
 
12

 

Notwithstanding the intense competition and some of our competitive disadvantages, we believe we have carved a niche for ourselves among small real estate developers, owners and contractors throughout Connecticut and the rest of New England as well as in parts of New York State because we are relatively well-capitalized, our ability to structure each loan to suit the needs of each individual borrower and our ability to act quickly. In addition, we believe we have developed a reputation among these borrowers for offering reasonable terms and providing outstanding customer service. We believe our future success will depend on our ability to maintain and capitalize on our existing relationships with borrowers and brokers and to expand our borrower base by continuing to offer attractive loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior service.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We do not engage any third parties for sales and marketing. Rather, we rely on our senior executive officers to generate lending opportunities as well as referrals from existing or former borrowers, brokers, and bankers and web-based advertising. A principal source of new transactions has been repeat business from prior customers and their referral of new leads.
Intellectual Property
 
Our business does not depend on exploiting or leveraging any intellectual property rights. To the extent we own any rights to intellectual property, we rely on a combination of federal, state and common law trademarks, service marks and trade names, copyrights and trade secret protection. We have not registered any trademarks, trade names, service marks or copyrights in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had eleven employees, including our two executive officers, of which nine were full-time.
 
Regulation
 
Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, we may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, referred to herein as the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and ERISA. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third-parties who we do not control.
Regulatory Reform
 
The Dodd-Frank Act, which went into effect on July 21, 2010, is intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal agencies have promulgated, or are in the process of promulgating, regulations with respect to various issues that may affect us. Certain regulations have already been adopted and others remain under consideration by various governmental agencies, in some cases past the deadlines set in the Dodd-Frank Act for adoption. We do not believe any regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act apply to us. However, it is possible that regulations that will be adopted in the future will apply to us or that existing regulations will apply to us as our business evolves.
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities
 
Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, The USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and federal and state securities laws and regulations.

Investment Company Act Exemption
 
Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, we are not currently required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. However, we cannot assure you that our business strategy will not evolve over time in a manner that could subject us to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act.
 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Real estate mortgages are excluded from the term “investment securities.”
 
We rely on the exception set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act which excludes from the definition of investment company “any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses . . . (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” The SEC generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to be available, at least 55% of an entity’s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as “qualifying interests,” and at least another 25% of the entity’s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with no more than 20% of the entity’s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). We believe we qualify for the exemption under this section and our current intention is to continue to focus on originating short term loans secured by first mortgages on real property. However, if, in the future, we do acquire non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets, we may qualify as an “investment company” and be required to register as such under the Investment Company Act, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters.
 
Qualification for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. In addition, complying with the tests for such exclusion could restrict the time at which we can acquire and sell assets.
