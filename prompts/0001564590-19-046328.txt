Item 1. Business. 
 REV is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty vehicles and related aftermarket parts and services. We provide customized vehicle solutions for applications including: essential needs (ambulances, fire apparatus, school buses and municipal transit buses), industrial and commercial (terminal trucks, cut-away buses and sweepers) and consumer leisure (recreational vehicles, referred to as “RVs,” and luxury coaches). Our brand portfolio consists of 29 well-established principal vehicle brands including many of the most recognizable names within our served markets. Several of our brands pioneered their specialty vehicle product categories and date back more than 50 years. We believe that in most of our markets, we hold the first or second market share position and approximately 62% of our net sales during fiscal year 2019 came from products where we believe we hold such share positions.
 The specialty vehicle market is a complex and attractive market characterized by: (i) numerous niche markets with annual sales volumes generally between 3,000 and 25,000 units, (ii) highly customized vehicle configurations addressing unique customer applications and (iii) specialized customer bases and distribution channels (both dealer and direct). We believe the specialty vehicle market has historically been serviced by niche companies, which has created an opportunity for market leadership by efficient producers with the ability to scale resources, such as REV. We believe that our focus on manufacturing best practices and operational improvements, supply chain management, product innovation, and life-cycle value leadership strengthen our market position and ability to compete which provides an opportunity for market growth and margin expansion.
 Our products are sold to municipalities, government agencies, private contractors, consumers and industrial and commercial end users. We have a diverse customer base with our top 10 customers representing approximately 22% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019, with no single customer representing more than 5% of our net sales over the same period. We believe our diverse end markets are favorably exposed to multiple secular growth drivers such as: rising municipal spending, a growing aged population, growing urbanization, growing student populations, the increasing popularity of outdoor and active lifestyles and the replacement of existing in-service vehicles including legislated replacements.
 Our business model utilizes our unique scale to drive profitable organic and acquisitive growth. We seek to gain market share by delivering high-quality products with customized attributes tailored to our customers’ product specifications, while simultaneously reducing costs and shortening delivery lead times. We aim to achieve this by standardizing and optimizing certain processes across our segments via our proprietary REV Production System (RPS) and in areas including: procurement, engineering and product development, lean manufacturing, market analysis, talent management and training, and aftermarket parts sales. We believe our manufacturing and service network, consisting of 20 manufacturing facilities, 8 Regional Technical Centers (“RTCs”) and 4 aftermarket parts warehouses, provides us with a competitive advantage through the sharing of best practices, manufacturing flexibility based on relative facility utilization levels, access to geographically diverse labor pools, delivery costs and lead times, economies of scale, customer service capabilities, and a complementary distribution system. Our business consists primarily of design, engineering, technology application, integration, and assembly activities, which require relatively low levels of capital expenditures. Furthermore, our broad presence across the specialty vehicle market and large manufacturing and distribution network are important differentiators in our ability to grow through acquisitions. We seek to make synergistic acquisitions that further enhance our existing market positions or enter REV into new, attractive product segments. In the past 13 years, we have completed 16 acquisitions. We believe we have the opportunity to grow and enhance the earnings profile of acquired businesses by expanding access to sales distribution channels, consolidating acquired businesses into our existing operations and by introducing RPS and scale into the newly acquired businesses to drive profitable growth.
 To enhance our market-leading positions, we complement growth from strategic acquisitions with iterative product development and new product launches across our three segments. Product development is primarily designed to provide our customers with high-quality products that have varied and unique feature sets and product capabilities at attractive price points. In addition to product development, our businesses are continuously adapting and customizing our vehicles to meet individual customers’ needs and applications. In our RV business specifically, our new model design cycle follows similar timelines as the automotive industry, whereby new models and configurations are introduced or upgraded annually.

Our management team has significant experience in highly specialized industrial manufacturing and aftermarket parts and services businesses. We continue to focus on initiatives to accelerate growth and improve our profitability. These initiatives include: improving brand management, developing new products, strengthening distribution, leveraging a centralized enterprise-wide procurement strategy, growing adjacent and aftermarket products and services, improving production processes within our facilities, driving down total cost of quality, implementing value-based pricing strategies and reducing fixed costs.
 Our fiscal year is from November 1 to October 31, with fiscal quarters ending on the last day of January, April, July and October.
 Our Products and Markets
 We primarily sell new specialty vehicles which we design, engineer and assemble
 in our production facilities. Our aftermarket business consists of parts sales and service. We believe the majority of our new vehicle sales represent the replacement of in-service vehicles which are past their useful life, with additional sales derived from fleet expansions, new customers and new product introductions. 
 Our Fire & Emergency segment sells fire apparatus equipment under the Emergency One (“E-ONE”), Kovatch Mobile Equipment (“KME”) and Ferrara brands and ambulances under the American Emergency Vehicles (“AEV”), Horton Emergency Vehicles (“Horton”), Leader Emergency Vehicles (“Leader”), Marque, McCoy Miller, Road Rescue, Wheeled Coach and Frontline brands. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States and have one of the industry’s broadest portfolios of products including Type I ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a heavy truck-style chassis), Type II ambulances (van conversion ambulance), Type III ambulances (aluminum body mounted on a van-style chassis), pumpers (fire apparatus on a custom or commercial chassis with a water pump and water tank to extinguish fires), ladder trucks (fire apparatus with stainless steel or aluminum ladders), tanker trucks and rescue and other vehicles. Each of our individual brands is distinctly positioned and targets certain price and feature points in the market such that dealers often carry, and customers often buy more than one REV Fire & Emergency product line.

Our Markets
 We operate primarily in the United States in the fire and emergency, commercial and recreation markets, which represented approximately 94% of our overall net sales for fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2019, our net sales to international markets (including Canada) amounted to $140 million, representing approximately 6% of our overall net sales for fiscal year 2019. We sell internationally through dealers and agents to end markets that utilize U.S.-style chassis and product configurations. In December 2017, we established a joint venture with China’s Chery Holding Group in Wuhu to manufacture RVs, ambulances and other specialty vehicles for distribution within China and select international markets. These products will be sold in China and internationally through Chery’s existing distribution network.
Fire and Emergency Markets
 Fire and emergency products are used by municipalities and private contractors to provide essential services such as emergency response, patient transport and fire suppression, among other activities. Nearly all fire apparatus and ambulances are customized in some form; however, they share many common production and component attributes, such as similar manufacturing and engineering processes, raw materials (aluminum, lights, wire harnesses, paint and coatings, among others). The sales prices for our fire and emergency products can vary considerably given their highly customized nature, but generally range from $200,000 to $650,000 for pumper trucks, $500,000 to $1,200,000 for aerial fire trucks and $65,000 to $350,000 for ambulances. Demand is driven primarily by the replacement of in-service fleets, as well as by factors such as a growing aged population and a growing overall population (driving increased patient transportation and emergency response needs), new real estate developments, taller buildings (requiring more aerial vehicles), international airport growth (requiring Federal Aviation Administration-specified ARFF vehicles), and higher municipal funding levels. Local tax revenues are an important source of funding for fire and emergency response departments in addition to Federal grant money and locally raised funding. We estimate that ambulances have useful lives of 5-7 years and generally operate on a 24/7 schedule, driving significant annual mileage which ultimately leads to a replacement sale or remount service as their underlying chassis wears out. We estimate that pumper trucks and aerial fire trucks have useful lives of 10-12 years and 20-30 years, respectively, and that despite operating at a lower level of annual miles driven, these vehicles become obsolete before they mechanically wear out due to technological advances over those time periods.
 We believe that a growing aged population, longer life expectancy, urbanization and the increasing use of emergency vehicles for non-critical care transport are all positive trends for the ambulance market.
 Commercial Markets
 REV’s Commercial segment addresses a broad variety of products and end markets. The transit and shuttle bus markets include applications such as airport car rental and hotel/motel shuttles, paramedical transit vehicles for hospitals and nursing homes, tour and charter operations, daycare and student transportation, and numerous other applications. We believe the commercial bus markets we serve will sustain positive long-term growth supported by growing levels of urbanization which will require increasing commercial bus usage, increased government transportation spending, an aging and growing U.S. population driving demand for shuttle buses, a necessary replacement cycle of public and private bus customers and the introduction of new bus products.
 The demand for school buses is driven by the need for student transportation primarily in the United States and Canada. Within this market, we believe important demand drivers are the increasing number of students, the replacement cycle of in-service vehicles, substitution by private contract companies as the provider of student transportation from school districts (thus requiring the purchase of new buses) and legislated replacements. Insurance providers and state legislatures are increasingly requiring replacement of non-conforming vans which often drives a substitution purchase of our Type A product because of its numerous legislated safety features and benefits versus traditional van products.
 Terminal truck demand is driven by replacement of in-service fleets, growth in trade and the increased use of intermodal freight services and warehouses. We anticipate ongoing growth in global trade will result in higher future intermodal freight traffic growth. Sweeper demand is also driven by replacement of in-service fleets by contractors and rental companies as well as growth in infrastructure and construction spending. Sweepers are used in various applications within the construction and road and highway infrastructure markets.
 The sales prices for our bus and specialty vehicles can vary considerably, but generally range from $45,000 to $80,000 for Type A school buses, $45,000 to $190,000 for shuttle buses, $200,000 to $500,000 for transit buses and $25,000 to $165,000 for other specialty vehicles. We estimate that Type A school buses have useful lives of 8-10 years, that shuttle buses have useful lives of 5-10 years, that transit buses have useful lives of approximately 10-12 years and other specialty vehicles have useful lives of 5-7 years.

Recreation Markets
 The RV industry includes various types and configurations of both motorized and towable RVs of which we currently manufacture and sell Class A (diesel and gas), Class B, Class C motorized RVs and towable campers. Motorized RVs are self-contained units built on motor vehicle chassis with their own lighting, plumbing, heating, cooking, refrigeration, sewage holding and water storage facilities. Class A RVs are generally constructed on purpose-built chassis for reaction travel complete with engine and drivetrain components. We then build the vehicle body, and design, fabricate and install the living area and driver’s compartment of these motorized RVs. Class B RVs are built on a consumer van chassis with the entire living area contained within the existing van frame. Class C RVs are built on consumer truck or van chassis which include an engine, drivetrain and a finished cab section. In Class Cs we design, fabricate and install the living area to connect to the driver’s compartment and the cab section. Super Class C RVs are heavy duty Class C motorhomes built on a commercial truck chassis that can be used in conjunction with other outdoor or sporting activities because of a larger towing capacity.
 Within the Recreation segment, we also design and manufacture a portfolio of towable travel trailers and truck campers under the Lance brand name. These trailers and campers are comprised of a self-contained living area with their own heating, lighting, plumbing, cooking, refrigeration, sleeping and bathroom facilities but excluding a motor vehicle chassis. These products require the RV owner to utilize a motor vehicle to pull or carry them between destinations.
 RVs are a consumer leisure purchase and therefore factors that drive demand include: consumer wealth (including the value of primary housing residences and the stock market level), consumer confidence, availability of financing and levels of disposable income. We believe end customers tend to be brand-loyal and repeat buyers who make decisions based on brand, quality, product configuration (primarily floorplan design, features and product styling), service availability and experience and price. Lifestyle trends are expected to support the growth of the RV market. We believe RVs are becoming more popular through increased interest in nature-based tourism and a growing preference for adventure travel among the growing urban populations. According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association, or RVIA, RV sales will continue to benefit from the aging “baby boomers” as more people enter the primary RV ownership age group of 55 to 70 years old. In 2018, about one million new camper households were added to those who consider themselves annual campers, with an estimated 7 million new camper households in the U.S. since 2014. In addition to the growth tied to aging demographics, there are approximately 45 million active U.S. campers, many of which are outside the aforementioned demographic, representing an opportunity to expand the RV customer base. In any given year, the macro demand drivers of an aging population and popularity of travel will be impacted by the shorter-term cyclical demand swings for RVs that are caused by changes in consumer sentiment due to factors that include consumer wealth, confidence and the availability of financing.
 The sales prices for our RVs can vary considerably, but generally range from $30,000 to $500,000. We estimate that RVs have useful lives of 8-15 years.
 Customers and End Markets
 Our end markets include the municipal market (vehicles for essential services such as emergency response, patient transportation and student transportation), the private contractor market (privately owned fleets that provide transportation services), the c
onsumer market (vehicles for transportation and leisure needs) and the industrial/commercial markets (vehicles for transportation, construction projects and global port and intermodal transportation applications). Based on aggregated available industry data, we estimate that the combined size of our annual addressable markets is approximately 101,000 vehicles.
 Our top 10 customers combined accounted for approximately 22% of our net sales for fiscal year 2019, with no customer representing more than 5% of our net sales in the same period. We and our predecessor and acquired companies have operated in our businesses for many years, and many of our brands have been trusted names in the marketplace for decades. As a result, we benefit from many long-term customer relationships.
 Approximately 48% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 were made directly or indirectly to governmental bodies, including municipalities, such as fire departments, school districts, hospitals and the U.S. federal government. In fiscal year 2019, our approximate direct or indirect net sales by end market was as follows: 48% government, 30% consumer, 10% private contractor and 12% industrial/commercial.
 For fiscal years 2019 and 2018, approximately 97% and 99%, respectively, of our net sales were to customers located in the United States and Canada.

Growth in our end markets are driven by various macro-economic and demographic factors including:
  
• | Population demographics—Overall population growth and the aging population creates greater needs for essential services such as emergency care, healthcare services, transportation and interest in retirement activities including travel and leisure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing state and local government investment—Improving housing prices, improving economies and new housing starts all create an increasing tax base and greater demand for essential services provided by governmental agencies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Replacement demand for essential vehicles—After the 2008 recession the replacement volumes of fire apparatus and ambulances in the United States lagged historical averages that we believe created a higher replacement demand. The annual volume of ambulance sales in the United States reached peak levels starting in fiscal year 2017 before returning to a level that we believe is more in line with normalized replacement demand. Annual sales levels for fire apparatus have not yet reached their previous historical averages, which we believe will create higher demand in the future for the fire apparatus we produce.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Urbanization of the U.S. population—Growing urban population characterized by higher populations and the movement of people to the cities within the United States drives additional construction and housing demand that results in greater need for transportation and emergency services to maintain service and response levels by our end customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing popularity for outdoor lifestyles—There has been a growth of interest in outdoor recreational activities, with RVs providing access to vast and diverse areas. The RV lifestyle and demand for our vehicles is supported by the continued growth in the consumer base which includes increased industry penetration of the baby boomer generation, as well as Generation X, the fastest growing RV owner group as estimated by RVIA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths
 We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 Market Leader Across All Segments with a Large Installed Base— We believe we are a market leader in each of the fire and emergency, commercial and recreation vehicle markets. Approximately 62% of our net sales during fiscal year 2019 are in markets in which we believe we hold the first or second market share positions. We believe we are the largest manufacturer by unit volume of fire and emergency vehicles in the United States. We also believe our Commercial segment is the #2 producer of small- and medium-sized commercial buses as well as Type A school buses in the United States. We believe we are also a leading producer of transit buses, terminal trucks and sweepers. Within our Recreation segment, we are one of the top producers of Class A diesel and gas motorized RVs. We are also a leader in high-end Class B and Super C RVs under the Midwest and Renegade brands. We also believe we have one of the highest quality travel trailer and truck camper product lines under the Lance brand name.
 We estimate that the replacement value of our installed base of approximately 250,000 vehicles across our segments is approximately $36 billion, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage for both replacement unit sales and aftermarket parts, which we estimate to be $830 million of potential sales, and service sales, as brand familiarity drives customer loyalty and fleet owners frequently seek to standardize their in-service fleets through repeat purchases of existing brands and product configurations. For example, one of the largest municipal fire departments in the United States has the vast majority of its fleets of ambulances and fire apparatus standardized on REV branded product configuration and feature sets that satisfy this customer’s unique specifications and standards.
 Broad Product Portfolio and Well-Recognized Brands— Our product portfolio is comprised of high-quality vehicles sold under 29 well-established principal vehicle brands that in many instances pioneered their market segments. For example, we believe the first Type A yellow school bus was developed and sold by Collins Bus and the first Type I ambulance was developed and sold by Horton. We believe our portfolio is comprised of complementary product offerings in adjacent markets and enables us to attract and retain top dealers who in many instances sell multiple REV brands in their territories. Our vehicle platforms are highly customizable and can meet nearly all product specifications demanded by our customers. In each of the markets that we serve, we believe our brands are among the most recognized in the industry, representing performance, quality, reliability, durability, technological leadership and superior customer service.

Selling into Attractive, Growing End Markets— Each of our segments serves end markets that are supported by what we believe to be favorable, long-term demographic, economic and secular trends. We believe that the growing aged population in the United States will increase demand for products across all of our segments, as older demographics are a key demand driver for products such as emergency vehicles and RVs. In the municipal Fire & Emergency segment, increasing legislated changes requiring useful life replacement cycles will create a source of recurring demand for our products as in-service vehicles achieve mileage or age limits. Our Commercial segment is poised to grow as a result of government subsidies for alternative fuel source transportation and increasing urbanization within the United States which is expected to drive greater demand for commercial buses. We believe demand for our school buses and our fire and emergency vehicles will grow with increasing state and local government spending. We also believe our RV segment is poised for long-term industry growth driven by increased interest in camping among older and younger generations and market unit recoveries to historical average levels for certain product categories. Additionally, we believe the current U.S. camper base of 45 million people represents an opportunity to expand the RV customer base. Though our net sales for all the specialty vehicles we manufacture are primarily derived from sales in the United States, similar positive market dynamics exist in other parts of the world, providing an opportunity for future global growth in each of our segments. Only approximately 6% of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 were from sales to customers outside the United States.
 Unique Scale and Business Model— As the only manufacturer of specialty vehicles across all three of our product segments and one of the largest participants in our markets by net sales, we enjoy a unique position relative to many of our competitors that we believe provides a competitive advantage and an enhanced growth profile. Many of our products contain similar purchased components, such as chassis, engines, lighting, wiring and other commodities which increases our leverage with and relevance to key suppliers as compared to our competition. The operational processes across our different products are based on common elements, such as chassis preparation and production, body fabrication, product assembly and painting which allow us to develop best practices across our manufacturing system and implement those processes to drive operational efficiency. Our platform also allows us to leverage the combined engineering resources and product development resources from our broad network to bring new products, features and customer specific customization to market faster. Our business model makes us more desirable to our distribution channel partners as we are able to provide them with a full line of products to address our mutual customers’ needs across a wider variety of price and product feature elements which gives dealers the opportunity to sell to a larger customer base and grow their sales and earnings. Additionally, our scale allows us to more efficiently amortize investments in service locations, parts sales infrastructure and information technology tools, among others.
 Business Model Produces Attractive Financial Characteristics—Our core production processes are design, engineering, component integration and assembly in nature, creating a business model that includes a variable cost structure, low required levels of maintenance capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs. Based on our long-term historical results of operations, we estimate that across all three of our segments, approximately 83% of our cost of goods sold is comprised of direct materials (including chassis) and direct labor, which are typically variable in nature. Because these costs are associated with the specific production of our vehicles in each period, they are typically adjusted within a given period based on production levels in that period. Our remaining cost of goods sold is comprised of certain indirect labor and overhead costs which are fixed or semi-variable in nature because these costs are not linked to specific vehicle volumes in a given period. The time required to adjust these levels of spending is longer and management decisions regarding these costs are typically made based on longer term trends and forecasts. In addition, our selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of salaried payroll expenses which we structure around the level of demand in our markets and based on each business’ sales distribution characteristics. Finally, certain of our businesses carry a relatively long-duration backlog which enables strong visibility into future net sales which can range from two to twelve months depending on the product and market. Where this backlog visibility exists, we are able to more effectively plan and predict our sales and production activity.
 Experienced Consolidator with Proven Ability to Integrate Acquisitions—Over the last 13 years, we have completed 16 acquisitions across our Fire & Emergency, Commercial and Recreation segments and continue to actively consider future potential acquisitions that complement and expand our current product portfolio. Our scale and plant network, strong end market positions, extensive distribution networks, access to low cost capital and reputation as an active and effective strategic acquirer, position us favorably to continue to grow and enhance value through strategic acquisitions. The specialty vehicle market is highly fragmented with a large number of smaller producers, within our existing markets as well as in new markets where we believe there would be synergies with REV. We believe all these attributes position REV as an acquirer of choice in the specialty vehicles market.
Our Growth Strategies
 We plan to continue pursuing several strategies to grow our earnings, expand our market share and further diversify our revenue stream, including:
 12


Drive Margin Expansion Through Controllable Operational Initiatives— We are focused on driving operational improvement initiatives across the organization to increase net income, free cash flow, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA over the long term. We believe we have an improving enterprise-wide culture focused on continuous improvement, implementing measurable performance targets and sharing of best practices across the entire organization. We continuously strive to identify and act on additional profitability improvement initiatives in many of our business units.
 Develop Innovative New Customer Offerings— Due to the specific customer requirements for our products, we are continually enhancing and customizing our product offerings by introducing new features to enhance customer utility across a variety of price points. We seek to expand our addressable market by developing innovative products and services that extend our market leading combination of features, performance, quality and price to new customer bases, new markets or new segments of existing markets. We believe our process of constant innovation will not only help us increase net sales but also achieve lower costs and generate higher margins as our new products are frequently designed to leverage existing procurement relationships and for ease of manufacturability. In addition, there are multiple natural product adjacencies where REV has valuable brand equity, leading technology and cost positions where we believe we can generate strong demand for new products.
 Enhance Sales and Distribution Model— We believe that we are an attractive specialty vehicle OEM partner for dealers due to the breadth and quality of our product offerings, our brand recognition, our ability to produce products at varied price and feature points, as well as our aftermarket support capabilities. We intend to continue to leverage this strength to enhance our distribution network through selectively adding dealers in new territories, strengthening dealers in our existing network and expanding our direct sales and service capabilities in targeted markets. Our goal is to partner with the leading dealers in each market and to provide the necessary resources to ensure our partner dealers can best position REV products to compete successfully within their regions. We will also continue to optimize our go-to-market channel strategy (e.g., distribution or direct sale) based on the specific market dynamics and customer composition by region. We have historically focused on customers within the United States; however, we believe there is demand internationally for our products and may seek to expand our distribution globally.
 Accelerate Aftermarket Growth— Our end users’ large in-service fleets create strong demand for aftermarket parts in order to keep vehicles running and to support their residual value. We have formalized an aftermarket strategy and have created a dedicated management team to oversee our aftermarket business. We have established a web-based technology platform to provide our customers with real time data on parts availability and pricing for each of the vehicles we manufacturer. In 2019, we invested in our aftermarket services network infrastructure with the implementation of Salesforce Service Cloud to automate the management of customer service cases and parts sales on a 1:1 level at scale.
 Pursue Value Enhancing Acquisitions— We seek to pursue acquisitions which enhance our existing market positions, facilitate our entry to new product categories and/or markets and achieve our targeted financial returns. We have a long history of acquisitions with 16 transactions completed over the past 13 years. Given our leadership positions within our markets and our existing facility, service and distribution network, we believe we have many inherent advantages in making acquisitions and have demonstrated the ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions while realizing synergies. We believe that we have a clear acquisition strategy in place, targeting acquisitions with significant synergies to drive long-term value creation for shareholders. We will seek acquisitions of companies with strong brands and complementary products and distribution networks that align well with our aftermarket strategies and provide strong synergies with our existing business. In addition, we will target acquisitions which further diversify or broaden our product offerings and geographic reach, and simultaneously produce attractive financial returns.
Our Initial Public Offering
 On January 26, 2017, we announced the pricing of an initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of our common stock, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on January 27, 2017. On February 1, 2017, we completed the IPO of 12.5 million shares of common stock at a price of $22.00 per share. The Company received $275.0 million in gross proceeds from the IPO, or approximately $253.6 million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses related to the IPO. The net proceeds of the IPO were used to partially pay down the Company’s existing debt. The Company redeemed the entire outstanding balance of its Senior Secured Notes (the “Notes”), including a prepayment premium and accrued interest, plus it partially paid down a portion of the then outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility. Immediately prior to closing of the IPO, the Company completed an 80-for-one stock split of its Class A common stock and Class B common stock and reclassified the Class A common stock and Class B common stock into a single class of common stock, which was the same class as the shares sold in the IPO. 
Our Equity Sponsor
 The Company’s primary equity holders are funds and an investment vehicle associated with AIP CF IV, LLC, which the Company collectively refers to as “American Industrial Partners,” “AIP” or “Sponsor” and which indirectly own approximately 54.3% of REV Group’s voting equity as of October 31, 2019. AIP is an operations and engineering-focused private equity firm headquartered in New York, New York.

Distribution
 We distribute either through our direct sales force or our well-established dealer network, consisting of approximately 500 dealers. Substantially all of our dealers are independently owned. Whether we sell directly to the customer or through a dealer depends largely on the product line, the customer base and applicable regulations. We provide our direct sales force representatives and dealers with training on the operation and specifications of our products. We strive to keep our direct sales force representatives and dealers up to date on our product offerings and new features as well as market trends. We believe our scale enables us to dedicate certain sales and marketing efforts to particular products, customers or geographic regions, which we believe enables us to develop expertise valued by our customers.
 As one of the leaders in each of our markets, we believe our distribution network consists of many of the leading dealers within each segment. We believe our extensive dealer network has the ability to meet the needs of end customers with high to low value-added products, such as vehicles, equipment, components and parts and services, at a variety of price points and order sizes. As a result, most of our dealers have sold our products for over a decade and are serving a well-established installed base of end customers, creating cost advantages and entrenched positions due to customer loyalty. We also periodically assist our dealers in composing bid packages for larger opportunities that involve our product lines. We continue to grow and enhance our distribution network into underserved areas. In addition, we evaluate export opportunities from time to time in select international markets through our direct sales force and our established international dealerships and agents.
 Fire & Emergency Segment
 We sell our ambulances through internal direct sales personnel as well as a select group of independent dealers in the United States. Our direct sales force is responsible for sales to key Accounts that operate in multiple states or require a direct OEM relationship to service their business. Approximately 56 independent dealers provide full coverage of the U.S. domestic market and provide both sales and service to our customers. We believe our dealers hold the leading position in their assigned territories, providing us with a significant competitive advantage. In addition, we participate in Government Services Agency (“GSA”) Schedules Program and we export to most of the international markets that participate in this program. These include countries in the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean basin.
 Our fire apparatus business uses its direct sales force and its dealer network comprised of approximately 70 dealers in the United States and Canada and approximately 25 international dealers to sell its products. We have continued to grow our distribution network into underserved areas. As such, we believe there are significant opportunities to grow our dealer footprint to serve this market. We believe that with our new product and expanding dealer network in this area, we will begin to capture additional market share going forward.
 Commercial Segment
 We utilize dealer distribution in markets where a local, experienced dealer is available to sell and service our vehicles. Selling through a dealer can be more cost effective than utilizing direct sales personnel in some cases. As a result, we continually evaluate potential dealer relationships to determine if the addition of a dealer in a given region would be advantageous to net sales and our market share. In addition to our dealer network, we also utilize direct national accounts, such as transit agencies, school transportation contractors, national childcare providers, hotels, rental car and parking lot operators, nursing and retirement homes and church organizations.
 The Capacity brand utilizes a combination of a direct sales force, international agents and dealers to market its products worldwide. Capacity also utilizes an extensive network of dealers in the United States and Canada.
 The Lay-Mor brand is principally marketed in both commercial and rental markets through the manufacturer’s representatives and distributors who are supported by our internal sales efforts with key customers, such as national equipment rental companies and government agencies. Our direct sales personnel work directly with national customers to ensure that Lay-Mor equipment meets customers’ specifications and is qualified for sale throughout their national network.
 Recreation Segment
 We sell our RV products through a national independent dealer network with internal sales personnel responsible for direct engagement with these dealers. RV purchases are sensitive to wholesale and retail financing, consumer confidence and disposable income, making them discretionary products. The largest RV buying group is people between the ages of 35 and 54, with an average age of all RV owners of 45, according to the RVIA. Many buyers of RVs are brand loyal, repeat purchasers who make decisions based on brand, product configuration (primarily floor plan design, features and product styling), service and price. This buying group is expected to grow as the wealthy baby boomer generation continues to age. For many of these buyers, a motor home purchase is the second biggest purchase in their lifetime; therefore, the shopping timeline is longer than other consumer purchases. The buying process normally starts with online searches, followed by show visits and eventually a dealership visit for the purchase.
 14


Manufacturing and Service Capabilities
 We currently operate 20 manufacturing facilities, 8 RTCs and 4 aftermarket parts warehouses across the United States with approximately 5.7 million square feet of manufacturing and service space. We believe that our factories are among some of the most efficient and lowest cost production facilities in each of our markets due to the production processes that we employ, our purchasing scale and the high unit volume throughput. In addition, approximately 83% of our cost of goods sold are comprised of direct materials (including chassis) and direct labor, which are typically variable in nature. Because these costs are associated with the specific production of our vehicles in each period, they are typically adjusted within a given period based on production levels in that period. Our products within each of our segments and across the enterprise share a centralized sourcing model and employ certain common engineering and manufacturing processes. Through our manufacturing infrastructure, we leverage our capabilities and scale in procurement, new product development, design, assembly and painting processes. We also leverage best practices in quality control and worker safety across our segments.
 We strive to instill a manufacturing culture of continuous improvement through our proprietary RPS and other initiatives. Many of our direct labor employees are taught lean manufacturing principles or other operational best practices to improve the efficiency of their production processes and enhance their employment experience. The commonality and scale of RPS across all of our factories in the areas of chassis production/preparation, product assembly and flow processes and “body” and apparatus design and manufacturing allows us to share efficiency and operational best practices across our segments.
 Our RTC footprint is strategically placed throughout the United States and our locations are staffed with technicians and customer service representatives to support our approximately 250,000 installed base of vehicles. Our RTCs complement our dealer network to provide our end users with the parts and service that they need to keep their fleets operating and to meet the demand of their customers. The services that we provide at our RTC locations include normal maintenance and service activities, damage repair and rebuilding services. Rebuilding services include manufacturer certified repair and apparatus remounting processes that can extend the life of a vehicle and reduce the total cost of ownership for our end users.
 Engineering, Research and Development
 We believe our engineering, research and development (“R&D”) capabilities are essential to ensure we remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We continue to engage in new product development, enhancement and testing to improve both existing products and the development of new vehicles and components.
 Virtually all of our vehicle sales require some level of custom engineering to meet customer specifications and evolving industry standards. In the Fire & Emergency segment, engineering and development activities include the design and production of customized equipment to meet the specific needs and applications of our customers. In the Commercial segment, the design and functionality of our buses and specialty equipment is constantly updated to improve passenger safety, functionality, access and comfort. In the Recreation segment, overall design, floorplan layout, functionality and amenities require frequent updating to address changes in consumer preferences and to enhance our existing product offerings.
 R&D costs are expensed as incurred and included as part of operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s R&D costs include only those incurred for the design of a new vehicle platform that is made commercially available to a broad portion of our end markets. Our R&D expenses do not include the costs to design and develop specific customized products to individual customers or end users. These costs are included as normal production costs associated with the sale of the specific product for which they were incurred. R&D costs totaled $4.8 million, $6.5 million and $4.2 million for fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Suppliers and Materials
 In fiscal year 2019, we purchased $1.5 billion of chassis, direct materials and other components from outside suppliers. The largest component of these purchases was for vehicle chassis, representing 29% of the total purchase amount. These chassis are sourced from major automotive manufacturers, including Ford, Freightliner, General Motors, and other original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). These OEMs provide us with standardized, mass-produced chassis models, which we then convert for our customers under approved “authorized converter” agreements with the OEMs. We have tailored our products and processes to the specifications of these OEM agreements and have built customer expectations and planning around these designs. Therefore, we are reliant on a consistent supply of chassis and the maintenance of our status as “approved converters” in order to maintain our sales.
 15


We also purchase and utilize other materials in our production processes including: steel and aluminum in our apparatus and passenger compartment manufacturing, engines and drivetrain (transmissions, axles) components for our manufactured chassis in the transit bus, RV, fire apparatus and terminal truck businesses, lighting packages for our emergency and school bus products and HVAC systems and parts, seats and seatbelts, doors, lifts, electrical switches and components, hydraulic components and miscellaneous hardware. We also purchase materials that contain or are composed of certain raw or base materials such as paint, fiberglass parts and chassis body components, wood and wood parts, brass and certain other petroleum-based resins such as plastic. 
 We utilize a centralized sourcing model that includes a dedicated team of procurement professionals to complement our segment sourcing teams so that we can coordinate and leverage our purchases across a diverse supplier base. Our centralized sourcing model leverages our growing scale within our markets to achieve competitive pricing and ensure availability. Furthermore, we have historically integrated our acquired companies into our centralized sourcing model to lower their costs. We do not typically enter into sourcing arrangements that are more than 18 to 24 months in duration and we do not undertake defined purchase agreements requiring fixed commitments or “take or pay” requirements with our vendors.
 We strive to maintain strong and collaborative relationships with our suppliers and believe that the sources for these inputs are well-established, generally available on world markets and are in sufficient quantity, other than chassis, such that we would expect to avoid disruption to our businesses if we encountered an interruption from one of our key suppliers.
 Intellectual Property
 Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business and can provide us with a competitive advantage. We also rely on trade secrets, design and manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We periodically review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, in an effort to avoid infringement on third-party proprietary rights and protect our own, identify licensing or partnership opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.
 We own a portfolio of intellectual property, including approximately 51 patents, confidential technical information and technological expertise in manufacturing specialty vehicles. We also own approximately 400 registered trademarks in the United States for certain trade names and important products. Due to the markets in which we operate, we believe that our trade names are the most valuable component of our intellectual property. We believe that our intellectual property rights, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions are adequate for our business and have an active program to maintain these rights. Our well-respected and widely recognized proprietary trade names include: E-ONE, KME, Ferrara, Wheeled Coach, AEV, HEV, LEV, Marque, McCoy Miller, Eldorado, Champion, Collins, Goshen Coach, ENC, World Trans, Capacity, Lay-Mor, Fleetwood RV, Monaco, American Coach, Holiday Rambler, Renegade and Midwest.
 While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent primarily on our patents or trademarks or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents to manufacture our products. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks. For more information on these risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Intellectual property risks may adversely affect our business and may dilute our competitive advantage.”
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 Our ongoing global operations are subject to a wide range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to water discharges, air emissions, the generation, storage, handling, use, release, disposal and transportation of hazardous materials and wastes, environmental cleanup, the health and safety of our employees and the fuel economy and emissions of the vehicles we manufacture. Certain of our operations require environmental, health and safety permits or other approvals from governmental authorities, and certain of these permits and approvals are subject to expiration, denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Compliance with these laws, regulations, permits and approvals is a significant factor in our business. We have expended resources, both financial and managerial, to comply with environmental laws and worker safety laws and maintain procedures designed to foster and ensure compliance, and we are committed to protecting our employees and the environment against the risks associated with these substances. However, our failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or permit or approval requirements could result in substantial liabilities or civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions, as well as business disruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
 16


In addition, we may be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for the investigation, remediation and monitoring, as well as associated costs, expenses and third-party damages, including tort liability and natural resource damages, relating to past or present releases of hazardous substances on or from our properties or the properties of our predecessor companies, or third-party sites to which we or our predecessor companies have sent hazardous waste for disposal or treatment. Liability under these laws may be imposed without regard to fault and may be joint and several. For example, in April 2012, we received a request for information from the EPA regarding the contamination of soil and groundwater at the San Fernando Valley Area 2 Superfund Site (the “San Fernando Site”). This site is regional in scale, encompasses large portions of the Los Angeles area, and potentially involves many persons (known as “potentially responsible parties” or “PRPs”). The EPA has overseen investigative and remedial activities at the San Fernando Site for many years. Historically, the agency has focused on volatile organic compound (“VOC”) contamination. More recently, the EPA identified chromium as a contaminant of concern at the San Fernando Site, and we believe that it was in that connection that the EPA sent us a request for information regarding whether a prior owner or operator of a facility located within the boundary of the San Fernando Site is a predecessor company to us (although we do not currently operate a facility in such area). The precise nature and extent of VOC and chromium contamination at the San Fernando Site, the nature and cost of any remedial actions that the EPA may require in connection with such contamination, the number and identity of PRPs that might share in responsibility for the VOC and chromium contamination, and whether the Company will become involved as a PRP are not known at this time. If we were to become involved as a PRP at the San Fernando Site, we could be compelled to contribute to the cost of investigations and remediation at the site. We are unable to estimate the potential impact of this liability at this time, and our ability to collect on our insurance policies for remediation costs or damages in connection with any claims relating to the San Fernando Site is unknown at this time. This liability would be allocated among us and other PRPs that are solvent. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operations and the industries in which we operate are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we may face significant costs or liabilities associated with environmental, health and safety matters.”
 Competition
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We compete with both divisions of large, diversified companies as well as private and public companies which are pure play participants in one of our product markets. Several of our competitors may have more financial resources than us but we have also been increasing the scope and scale of the products we produce and the markets we serve. We believe that through this growth we are developing a relatively scaled business across all three of our segments, which creates a competitive advantage against a large portion of our competition and makes us more relevant compared to our larger competitors. We believe that we have been able to effectively compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, total cost of ownership, breadth of product offerings, manufacturing capability and flexibility, client-specific customization, price, technical capability, product innovation, customer service and delivery times. We also believe that we have enhanced our competitive position by expanding our parts and service business model through the development of aftermarket service centers, which we refer to as Regional Technical Centers, and the establishment of dedicated parts warehouses. The combination of our products, aftermarket support and large installed base of vehicles provides us with a competitive advantage across our end markets.
In the Fire & Emergency segment, our competition includes Pierce Manufacturing (Oshkosh Corp.), Rosenbauer International, Spartan Motors, Inc., Demers Ambulance, Crestline, Medix Specialty Vehicles, FWD Seagrave and Life Line Emergency Vehicles, among others. In the Commercial segment, our competition includes Starcraft Bus (Forest River), Thomas Bus (Daimler), Blue Bird Corporation, Gillig, Nova Bus (Volvo), Navistar International, Inc., TICO, Kalmar (Cargotec) and New Flyer Industries, Inc., among others. In the Recreation segment, our competition includes Thor Industries, Inc., Winnebago Industries, Inc., Forest River, and Tiffin Motorhomes, Inc., among others.
 Employees
 As of October 31, 2019, we had approximately 8,040 employees. Our employees are not currently represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
