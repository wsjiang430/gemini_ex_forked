B. UTILITY SEGMENT
ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS
We are the largest electric utility in the state of Wisconsin. We generate and distribute electric energy to customers located in southeastern Wisconsin (including the metropolitan Milwaukee area), east central Wisconsin, and northern Wisconsin, and serve an iron ore mine customer, Tilden, in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Through December 31, 2016, we served other electric customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Effective January 1, 2017, we transferred our electric customers (other than Tilden) and electric distribution assets located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC, a stand-alone utility owned by WEC Energy Group. See Note 3, Related Parties, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. UMERC currently meets its market obligations through power purchase agreements with us and WPS. UMERC will begin to generate electricity when its new generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan begins commercial operation, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2019.

* | Includes SSR revenues, rent income, and ancillary revenues, partially offset by revenues from Tilden that are being deferred until a future rate proceeding. For more information, see the discussion below under the heading "Large Electric Retail Customers."

Electric Sales
Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail and wholesale customers. In 2018, retail electric revenues accounted for 90.7% of total electric operating revenues, while wholesale and resale electric revenues accounted for 8.2% of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Utility Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class.
We are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. Although we no longer provide electric service in certain territories in the state of Michigan, we continue, on an interim basis, to provide service to the Tilden mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. See the discussion below under the heading "Large Electric Retail Customers." 
We buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our individual generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets compared to our competitors affects how often our generating units are dispatched and whether we buy or sell power based on our customers' needs. For more information, see D. Regulation.
Steam Sales
We have a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by VAPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions. In April 2016, we sold the MCPP steam generation and distribution assets, located in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. MCPP primarily provided steam to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center hospitals and other campus buildings. See Note 2, Dispositions, for more information. 
Electric Sales Forecast
Our service territory experienced growth in weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2018 due to customer growth. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the Tilden iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, to grow between 0.5% and 1.0% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. Electric peak demand is expected to grow between flat and 0.5% over the next five years. The Tilden mine will no longer be a retail customer of ours once UMERC's new generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan begins commercial operation, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. At that time, Tilden will become a retail customer of UMERC.

Large Electric Retail Customers
We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in industries such as governmental, municipalities, cooperatives, and marketers, metals and other manufacturing, food products, health services, mining, education, and paper.
In February 2015, Tilden, along with another affiliated iron ore mine located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, returned as customers after choosing an alternative electric supplier in September 2013. We entered into a contract with each of the mines to provide full requirements electric service through December 31, 2019. Since 2015, we have been deferring, and expect to continue to defer, the revenues less costs of sales from the mine sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding, as ordered by the PSCW. 
In 2016, one of the iron ore mines closed, and the related contract for full requirements electric service was terminated. In August 2016, WEC Energy Group entered into a new agreement with Tilden under which it will purchase electric power from UMERC for 20 years for the remaining mine, contingent upon UMERC's construction of natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Tilden will continue to receive full requirements electric service from us under the existing contract until UMERC's generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan begins commercial operation, which is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2019. See Note 3, Related Parties, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information. 
Wholesale Customers
We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. Wholesale sales accounted for 5.2%, 4.6%, and 3.2% of total electric energy sales volumes during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Wholesale revenues accounted for 3.4%, 3.6%, and 2.6% of total electric operating revenues during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Resale
The majority of our sales for resale are sold into an energy market operated by MISO at market rates based on availability of our generation and market demand. Resale sales accounted for 15.3%, 23.5%, and 23.0% of total electric energy sales volumes during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Resale revenues accounted for 4.8%, 7.1%, and 6.5% of total electric operating revenues during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Retail fuel costs are reduced by the amount that revenue exceeds the costs of sales derived from these opportunity sales.
Electric Generation and Supply Mix
Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. Through our participation in the MISO Energy Markets, we supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own or lease from We Power. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed under the heading "Power Purchase Commitments," and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. We also sell excess capacity into the MISO Energy Markets when it is economical, which reduces net fuel costs by offsetting costs of purchased power.

2018 Form 10-K | 5 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Our rated capacity by fuel type as of December 31, including the units we lease from We Power, is shown below. For more information on our electric generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

* | Although the generation of PIPP has been included as a source of our electric energy supply for the three years ended December 31, we have only included this generation facility as a source of our estimated 2019 electric energy supply through its expected retirement date on or before May 31, 2019. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.

Reshaping our Generation Fleet
The following discussion summarizes information about our generation facilities, including the planned reshaping of our generation fleet to balance reliability and customer cost with environmental stewardship. Generation reshaping includes retiring older fossil fuel generation units, building state-of-the-art natural gas generation, and investing in cost-effective zero-carbon generation with a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 40% and 80% below 2005 levels by 2030 and 2050, respectively.

2018 Form 10-K | 6 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Coal-Fired Generation
As of December 31, 2018, our coal-fired generation, including the ERGS units we lease from We Power, consists of three operating plants with a rated capacity of 2,489 MW. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
We plan to retire approximately 1,500 MW of coal-fired generation by 2020, as a result of WEC Energy Group's generation reshaping plan. As part of this effort during 2018, we retired the Pleasant Prairie power plant, which accounted for approximately 1,190 MW of coal-fired generation. We are required to retire PIPP by May 31, 2019. For more information about the retirement of these plants, see Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment. 
Natural Gas-Fired Generation
Our natural gas-fired generation, including the PWGS units we lease from We Power, consists of four operating plants, including peaking units, with a rated capacity of 2,300 MW as of December 31, 2018. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Oil-Fired Generation
Our oil-fired generation had a rated capacity of 190 MW as of December 31, 2018. We also have natural gas-fired peaking units with a rated capacity of 799 MW, which have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 
Renewable Generation
We meet a portion of our electric generation supply with various renewable energy resources. This helps us maintain compliance with renewable energy legislation in Wisconsin and Michigan. These renewable energy resources also help us maintain diversity in our generation portfolio, which effectively serves as a price hedge against future fuel costs, and will help mitigate the risk of potential unknown costs associated with any future carbon restrictions for electric generators. For more information about our renewable generation, see Item 2. Properties. 
In December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource pilot program, a program for customers who wish to access a large-scale renewable project located in Wisconsin that we would operate. The project will contribute toward meeting our peak demand, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to our portfolio.
Solar
In December 2018, we received approval from the PSCW for the Solar Now pilot program, which is expected to add 35 MW of renewables to our portfolio and will allow commercial and industrial customers to site solar arrays on their property.
Hydroelectric
Our hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with a total installed capacity of 91 MW and a rated capacity of 53 MW as of December 31, 2018. All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 
Wind
We have four wind sites, consisting of 200 turbines, with an installed capacity of 339 MW and a rated capacity of 46 MW as of December 31, 2018. 
Biomass
We have a biomass-fueled power plant at a Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a rated capacity of approximately 46 MW of electric power as well as steam to support the paper mill's operations. Fuel for the power plant is supplied by both the paper mill and through contracts with biomass suppliers. The plant also has the ability to burn natural gas if wood waste and wood shavings are not available. 

2018 Form 10-K | 7 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Generation from Leased We Power Units
As discussed above, we also supply electricity to our customers from power plants that we lease from We Power. These plants include the ERGS units and the PWGS units. Lease payments are billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC, and the FERC. We operate the We Power units and are authorized by the PSCW and state law to fully recover prudently incurred operating and maintenance costs in our Wisconsin electric rates. As the operator of the units, we may request We Power to make capital improvements to, or further investments in, the units. Under the lease terms, these capital improvements or further investments will increase lease payments paid by us and should ultimately be recovered in our rates.
Electric System Reliability
The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. In 2008, the PSCW established a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 17.1% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2018, through May 31, 2019, and a 16.8% installed capacity reserve margin requirement for the planning year from June 1, 2019, through May 31, 2020. MISO's short-term reserve margin requirements experience year-to-year fluctuations, primarily due to changes in the average forced outage rate of generation within the MISO footprint. 
Michigan legislation requires all electric providers to demonstrate to the MPSC that they have enough resources to serve the anticipated needs of their customers for a minimum of four consecutive planning years beginning in the upcoming planning year June 1, 2019, through May 31, 2020. The MPSC has established future planning reserve margin requirements based on the same study conducted by MISO that determines the short-term reserve margin requirements.
In both of our Wisconsin and Michigan jurisdictions, we had adequate capacity through company-owned generation units, leased generating units, and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during the current planning year. We also fully anticipate that we will have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements for the upcoming planning year in both jurisdictions. However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure, or unavailability across the 15-state MISO footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures. Load management procedures allow for the reduction of energy use through agreements with customers to directly shut off their equipment or through interruptible service, where customers agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption.
Fuel and Purchased Power Costs
Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customer. For more information about the fuel rules, see D. Regulation.
Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the years ended December 31:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Coal | $ | 22.39 | | | $ | 22.26 | | $ | 22.68
Natural gas combined cycle | 22.05 | | | 22.85 | | | 19.13 
Natural gas/oil peaking units | 63.29 | | | 60.44 | | | 46.99 
Biomass | 97.33 | | | 118.76 | | | 103.24
Purchased power | 45.66 | | | 45.50 | | | 43.51 

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. In the past, coal and associated transportation services were exposed to volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and diesel fuel. To moderate the volatility, we were given PSCW approval for a hedging program, which allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to rail transportation fuel surcharge exposure. However, due to decreased volatility over the last few years, we suspended the fuel surcharge hedging program in 2017. 

2018 Form 10-K | 8 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. We also have a PSCW-approved program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our estimated natural gas use for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. 
Our hedging programs are generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. The results of these programs are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power. 
Coal Supply
We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming, as well as from various other states. For 2019, approximately 89% of our total projected coal requirements of 6.4 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract.
The annual tonnage amounts contracted for the next two years are as follows. We have not entered into any coal contracts for years after 2020.

(in thousands) | Annual Tonnage
2019 | 5,733 
2020 | 1,925 

Coal Deliveries
All of our 2019 coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Montana. The coal is transported by train to our rail-served electric-generating facilities and to dock storage in Superior, Wisconsin, until needed by our lake vessel-served facility, PIPP. See Note 6, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information about the planned retirement of PIPP. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities.
Midcontinent Independent System Operator Costs
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the MISO Energy Markets, which include its bid-based energy and ancillary services markets. We are a participant in the MISO Energy Markets. For more information on MISO, see D. Regulation.
Power Purchase Commitments
We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. Our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties are 1,279 MW per year for 2019 through 2021 and 1,033 MW per year for 2022 and 2023, which exclude planning capacity purchases. These amounts include 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. Due to the actual and planned retirement of generation resources, we have entered into purchase agreements to procure additional planning capacity in order to maintain our compliance with planning reserve requirements as established by the PSCW, MPSC, and MISO. 
Other Matters
Seasonality
Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, we did not require public appeals for conservation, and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. 

2018 Form 10-K | 9 | Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Competition
We face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources. We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 
For more information on competition in our service territories, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Competitive Markets.
Environmental Matters
For information regarding environmental matters, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies. 
NATURAL GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS
We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned natural gas. We operate in three distinct service areas including west and south of the City of Milwaukee, the Appleton area, and areas within Iron and Vilas Counties, Wisconsin.
We provide natural gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include governmental, food and kindred products, education, real estate, and metal manufacturing. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Utility Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on natural gas sales volumes by customer class.

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage
We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies.
Pipeline and Storage Capacity
The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 
Due to variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 40% of forecasted demand for November through March. Diversity of natural gas supply enables us to manage significant changes in demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months and withdraw it in the winter months.
In June 2017, our parent company completed its acquisition of Bluewater. Bluewater owns natural gas storage facilities in Michigan that provide a portion of the current storage needs for our natural gas utility operations. We have entered into a long-term service agreement to take a portion of the storage from Bluewater. See Note 3, Related Parties, for more information on this transaction.
We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts.
Pipeline and storage capacity and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Peak or near-peak demand generally occurs only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate utilization of capacity and supply during times when the contracted capacity and supply are in excess of utility demand. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to customers, subject to our approved GCRM. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Operating Revenues.
To ensure a reliable supply of natural gas during peak winter conditions, we have liquefied natural gas and propane facilities located within our distribution system. These facilities are typically utilized during extreme demand conditions to ensure reliable supply to our customers.
Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our forecasted design peak-day throughput is 10.1 million therms for the 2018 through 2019 heating season. Our peak daily send-out during 2018 was 6.8 million therms on January 1, 2018.
Natural Gas Supply
We have contracts for firm supplies with terms of 3–5 months with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices.
We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market.

Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices
We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. This approval allows us to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums, brokerage fees and losses) and proceeds (gains) to customers through our GCRM.
To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRM.
Seasonality
Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to some variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.
The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of our winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period.
Competition
We face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternative fuels. Commercial and industrial customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. We offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third-party natural gas suppliers and use our distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities. We earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change.
C. OTHER SEGMENT
Our other segment included Bostco, our non-utility subsidiary that was originally formed to develop and invest in real estate. In March 2017, we sold substantially all of the remaining assets of Bostco, and, in October 2018, Bostco was dissolved. See Note 2, Dispositions, for more information. 
Prior to January 1, 2017, our other segment also included our approximate 23% ownership interest in ATC, a for-profit, transmission-only company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions. Effective January 1, 2017, we transferred our investment in ATC to another subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. See Note 16, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information. 
D. REGULATION
In addition to the specific regulations noted below, we are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

Rates

Our rates were regulated by the various commissions shown in the table below during 2018. These commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

Regulated Rates | Regulatory Commission
Retail electric, natural gas, and steam | PSCW 
Retail electric | MPSC * 
Wholesale power | FERC 


* | Effective January 1, 2017, we transferred all of our electric distribution assets and customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to UMERC, with the exception of Tilden. See Note 3, Related Parties, and Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information.

Embedded within our electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of our symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of our approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. Our deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If our ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which our return exceeds the authorized amount. Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customer and our wholesale electric customers. 
Our natural gas utility operates under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 
See Note 1(d), Operating Revenues, for more information on the significant mechanisms we had in place during 2018 that allowed us to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts.
We have been subject to an earnings sharing mechanism since January 2016, and will continue to be subject to it through 2019. See Note 21, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our earnings sharing mechanism and on how our rates are set.

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets
In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO operates bid-based energy markets. MISO has been able to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. 
In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint.
As part of MISO, a market-based platform is used for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that is used in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to hedge transmission congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2018, through May 31, 2019. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period.
MISO has an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources can be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. All of our capacity requirements during the planning year from June 1, 2018, through May 31, 2019 were met.
Other Electric Regulations
We are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards.
We are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin and Public Acts 295 and 342 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation.
All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations.
Other Natural Gas Regulations
Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the PSCW are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 191 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline; Annual Reports, Incident Reports, and Safety-Related Condition Reports), 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards), and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline).
We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territory. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to our low-income customers.

E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs.
Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Requirements. For a discussion of matters related to manufactured gas plant sites and air and water quality, see Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies.
