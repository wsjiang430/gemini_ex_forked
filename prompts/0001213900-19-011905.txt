Strategy
 
The Company is the proprietary owner of emission control technologies with three distinct applications:
 

● | ENVI-MarineTM, for the marine industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | ENVI-PureTM, for the waste to energy and biomass industries; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | ENVI-CleanTM, designed for coal fired power electricity generation and industrial plants involved in steel generation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The first of the Company’s technologies to gain significant traction has been ENVI-MarineTM. During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company secured an order book for its ENVI-MarineTM technology of approximately USD$180 million.
 
The Company proactively seeks the acquisition and development of other technologies designed to improve the environment.
 
ENVI-MarineTM
 
Diesel exhaust from ships, ferries and tankers includes ash and soot as particulate components and sulphur dioxide as an acid gas. Testing has been conducted on diesel shipping to confirm the application of seawater as a neutralizing agent for sulphur emissions as well as capturing particulate matter. In addition to marine applications, these tests also showed applicability of the system for large displacement engines such as stationary generators, compressors, container handling, heavy construction and mining equipment.

In 2017, the Company manufactured the components for an ENVI-Marine unit that was installed on MV Westminster, a chemical ship owned by Union Maritime Limited (“Union”). Under the terms of an Energy Management Lease dated December 16, 2016, Union will make quarterly payments of $118,000 to the Company determined as their estimated savings realized by the ENVI-Marine units’ operation up to an aggregate of $1,995,000.
 
The Company has been actively marketing its ENVI-Marine™ units to ship brokers and ship owners through most of the year. In the year ended 31 March 2019, our company and its subsidiaries have successfully executed several agreements;
 

● | on September 5, 2018, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Pacific Green Marine Technologies Inc. (“PGMT”), had signed an agreement with an unnamed international operator for twenty-five (25) production slots. The operator, which operates internationally with a substantial fleet of multiple times the production slots they have reserved, has entered into the agreement to secure production availability to December 2021;

ENVI-PureTM
 
Increasing legislation relating to landfill of municipal solid waste has led to the emergence of increasing numbers of waste to energy plants (“WtE”). A WtE plant obviates the need for landfill, burning municipal waste for conversion to electricity. A WtE plant is typically 45-100MW. The ENVI-Pure™ system is particularly suited to WtE as it cleans multiple pollutants in a single system. The Company has successfully tested its ENVI-Pure™ technology at a WtE plant in Edmonton, England, United Kingdom, and is in discussions regarding the installation of its technologies at WtE facilities in China.
 
ENVI-CleanTM
 
EnviroTechnologies Inc. has successfully conducted sulphur dioxide demonstration tests at the American Bituminous Coal Partners power plant in Grant Town, West Virginia. The testing achieved a three test average of 99.3% removal efficiency. The implementation of US Clean Air regulations in July 2010 has created additional demand for sulphur dioxide removal in all industries emitting sulphur pollution. Furthermore, China consumes approximately one half of the world’s coal, but introduced measures designed to reduce energy and carbon intensity in its 12th Five Year Plan. Applications include regional power facilities and heating for commercial buildings and greenhouses. Typical applications range in size from 1 to 20 megawatts (MW) with power generation occupying the larger end of the range.
 
Following the signing of a joint venture agreement with Power China SPEM, an ENVI-Clean™ was sold to a steelworks company in Yancheng to remove SO2 from its 93MW gas combustion powerplant.

The ENVI-Clean™ system removes most of the sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, greenhouse gases and other hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels.

Significant transactions
 
There have been no significant transactions during the year ended 31 March 2019 that are not in the ordinary course of the Company’s business.
  
Form of any subsequent acquisitions
 
The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, our respective needs and desires and those of the promoters of the opportunity, and our relative negotiating strength compared to that of such promoters.
 
It is likely that we will acquire further participations in business opportunities through the issuance of our common stock, or other of our securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization.
 
Our stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of our voting securities following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, our directors may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.
 
In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by our stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving our company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of our outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to us of the related costs incurred.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from various companies involved in the environmental technology industries and specifically companies involved in filtering of pollutants.

Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. To successfully compete in our industry we will need to:

● | establish our product’s competitive advantage with customers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
As we are a newly-established company, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as lack of available funds. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark, except for the proprietary emission abatement systems, currently known as:
 

● | ENVI-Clean™;
--+-------------


● | ENVI-Pure™, for removing acid gases, particulate matter, dioxins, VOCs and other regulated hazardous air pollutants from the flue gases produced by the combustion of coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, diesel and other fuels; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ENVI-Marine™, a scrubber that can be applied to diesel exhaust emissions that require sulphur and particulate matter abatement, (ENVI-Clean™, ENVI-Pure™ and ENVI-Marine™ together, the “Technologies”).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The ENVI-Clean™ system has protected intellectual property rights throughout most of the world. Its technology is protected by Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application no. PCT/CA210/000988 filed June 25, 2010 with a priority filing date of June 25, 2009. The International Preliminary Report on Patentability for this PCT application considered all patent claims of the application to be patentable. EnviroTechnologies has pending national or regional phase patent applications claiming priority from PCT/CA2010/000988 covering 127 countries. Once patents issue, patent rights in this technology will generally endure until June 25, 2030.
 
Further, we own the rights to the US provisional patent application no. US 61/614696 for the integrated wet scrubbing system. Additionally, we own the rights to US provisional patent application no. US 61/645874 for the flooded wet scrubbing head patent.

Effective 24 May, 2019, the appointment of Richard Oliver as Chief Financial Officer.
 
Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of our company. Our subsidiary companies employ approximately 45 employees, and the number of employees continue to grow as the Company’s operations expand. We engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our operations.
Government Regulations
 
Some aspects of our intended operations will be subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules and regulations in North America and worldwide relating to, among other things, worker safety and the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. For example, we are subject to the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (“RCRA”), the principal federal legislation regulating hazardous waste generation, management and disposal.
 
Under some of the laws regulating the use, storage, discharge and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Laws of this nature often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the removal or remediation of pollutants and may impose civil and criminal penalties for violations. Some of the laws and regulations authorize the recovery of natural resource damages by the government, injunctive relief and the imposition of stop, control, remediation and abandonment orders. The costs arising from compliance with environmental and natural resource laws and regulations may increase operating costs for both us and our potential customers. We are also subject to safety policies of jurisdictional-specific Workers Compensation Boards and similar agencies regulating the health and safety of workers.
 
We are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits, licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations. We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our intended business. At this time, we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures to comply with environmental or various regulations and requirements.
 
While our intended projects or business activities have been designed to produce environmentally friendly green energy or other alternative products for which no specific regulatory barriers exist, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs and decreasing potential demand for our technologies, products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
