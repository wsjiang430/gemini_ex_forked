ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company
 Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. is an international specialty retailer and distributor of professional beauty supplies with operations in North America, South America and Europe. We are one of the largest distributors of professional beauty supplies in the U.S. based on store count. At September 30, 2019, we operated two business segments, Sally Beauty Supply (“SBS”) and Beauty Systems Group (“BSG”), with 4,902 company-operated stores, 159 franchised stores and e-commerce platforms. SBS targets retail consumers, salons and salon professionals, while BSG exclusively targets salons and salon professionals. Within BSG, we also have one of the largest networks of distributor sales consultants (“DSCs”) for professional beauty products in North America, with approximately 748 sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals. 
 We provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third-party branded and owned-brand professional beauty supplies, including hair color and care products, styling tools, skin and nail care products and other beauty items. For each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, over 80% of our consolidated net sales were from customers located in the U.S. 
 Our leading channel positions and multi-channel platform afford us several advantages, including hair color and hair care expertise, strong positioning with suppliers, the ability to better service the highly fragmented beauty supply marketplace and economies of scale. Through our multi-channel platform, we are able to reach broad, diversified geographies, and customer segments using varying product assortments. 
 Our stores are conveniently located and offer a wide selection of competitively priced beauty products, beauty solutions and expertise delivered by our knowledgeable salespeople. We also offer a comprehensive selection of multi-cultural products we believe further differentiates us from our competitors.
 We believe that our DSCs distinguish us from other full-service/exclusive-channel distributors by providing us with a better understanding of our professional customers’ needs. In addition to placing orders through our DSCs, our customers have the ability to order and pick up the products they need between visits from our DSCs by visiting a nearby BSG store. We believe that our differentiated customer value proposition and strong brands drive customer loyalty.
 Operating Strategy
 Our mission is to empower our customers to express themselves through hair. Our strategy is to be the expert and leader in hair color and care for the consumer and the salon professional. We focus on hair color and care through our strategic product assortment, leading experiences in color, and building compelling customer experiences while also increasing our operating efficiency and profitability.
 Our strategic product assortment includes being the partner of choice for brands and influencers. We believe that we offer our customers a strong and differentiated value proposition by providing salon-quality products, including an extensive collection of owned and exclusive-label brands and solutions at attractive prices.
 Our focus and experiences with color include a strong emphasis on our sales force. We believe our approach to recruiting, training, and compensation results in a highly knowledgeable and effective sales force.
 Our goal is to create an appealing shopping environment that embraces the retail consumer and salon professional and highlights our extensive product offering. We believe that our initiatives to create a compelling shopping environment, over time, will help drive increased customer traffic to our stores and increase their sales productivity.
 Our digital strategy is evolving from a largely transactional-based experience to a more content-rich experience that enables customers to learn about the latest trends and techniques from influencers and engages them with our latest product launches and research products. We believe that these efforts will, over time, drive traffic and improve sales from these sites.

Professional Beauty Supply Industry Distribution Channels
 The professional beauty supply industry serves end-users through four distribution channels: 
 Open-Line
 This channel serves retail consumers and salon professionals through retail stores and e-commerce platforms. This channel is served by a large number of localized retailers and distributors, with only a few having a regional or national presence and significant channel share. We believe that SBS, with its nationwide network of retail stores, is the largest open-line distributor in the U.S. In addition, SBS’s websites (including www.sallybeauty.com) and other e-commerce platforms, including our new SBS mobile commerce-based app, provide retail consumers and salon professionals access to product offerings and information beyond our retail stores.
 Full-Service/Exclusive
 This channel exclusively serves salons and salon professionals and distributes “professional-only” and other products for use in salons and for resale to consumers in salons. Many brands are distributed through exclusive arrangements with suppliers by geographic territory. BSG is one of the leading full-service distributors in the U.S. In addition, BSG offers its products for sale to salons and salon professionals through e-commerce platforms (including www.cosmoprofbeauty.com, www.cosmoprofequipment.com and the CosmoProf mobile commerce-based app).
 Direct
 This channel focuses on direct sales to salons and salon professionals by large manufacturers. This is the dominant form of distribution in Europe but represents a smaller channel in the U.S. due to the highly fragmented nature of the U.S. salon industry, which makes direct distribution costs prohibitive for many manufacturers. 
 Mega-Salon Stores
 In this channel, large-format salons are supplied directly by manufacturers due to their significant purchase requirements.
 Key Industry and Business Trends
 We believe the following key industry and business trends and characteristics will influence our business and our financial results going forward:
 High level of marketplace fragmentation. The U.S. salon industry is highly fragmented with salons and barbershops. Given the fragmented and small-scale nature of the salon industry, we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full-service/exclusive distributors and open-line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases. 
 Rapidly evolving consumer trends. Our industry is characterized by continuously changing fashion-related trends that drive new styles, including hair and nail styles, and continuing demand for beauty products. In addition, we expect millennials and the aging baby-boomer population in the U.S. to continue to drive sales growth in certain professional beauty product categories, including through an increase in the usage of hair color and care products. 
 Increasing use of owned and exclusive-label brand products. We offer an extensive range of owned and exclusive-label brand professional beauty products. Our lines of owned and exclusive-label brand products have matured and become better known in our retail stores and e-commerce platforms, showing an increase in sales. 
 Growth in chair renting and frequent stocking needs. Salon professionals primarily rely on just-in-time inventory due to capital constraints and limited warehouse and shelf space. In addition, chair renters and suite renters, who now comprise a significant percentage of the total U.S. salon professionals, are often responsible for purchasing their own supplies. The number of chair renters and suite renters has significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. Chair renters and suite renters, given their smaller and more frequent purchase patterns, are dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores. We expect that these factors will continue to drive demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores, like BSG and SBS.

Business Segments
 We operate in two business segments: (i) SBS, an open-line retailer of professional beauty supplies offering professional beauty supplies to both retail consumers and salon professionals, in North America, South America and Europe, and (ii) BSG, including its franchise-based business Armstrong McCall, a full-service beauty supply distributor offering professional brands directly to salons and salon professionals through our own sales force and professional-only stores, many in exclusive geographical territories, in North America. SBS stores generally operate under the Sally Beauty banner, while BSG stores generally operate under the CosmoProf banner. 
 Neither the sales nor the product assortment for SBS or BSG are generally seasonal in nature.
 The following table sets forth the percentage of our sales attributable to each of our major sales channels:
  
 | SBS | | | BSG 
------------------------------+---------------------------------+-------+---+--------------------------------
 | Fiscal Year Ended September 30, | | | Fiscal Year Ended September 30,
 | 2019 | | | 2018 | | 2017 | 2019 | | 2018 | | | 2017

  Store Design and Locations
 SBS stores are designed to create an appealing shopping environment that embraces the retail consumer and salon professional and highlights SBS’s extensive product offering. In the U.S. and Canada, SBS stores average approximately 1,700 square feet in size and are located primarily in strip shopping centers, which are occupied by other high traffic retailers such as grocery stores, mass merchants and home improvement centers. SBS applies strong category management processes, including centrally developed guides, to maintain consistent merchandise presentation across its store base. Store formats, including average size and product selection, outside the U.S. and Canada vary by marketplace.  
 SBS balances its store renewals, remodels and expansions between new and existing geographies and regularly evaluates each store’s performance and strategically closes stores as necessary. In its existing marketplaces, SBS adds stores as necessary to provide additional coverage. In new marketplaces, SBS generally seeks to expand in geographically contiguous areas to leverage its experience. SBS selects geographic areas and store sites on the basis of demographic information, the quality and nature of neighboring tenants, store visibility and location accessibility.
 As of September 30, 2019, SBS had 3,682 company-operated retail stores, 2,791 of which are located in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico), with the remaining 891 company-operated retail stores located in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Chile and Peru. SBS also supplied 13 franchised stores located in the United Kingdom, Belgium and certain other European countries. 
 BSG stores, including its franchise-based Armstrong McCall stores, are designed to create a professional shopping environment that highlights its extensive product offering and embraces the salon professional. Company-operated BSG stores average approximately 2,600 square feet and are located primarily in secondary strip shopping centers, since the stores are themselves a ‘destination’ for professionals not requiring a traffic-supporting neighbor retail location. BSG store layouts are designed to provide variety and options to the salon professional. Stores are segmented into distinctive areas arranged by product type, with certain areas dedicated to leading third-party brands. The selection of these and other brands varies by territory. 
 As of September 30, 2019, BSG operated 1,220 company-operated stores, with 1,099 located in the U.S. (including Puerto Rico) and the remaining 121 company-operated retail stores located in Canada. In addition, as of September 30, 2019, BSG supplied 146 franchised stores.
 Merchandise  
 SBS stores and websites carry an extensive selection of professional beauty supplies for retail customers, salons and salon professionals, featuring an average of 8,000 stock keeping units, or SKUs, of beauty products in our stores across a variety of product categories including hair color and care, skin and nail care, styling tools and other beauty

products. SBS’s stores and e-commerce platforms carry products from one or more of the leading manufacturers in each category, including third-party brands such as Wella®, Clairol®, OPI®, Conair® and Hot Shot Tools®, as well as an extensive selection of owned and exclusive-label brand products. We believe that delivering an extensive selection of leading third-party, owned and exclusive-label brand professional beauty products at attractive prices through knowledgeable sales associates and convenient store locations is what differentiates SBS. Additionally, we believe that carrying a wide selection of the latest premier branded merchandise is critical for SBS in building long-term relationships with its customers and attracting new customers. As beauty trends continue to evolve, SBS will continue to offer the changing professional beauty product assortment necessary to meet the needs of retail consumers and salon professionals. 
 In addition, SBS offers an extensive selection of owned and exclusive-label brand professional beauty products that are only available at SBS stores and through its e-commerce platforms. We believe that SBS’s owned and exclusive-label brand products offer equal or better quality products than higher-priced leading third-party brands, providing the customer attractive alternatives to those brands at lower prices. Generally, SBS’s owned-brand products have higher gross margins than the leading third-party branded products and, we believe, offer continued growth potential. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, owned and exclusive-label brand products accounted for approximately 45% of SBS’s product sales in the U.S. and Canada. SBS intends to continue to invest in the growth of its owned and exclusive-label brands and to actively promote these products.
 BSG’s stores and e-commerce platforms carry an extensive selection of third-party branded products, such as Paul Mitchell®, Wella®, Matrix®, Schwarzkopf®, Kenra®, Goldwell®, Joico® and Chi®, for salons and salon professionals at competitive prices. We feature an average of 10,500 SKUs of beauty products in our BSG stores across a variety of product categories including hair color and care, skin and nail care, styling tools and other beauty items. Additionally, BSG has exclusive and non-exclusive distribution rights for well-known brands in certain geographies with several key vendors. As part of its growth strategy, BSG continues to pursue the acquisition of additional distribution rights. We believe that carrying an extensive selection of branded merchandise is critical to maintaining relationships with our professional customers. 
 We believe BSG is the largest full-service distributor of professional beauty supplies in North America exclusively targeting salons and salon professionals. Through BSG’s large store base, e-commerce platforms and sales force, including Armstrong McCall, BSG is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented U.S. professional beauty salon products industry. 
 Marketing and Advertising 
 We continue to invest in new talent and capabilities in our digital commerce, brand marketing and strategy and global sourcing. As part of this effort, we have realigned our marketing and digital functions to create a new structure in which every team supports and fuels the growth for both SBS and BSG.  This allows us to leverage strong, centralized teams for areas such as e-commerce, loyalty and brand strategy, rather than trying to build duplicative capabilities for both segments.
 SBS’s marketing programs are designed to drive customer traffic by differentiating SBS as a source of professional advice, solutions and salon-quality products at competitive prices, all backed by our “Love It or Return It” guarantee.
 We continuously adapt our marketing initiatives and adjust our media and messaging mix to achieve a high return on our marketing and advertising dollars. We target existing and potential customers through an integrated marketing approach designed to reach the customer through a variety of media, including digital advertising, email, social media, text messaging, direct mail and print advertising. 
 We continue to refine the strategy for sallybeauty.com and other e-commerce platforms, shifting from largely transactional-based to a more content-rich experience that enables customers to learn about the latest trends and techniques from influencers, engage in our latest product launches and research products. We frequently update the home page to enhance its appeal to our existing and prospective customers. In addition, we continue to refine our internal processes and partnerships to increase traffic to the website. Many of our customers research products on our site before visiting a store. Beyond generating e-commerce sales, we believe our website and new SBS mobile app are important vehicles to reach consumers researching beauty products online who could potentially visit our stores as a result of their experience on our website or our SBS mobile app.

SBS’s customer loyalty and customer relationship management (“CRM”) programs, in the U.S. and Canada, allow SBS the opportunity to collect valuable point-of-sale customer data as a means of increasing its understanding of customers’ needs and enhancing its ability to market to them in more personalized, relevant ways. We continue to assess and update our customer loyalty and CRM programs in an effort to further enhance the customer experience and promote repeat sales from both retail customers and salon professionals. In our fiscal year 2019, we replaced our existing loyalty program, which required a nominal annual fee for discounts, with a more traditional points-based loyalty program. Outside the U.S. and Canada, our customer loyalty and marketing programs vary by marketplace.
 BSG’s marketing programs are designed primarily to promote its extensive selection of brand name products at competitive prices and to educate, motivate and empower its customers to grow professionally. BSG communicates on a frequent basis with its customers and potential customers, and distributes promotional material through multiple communication channels, including trade shows, educational events, store personnel, DSCs, print mail, e-mail, text and social media. In addition, we believe that BSG’s websites (www.cosmoprofequipment.com and www.cosmoprofbeauty.com) and the CosmoProf mobile commerce-based app enhance other efforts intended to promote awareness of BSG’s products by salons and salon professionals.  
 As of September 30, 2019, BSG had a network of 748 DSCs, which exclusively consult, support and sell directly to salons and salon professionals. In order to provide a knowledgeable sales consultant team, BSG actively recruits and trains individuals with industry knowledge or sales experience. We believe that DSCs with broad product knowledge and direct sales experience are more successful in driving sales. Our sales commission program is an important component of our DSCs compensation, which is designed to drive sales and to focus DSCs on selling products that are best suited to individual salons and salon professionals.
 Our Customers 
 We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of professional-grade beauty products sold directly to retail consumers, salons and salon professionals. Historically, these factors have provided us with reduced exposure to downturns in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate.
Our Competition
 The global beauty industry is highly competitive. SBS competes with domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets, including local and regional open-line beauty supply stores, professional-only beauty supply stores, mass merchandisers, online retailers, drug stores, department stores and supermarkets, as well as salons that sell hair care products. BSG competes primarily with domestic and international beauty product wholesale suppliers, including online retailers, and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals. The primary competitive factors in the beauty products distribution industry are the price at which branded and owned-brand products are sold to customers; exclusive distribution contracts; the quality, perceived value, consumer brand name recognition, packaging and variety of the products sold; customer service; the efficiency of distribution networks; and the availability of desirable store locations. 
We face competition from certain manufacturers that use their own sales forces to distribute their professional beauty products directly or that align themselves with our competitors. Some of these manufacturers are vertically integrating through the acquisition of distributors and stores. We also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon-only products. 
 Our Suppliers 
 We purchase our merchandise directly from manufacturers through supply contracts and by purchase orders. For the fiscal year 2019, our five largest suppliers – Coty, Inc., the Professional Products Division of L'Oreal USA S/D, Inc., or L’Oreal, John Paul Mitchell Systems, Conair Corporation, and Henkel AG & Co. KGaA – accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated merchandise purchases. Products are purchased from these and many other manufacturers on an at-will basis or under contracts which can generally be terminated without cause upon 90 days or less notice or expire without express rights of renewal.

Our Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 30,050 full-time and part-time employees.
 Regulation 
 We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, which historically have not had a material effect on our business. For example, in the U.S., most of the products sold and the content and methods of advertising and marketing utilized are subject to both federal and state regulations administered by a host of federal and state agencies, including, in each case, one or more of the following: the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. The transportation and disposal of many of our products are also subject to federal and state regulation. State and local agencies regulate many aspects of our business. We also face comprehensive regulation outside the U.S., focused primarily on product labeling and safety issues.
As of September 30, 2019, SBS and BSG supplied franchised stores located in the U.S., Mexico and certain countries in Europe. As a result of these franchisor-franchisee relationships, we are subject to regulation when offering and selling franchises in the applicable countries. The applicable laws and regulations affect our business practices, as franchisor, in a number of ways, including restrictions placed upon the offering, renewal, termination and disapproval of assignment of franchises. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a material effect upon our operations.
