Item 1. Business
Background and Overview
 
PAVmed is a highly-differentiated multi-product medical device company organized to advance a broad pipeline of innovative medical technologies we believe address unmet clinical needs and possess attractive market opportunities to commercialization. Since our inception on June 26, 2014, our activities have focused on advancing the lead products in our pipeline towards regulatory approval and commercialization, while protecting our intellectual property, and strengthening our corporate infrastructure and management team. As resources permit, we will continue to explore internal and external innovations that fulfill our project selection criteria without limiting ourselves to any target specialty or condition.
 
Since our inception in June 2014, we have financed our operations principally through issuances of our common stock, preferred stock, common stock purchase warrants, and debt, summarized as follows:
 
During 2018, we raised approximately $15.5 million of net proceeds, comprised of $20.5 million of gross proceeds, less $5.0 million used to repay debt ahead of the contractual maturity date, including:
 

* | In January 2018, we raised $4.3 million of net cash proceeds in an underwritten public offering of 2,649,818 shares of our common stock pursuant to our previously filed effective shelf registration statement on SEC Form S-3 - File No. 333-220549. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | In June 2018, we raised approximately $9.2 million of net cash proceeds from an Equity Subscription Rights Offering - “ESRO” pursuant to our previously filed effective registration statement on SEC Form S-1 - File No. 333-222581, wherein, 9.0 million units were issued comprised of a corresponding number of shares of our common stock and Series Z Warrants exercisable to purchase 9.0 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.60 per share. 
* | In December 2018, we raised approximately $7.0 million of net cash proceeds, after payment of $750,000 of lender fees, from the issue of a Senior Secured Convertible Note with a face value principal of $7.75 million to an institutional investor in a private placement. 
 | Promptly after the consummation of the issue of the Senior Secured Convertible Note, we repaid in full the outstanding principal balance and all accrued but unpaid interest expense as of December 27, 2018 on the Senior Secured Note held by our existing lender, Scopia Holdings LLC, with such repayment consisting of a cash payment of $5.0 million the issue of 600,000 shares of our common stock. 

 
Additionally during 2018, we also completed exchange offers of private securities and a Tender Offer of public warrants, including:
 

* | In March 2018, in an exchange offer captioned the “Series A and Series A-1 Exchange Offer”, we issued a total of 975,568 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for all of the issued and outstanding shares of each of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, and issued a total of 2,739,190 Series Z Warrants for all of the issued and outstanding of each of the Series A Warrants and the Series A-1 Warrants. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* | In April 2018, in an exchange offer captioned the “Series W Warrant Exchange Offer”, the Company completed a Tender Offer whereby 96.4% of the then outstanding publicly traded Series W Warrants, or 10,151,682 Series W Warrants, were exchanged for 5,075, 849 Series Z Warrants. 
 | The Series Z Warrants are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol PAVMZ, and each Series Z Warrant may be exercised to purchase a share of our common stock, initially at $3.00 per share through May 31, 2018, then $1.60 per share effective June 1, 2018, as a result of the Company’s board of directors approval on May 15, 2018 of such exercise price adjustment. 

 
During 2017 we raised a total of approximately $7.5 million of net cash proceeds from: a Note and Security Purchase Agreement with Scopia Holdings LLC, including the issuance of each of a Senior Secured Note with an initial face value principal of $5.0 million and Series S Warrants; the Series A-1 Preferred Stock Units private placement; and the Series A Preferred Stock Units private placement.
 
In April 2016 our IPO resulted in approximately $4.2 million of net cash proceeds, and prior to our IPO, we raised approximately $2.1 million of net cash proceeds from private offerings of our common stock and warrants.
 
Our multiple products are in various phases of development and have yet to receive regulatory approval. We have filed final nonprovisional patent applications for each of CarpX™ and PortIO™ and have obtained licenses for “DisappEAR™” from Tufts University and a group of academic centers, and for the “EsoCheck™ Technology” from Case Western Reserve University. We have recently hired a Chief Commercial Officer to further develop and implement our commercialization strategy in the United States and commercialization partnerships worldwide. The following is a brief overview of five lead products under development, including CarpX™, EsoCheck™, PortIO™, DisappEAR™, and NextFlo™.

Our CarpX product is designed to be a minimally invasive device designed to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. The Company believes CarpX will dramatically reduce recovery times compared to traditional open surgery and target an estimated immediately addressable domestic market opportunity of over $1 billion. PAVmed has been working closely with the FDA to secure U.S. regulatory clearance of CarpX through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, which is based on demonstrating substantial equivalence (SE) to a previously cleared predicate device. CarpX is being manufactured in Massachusetts by a medical device contract manufacturer with lines scalable to accommodate demand for the foreseeable future following regulatory clearance. We have advanced, in partnership with our design and contract manufacturing partners, our CarpX product from concept to working prototypes, completed successful benchtop and cadaver testing confirming the device consistently cuts the transverse carpal ligament, as well as commercial design and development, and performed pre-submission verification and validation testing.
 
On November 27, 2017, we filed with the Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the “FDA,” a premarket notification submission for CarpX under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the “FDCA,” using a commercially available carpel tunnel release device as a predicate. The initial 510(k) application review period expired before the FDA’s branches were able to reach a consensus on SE and it therefore recommended a 510(k) re-submission following an in-person pre-submission meeting held on January 7, 2019. During this meeting, the FDA recommended clinical testing to definitively document CarpX procedural safety in humans and indicated data from a properly structured clinical study outside of the U.S. would be acceptable, precluding the need to engage in the FDA’s time-consuming Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) process required for U.S. studies. PAVmed offered to amend its previously planned first-in-human (“FIH”) clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03747510) in New Zealand to meet this clinical testing recommendation and postponed the initiation of the amended study until study parameters were finalized with the FDA. We recently reached a consensus with the FDA on the parameters of the CarpX FIH safety study, including pre- and post-operative electrodiagnostic testing to document device safety. The CarpX FIH safety study is a single-arm, two-center, two-surgeon, 20-patient study of the CarpX procedure in carpal tunnel syndrome patients, with a device safety primary endpoint defined as the absence of certain serious device-related adverse events over a limited 90-day follow-up period. Patients are currently undergoing pre-operative assessment and CarpX procedures are expected soon thereafter, subject-to customary procedure consents timely completed by each patient. We will also be preparing to submit CarpX for CE Mark clearance in Europe.
 
In May 2018, our majority-owned subsidiary Lucid Diagnostics Inc. entered into a license agreement with Case Western Reserve University, or “CWRU,” - referred to as the “EsoCheck License Agreement,” pursuant to which Lucid Diagnostics Inc. obtained the worldwide intellectual property rights to the “EsoCheck™ Technology”. The EsoCheck™ Technology consists of the “EsoCheck™ Cell Collection Device™” - “EsoCheck™ CCD™” - and the “EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™”, a panel of methylated DNA biomarkers. The EsoCheck™ Technology is intended for use to detect “Barrett’s Esophagus” (“BE”), which is a primary precursor to esophageal cancer. At this time, the EsoCheck™ Technology is progressing through a two-phase regulatory and commercialization strategy which seeks to maximize the long-term commercial opportunity while providing near-term commercial milestones.
 
With respect to the first phase of the EsoCheck™ Technology strategy, we previously submitted EsoCheck™ CCD™ for FDA 510(k) clearance in late November 2018 and received an initial response from the FDA in late January 2019. This Additional Information (“AI”) letter requested additional head-to-head effectiveness data relative to previously cleared esophageal cell collection devices. We have discussed this request with the FDA reviewer and will be submitting existing human cell count data of EsoCheck™ CCD™ vs. endoscopic brushings, collected from the ongoing NIH trial, to fulfill this request. The AI letter also requested some additional technical data related to the manufacturing and verification and validation testing of the device which will be ready for submission shortly. The EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ methylated DNA biomarkers laboratory test is progressing toward achieving a Laboratory Developed Test (“LDT”) designation at its designated clinical reference laboratory in Cleveland in early 2019. We are prepared to file for EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ reimbursement codes through the American Medical Association’s Proprietary Laboratory Analysis - “AMA PLA” - process as soon as the test is available as an LDT.
 
The second phase of our EsoCheck™ Technology regulatory and commercialization strategy seeks a specific indication for widespread BE screening based on existing American College of Gastroenterology (“ACG”) guidelines, which recommend BE screening of up 20 million GERD patients. We have positioned resources to allow the EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ second phase to move forward in an accelerated fashion. The multi-center NIH-funded clinical trial comparing EsoCheck™ CCD™ plus EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ to endoscopy has enrolled 200 patients and interim results have been accepted for presentation at the major annual gastroenterology meeting, Digestive Diseases Week (“DDW”), which is scheduled for May 18 to 21, 2019. Draft protocol synopses for the Lucid Diagnostics Inc. sponsored clinical studies have been completed based upon input from former FDA officials retained through a leading regulatory consulting firm. Soon thereafter, we expect to file a pre-submission package with the FDA and secure a meeting date to discuss its clinical data requirements for a de novo or Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) pathway submission to support the EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ second phase goal of a specific indication for widespread BE screening using EsoCheck™ Technology.

We have advanced, in partnership with our design and contract manufacturing partners, our PortIO product from concept to working prototypes, benchtop, animal, and cadaver testing, commercial design and development, verification and validation testing. We are pursuing an FDA clearance for use in patients with a need for vascular access up to seven days, under “de novo classification” of section 513(f)2 of the FDCA. The broader “seven days” clearance is being pursued in discussion with FDA following our previous initial submission to the FDA for a 510(k) premarket notification for use in patients only requiring 24-hour emergency type vascular access. The FDA-requested long-term GLP animal study implants and explants have been completed as has supplemental acute animal and cadaver studies designed to support the findings of the GLP study. The data will be submitted to the FDA once pathologic analysis of the implant sites is completed. Based on encouraging animal data, we are planning a long-term first-in-human (“FIH”) series in dialysis patients in Colombia, South America and intend to fulfill the likely FDA request for human clinical data with an “outside-of-United States” (“OUS”) study in New Zealand, CE Mark submission is scheduled for later this year, and we continue to explore potential strategic partnerships including acquisition of PortIO. Of significance toward our belief PortIO will one day become the answer to solve many of the current drawbacks intravenous access devices regularly encounter, our supplemental animal testing demonstrated PortIO was effective as a long-term vascular access device for the infusion of a daily dose of antibiotics over 60 days and also demonstrated PortIO remained patent in another animal despite not being accessed for 60 days.
 
We have advanced the development of our DisappEAR product in partnership with our design and contract manufacturing partners and our academic partners at Tufts University and Harvard Medical School. Our DisappEAR™ animal study to evaluate resorption rates was initiated in December 2018 with successful implants of machined silk ear tubes. The initial set of explants at three months look excellent and are currently undergoing pathologic analysis. Upon completion, data from this animal study will be used to support a planned FDA 510(k) submission later in 2019.
 
We have advanced the design and development of the NextFlo™ device, including a redesign which dramatically simplifies the product, lowers the projected cost of goods and expands its application to routine inpatient infusion sets, resulting in a proof of concept. NextFlo has generated favorable bench-top data, demonstrating it is able to passively adjust its resistance and deliver constant flow across a wide, clinically-relevant pressure range. The project has moved into the industrial and human factors design phase, whereby the technology will be incorporated into a standard intravenous infusion set. Full design verification and validation testing will follow to support an FDA 510(k) submission later this year and we believe will be limited to bench-top testing. Demonstration of this groundbreaking technology to interested strategic partners will commence soon and proceed in parallel with the regulatory process.
 
We have completed initial design work on the first product in the NextCath™ product line, completed head-to-head testing of retention forces, comparing our working prototype to several competing products, which has validated our approach and advanced the commercial design and development process focusing on optimizing the self-anchoring helical portion as well as cost of materials and manufacturing processes.
 
We are evaluating which initial applications for our Caldus™ disposable tissue ablation technology to pursue from a clinical and commercial point-of-view and will reinitiate development activity on this product once resources are available.
 
We are evaluating a number of product opportunities and intellectual property covering a spectrum of clinical conditions, which have been presented to us by clinician innovators and academic medical centers, for consideration of a partnership to develop and commercialize these products; we are also exploring opportunities to partner with larger medical device companies to commercialize our lead products as they move towards regulatory clearance and commercialization. In this regard, we remain actively engaged with our full-service regulatory consulting partner and who is working closely with our contract design, engineering and manufacturing partners as our products advance towards regulatory submission, clearance, and commercialization.
 
We are exploring other opportunities to grow our business and enhance shareholder value through the acquisition of pre-commercial or commercial stage products and /or companies with potential strategic corporate and commercial synergies.

Corporate History
 
PAVmed Inc. was incorporated on June 26, 2014 in the State of Delaware, initially as PAXmed Inc., then on April 19, 2015, we changed our name to PAVmed Inc. - referred to herein as “PAVmed” or “the Company”. from PAXmed Inc., which was the Company’s initial name.
 
Our principal business address is One Grand Central Place, 60 East 42nd Street, Suite 4600, New York, New York 10165, and our telephone number is (212) 949-4319. Our corporate website is www.PAVmed.com.
 
Our founders include three accomplished medical device entrepreneurs: Lishan Aklog M.D., Michael J. Glennon, and Brian J. deGuzman, M.D. In 2007, they founded Pavilion Holdings Group (“PHG”), a medical device holding company with a vision to create innovative single-product medical device companies using an outsourced business model focused on capital efficiency and speed to market. Two years later PHG formed Pavilion Medical Innovations (“PMI”), a venture-backed medical device incubator. Between 2008 and 2013, PHG and PMI founded four distinct, single-product medical device companies, three of which commercialized products and one of which was acquired, each as discussed below.
 
Vortex Medical Inc., founded in 2008 with $3.5 million in capital, created the AngioVac system, designed to remove large volume clots and other undesirable intravascular material without the need for open surgery. It received its initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance 16 months after the company was founded. AngioVac was commercially launched in 2009 and the first AngioVac procedure was performed at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital later the same year. Vortex Medical marketed the AngioVac system across the United States until it was acquired in October 2012 by AngioDynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGO) for $55.0 million in guaranteed consideration. At the time of its acquisition the company was cash-flow positive, carried no debt and did not require any additional capital beyond original $3.5 million raised.
 
Saphena Medical Inc., spun out of PMI in 2013 with $3.0 million in initial capital, created the VenaPax next-generation endoscopic vessel harvest device for use during coronary artery bypass surgery, which received FDA clearance in 18 months after the company was founded. VenaPax was first commercialized at Harvard’s Massachusetts General Hospital in late 2014. VenaPax is currently being marketed across the United States.
 
Cruzar Medsystems Inc., spun out of PMI in 2013 with $2.5 million in capital, created a novel peripheral chronic total occlusion (CTO) device for use in peripheral arterial disease, which received its initial FDA 510(k) clearance in late 2015, and was first commercialized in May 2016, and is currently being marketed across the United States.
 
PAVmed was founded to adapt this model to a multi-product company with access to public capital markets. We believe this model allows us to conceive, develop and commercialize our pipeline of medical device products using significantly less capital and time than a typical medical device company, and provide a streamlined pathway to incorporate outside innovations.
 
Initial Public Offering - PAVmed Inc - April 28, 2016
 
The PAVmed Inc initial public offering (“IPO”) was consummated on April 28, 2016 under a registration statement on Form S-1 - File No. 333-203569 - declared effective January 29, 2016, and resulted in approximately $4.2 million of net cash proceeds, after deducting cash selling agent discounts and commissions and offering expenses, from the issuance of 1,060,000 units at an offering price of $5.00 per unit, with each such “IPO Unit” comprised of one share of the Company’s common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock of the Company, with such warrant referred to as a “Series W Warrant”.
 
The IPO Units were initially listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “PAVMU”, until July 27, 2016, when they ceased be listed on Nasdaq, with the underlying shares of common stock and the Series W Warrants being separately listed on Nasdaq, under the symbols of “PAVM” for the shares of common stock and “PAVMW” for the Series W Warrants.
 
Upon the issuance of the IPO Units on April 28, 2016, the 9,560,295 remaining unexercised common stock purchase warrants previously issued in private placements before the IPO were converted into identical Series W Warrants issued in the IPO. We refer to all such warrants collectively as “Series W Warrants”, inclusive of those issued in the IPO and in the pre-IPO private placements. The Series W Warrants have an exercise price of $5.00 per share, with such exercise price not subject to further adjustment, except in the event of stock dividends, stock splits or similar events affecting the common stock, are currently exercisable, and expire on January 29, 2022 or earlier upon redemption by the Company, under certain conditions.

Regulatory Events
 
On November 21, 2018 our majority-owned subsidiary Lucid Diagnostics Inc. filed a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the FDA for the EsoCheck™ Cell Collection Device™ - EsoCheck™ CCD™ - which was accepted for substantive review in early December 2018. Subsequently, we received an initial response from the FDA in late January 2019. This Additional Information (“AI”) letter requested additional head-to-head effectiveness data relative to previously cleared esophageal cell collection devices. We have discussed this request with the FDA reviewer and will be submitting existing human cell count data of EsoCheck™ CCD™ vs. endoscopic brushings collected from the ongoing NIH trial to fulfill this request. The AI letter also requested some additional technical data related to the manufacturing and verification and validation testing of the EsoCheck™ CCD™ which will be ready for submission shortly.
 
On August 22, 2018 we were notified by the lead FDA branch reviewing the 510(k) premarket notification submission for CarpX™ the lead branch had not reached a consensus with the consulting branch within the review period allotted under the FDA’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, the lead branch recommended we take the appropriate steps to extend the review process through resubmission of the 510(k) premarket notification following an in-person pre-submission meeting which was conducted on January 7, 2019. During this meeting, the FDA recommended clinical testing to definitively document CarpX procedural safety in humans and indicated data from a properly structured clinical study outside of the U.S. would be acceptable, precluding the need to engage in the FDA’s time-consuming Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) process required for U.S. studies.

Debt Refinancing - Issue of Senior Secured Convertible Note & Repayment of Senior Secured Note - December 2018
 
In a private placement transaction with an institutional investor, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement under which we issued a Senior Secured Convertible Note, with an issue date of December 27, 2018, a contractual maturity date of December 31, 2020, a face value principal of $7.75 million, and a stated interest rate of 7.875% per annum - referred to as the “Senior Convertible Note”. At the election of the Holder, the Senior Convertible Note may be converted into shares of common stock of the Company.
 
The Senior Convertible Note proceeds were $7.0 million after payment of $750,000 of lender fees. The Company incurred total offering costs of $614,940, inclusive of the payment of a $455,000 placement agent fee and legal fees.
 
On December 27, 2018, concurrent with the issue of the Senior Convertible Note, we repaid-in-full the previously issued Senior Secured Note, inclusive of the total outstanding principal payable and the accrued but unpaid interest expense payable as of December 27, 2018, with such repayment comprised of a $5.0 million cash payment and the issue of 600,000 shares of our common stock to the lender, Scopia Holdings LLC. The Sr Secured Note had a contractual maturity date of June 30, 2019, with such maturity date not subject-to any early repayment provisions. See below for further information with respect to the Senior Secured Note.
 
The Senior Convertible Note requires bi-monthly payments, with such payments due and payable on each of the 15th calendar day of each month and the Last Trading Day of each month, with the first bi-monthly payment date of January 15, 2019 and the last bi-monthly payment date of December 31, 2020. The bi-monthly payments have two components: a bi-monthly “Installment Repayment” which commences June 28, 2019 through Dec 31, 2020, and a bi-monthly “Non-Installment Payment” which commences Jan 15, 2019 through the Dec 31, 2020. The bi-monthly Installment Repayments are prescribed and the bi-monthly Non-Installment Repayments are a function of the remaining Senior Convertible Note face value principal outstanding.
 
As noted, at the election of the Holder, the Senior Convertible Note may be converted into shares of common stock of the Company. The Holder may make the conversion election at any time after the December 27, 2018 issue date at an initial contractual stated conversion price of $1.60 per share of common stock of the Company. The conversion price per share is subject-to adjustment for the effect of stock dividends, stock splits, or similar events affecting the common stock of the Company - i.e. “plain vanilla standard anti-dilution provisions”. The conversion price may also be adjusted: if we issue or agree to issue any variable rate securities, in which case the Holder shall be entitled to substitute the variable price for the initial stated conversion price; or if certain Events of Default occur, as defined, in which case the Holder is entitled to convert all or a portion of the Senior Convertible Note at the lower of (i) the actual conversion price then in effect or (ii) 80% of the market price of the Company’s common stock, as defined, but not lower than a floor price of $0.19 per share.

Pursuant to the Tufts Patent License Agreement, the Licensors granted us the exclusive right and license to certain patents owned or controlled by the Licensors in connection with the development and commercialization of antibiotic-eluting resorbable ear tubes based on a proprietary aqueous silk technology. Upon execution of the Tufts Patent License Agreement, we paid the Licensors a $50,000 up-front non-refundable payment. The Tufts Patent License Agreement also provides for payments by us to the Licensors upon the achievement of certain product development and regulatory clearance milestones as well as royalty payments on net sales upon the commercialization of products developed utilizing the licensed patents.

Our Business Model
 
In contrast to pharmaceuticals and other life science technologies, which typically require long and capital-intensive paths to translate cellular or biochemical processes into commercially-viable therapeutics or diagnostics, we believe that medical devices have the potential to move much more rapidly from concept to commercialization with significantly less capital investment. Many commercially successful medical devices are often elegant solutions to important and prevalent clinical problems. Most medical device companies, however, are not structurally or operationally equipped to fulfill this potential. According to a report by Josh Makower, M.D., Consulting Professor of Medicine at Stanford University, the typical medical device company will spend over $31.0 million and take approximately five years to develop and commercialize a product through the FDA’s 510(k) pathway and over $100.0 million and seven or more years through the FDA’s Premarket Approval (“PMA”) pathway.
 
Prior to forming PAVmed, our leadership team established a model to realize this potential in single-product companies by advancing medical device products from concept to commercialization using significantly less capital and time than a typical medical device company. When previously applied to single-product venture backed companies, the model utilized a virtual business structure. PAVmed’s structure enables us to retain the model’s tight focus on capital and time efficiency and the core elements which drive efficiency, including limited infrastructure and low fixed costs, while taking advantages of the economies of scale and flexibility inherent in a multi-product company.
 
Project Selection
 
A key element of our model is the project selection process. We choose projects to develop and commercialize based on characteristics which contribute to a strong commercial opportunity. We place a heavy emphasis on medical device products with the potential for high-margins and high-impact in attractive markets without regard to the target specialty or clinical area.
 
Our project selection process begins with the identification of an unmet clinical need. We seek prevalent medical conditions where we believe an opportunity exists to advance the care of the patient through improvements in existing technologies or the introduction of new platform technologies. In the current healthcare environment, this usually means our products must be less invasive and more cost effective. We select projects which we believe have the potential to lessen procedural invasiveness and/or the opportunity to shift care from the surgical operating room to lower-cost venues such as the interventional suite or the ambulatory setting. We expect our products to decrease complications, hospital stays, recovery times and indirect costs associated with a patient’s loss of productivity.
 
Additional characteristics which impact a project’s commercial opportunity are its technology, regulatory and reimbursement profiles. We typically select projects with strong intellectual property position, low to moderate technological complexity, low to moderate manufacturing costs and primarily disposable products do not require significant capital equipment.
 
One of the most important features we consider is the project’s regulatory pathway, both in the U.S. and internationally. The FDA’s less arduous 510(k) pathway requires us to demonstrate our product is safe and substantially equivalent to FDA-cleared predicates. The FDA’s costlier and more prolonged PMA pathway requires us to demonstrate our product is safe and effective through randomized clinical studies. A product which is eligible for the 510(k) pathway will require substantially less capital and time than one that requires full PMA clearance. With all our products we are very aggressive about identifying what we believe are the quickest paths to regulatory clearance, paying very careful attention to selection of the best predicates and references as well as careful attention to precisely crafting the primary indications for use language. Although we favor products eligible for the FDA’s 510(k) pathway, with or without clinical safety studies, we may also pursue PMA pathway products with large addressable markets, or in the case of one of our lead products, PortIO™, pursue classification under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, also referred to as de novo classification, which could be more rigorous than the 510(k) pathway, but generally require substantially less time and resources than a PMA pathway. We have a variety of options to commercialize such products more efficiently by initially, or even exclusively, targeting European or emerging markets which have shorter, less costly regulatory pathways for such projects. We also attempt to identify narrower applications and indications with lower regulatory hurdles will allow us to start commercializing our product, while broader applications and indications with higher hurdles move through the regulatory process.
 
The project’s reimbursement profile, both in the U.S. and internationally, is another very important component of the project’s commercial opportunity. We prefer projects with existing reimbursement codes, the opportunity to seek reimbursement under higher-value surgical procedure codes or the potential to seek reimbursement under narrow, product-specific codes as opposed to bundled procedure codes.

Development and Commercialization Processes
 
Once we add a project to our pipeline, we map out development and commercialization processes specifically tailored to the product seeking to optimize capital and time efficiency and maximize value creation. The model emphasizes parallel development processes, such as engineering, quality, regulatory, supply chain, and manufacturing, utilizing outsourced, best-in-class process experts on an as-needed basis. We initially select the shortest, most-efficient path to commercialization of a safe and effective first-generation product. We then proceed with iterative product development based on real-life product performance and user feedback.
 
We intend to continue to utilize outsourced best-in-class process experts. We have strong relationships with a network of experts in design engineering, regulatory affairs, quality systems, supply chain management and manufacturing, including many with highly specialized skills in areas critical to our current and future pipeline. We will not be reluctant, however, to in-source certain heavily utilized process experts when and if we decide such a move will enhance our ability to execute on our strategy. As we grow, we expect to maintain a lean management infrastructure while expanding our bandwidth primarily with skilled project managers.
 
Although the PHG and PMI companies were created with a credible path to self-commercialization, they were fundamentally “built to sell.” We believe our structure will enhance our flexibility to commercialize our products compared to these and other single-product, development-stage companies. Each of our products generally follow one of three commercialization pathways. For certain products with one or more natural strategic acquirers such as PortIO and NextFlo, we may seek an early acquisition of the product prior to or soon after regulatory clearance, providing us with a source of non-dilutive capital. For certain groundbreaking high-margin products with large market opportunities such as CarpX™ and the EsoCheck™ Technology, we retain the flexibility to fully commercialize our products for the foreseeable future. For certain other high-volume, lower sale price products such as DisappEAR, we may seek to co-market them with strategic partners through sales and distribution agreements. We may also choose to monetize products through licensing agreements or the sale of the products’ underlying technology if consistent with our broader business strategy. For products we choose to commercialize ourselves, we may do through a network of independent U.S. medical distributors. We eventually may, however, choose to build (or obtain through a strategic acquisition) our own sales and marketing team, initially utilizing a hybrid model with national /regional sales management of independent distributors moving towards direct sales as warranted. As our pipeline grows, we may choose to jointly commercialize subsets of related products which target certain medical specialties or healthcare locations
 
Research and development expenses are recognized in the period they are incurred and consist principally of internal and external expenses incurred for the research and development of our products. We incurred approximately $9.1 million in cumulative research and development expenses from June 26, 2014 (inception) through December 31, 2018, inclusive of approximately $4.3 million and $2.6 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue development of our products. Our current research and development activities are focused principally on obtaining FDA approval and clearance and initializing commercialization of the lead products in our product portfolio pipeline - CarpX™, EsoCheck™ and PortIO™ - and advancing DisappEAR™ and NextFlo through development. The research and development activities on the other portfolio products is commensurate with available sufficient capital resources. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Results of Operations, herein below, for a further discussion of research and development expenses.

Our Products Pipeline
 
Since our inception, we have conceived and developed a pipeline of products which fulfill our selection criteria. Our five lead products provide groundbreaking approaches to carpal tunnel syndrome (CarpX™), precancerous conditions of the esophagus (EsoCheck™), vascular access (PortIO™), pediatric ear infections (DisappEAR™) and medical infusions (NextFlo™). The company is also developing innovative products in other areas, such as catheters and tissue ablation, while seeking to further expand its pipeline through engagements with clinician innovators and leading academic medical centers. We will need to receive regulatory clearance in order to commercialize these products. Additional capital will be required for us to commercialize these products and/or pursue additional regulatory clearances. Further, there is no assurance any of our products will ever be commercialized or, if commercialized, will achieve the results we expect. In December 2016, we filed a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the FDA for our first product, PortIO™, and in October 2017 decided instead to pursue classification under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, also referred to as de novo classification under a broader indication, for up to seven days and consequently filed its de novo pre-submission package with the FDA for PortIO™ on October 30, 2017. Furthermore, on November 27, 2017 we filed a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the FDA for our CarpX™ minimally invasive device designed to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. As discussed above, on November 21, 2018, our majority-owned subsidiary Lucid Diagnostics Inc. filed a 510(k) premarket notification submission with the FDA for our EsoCheck™ CCD™. We anticipate additional submissions in 2019 and beyond for the products in our pipeline.
 
Our product pipeline is dynamic, and we adjust our development and commercialization plans based on real-time progress, changes in market conditions, commercial opportunity and availability of resources. As such, we have designated CarpX™, EsoCheck™ , PortIO™, NextFlo™, and DisappEAR™ as lead products which are moving aggressively towards regulatory clearance and commercialization.

CarpX™ - Percutaneous Device to Treat Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
 
The Market. Carpal tunnel syndrome (“CTS”) is the most common cumulative trauma disorder and accounts for over half of all occupational injuries. The carpal tunnel is an anatomic compartment in the wrist through which tendons and the median nerve pass. Cumulative trauma leads to inflammation which manifests itself clinically through its compressive effect on the median nerve, resulting in motor and sensory dysfunction in the hand. A survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported 2.5% of U.S. adults, or approximately five million individuals, have CTS and about 600,000 surgical procedures are performed annually for CTS. According to the CDC, CTS accounts for two million office visits per year. According to the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research CTS costs the U.S. over $20.0 billion in annual workers’ compensation costs.
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. Patients who have failed to improve with physical therapy or other non-invasive treatments are candidates for interventions which seek to relieve the compression of the median nerve by cutting the transverse carpal ligament, which forms the superficial wall of the carpal tunnel. Traditional surgical approaches are effective, but invasive and must be performed in a surgical operating room. Endoscopic approaches are less invasive, but are more technically challenging, more expensive and have been associated with higher complication rates. These approaches still require a surgical incision and some surgical dissection before the endoscope is passed into the carpal tunnel. Two less-invasive devices are currently on the market. One device attempts to use transillumination to guide blind passage of a protected knife and the other passes a saw-like device blindly or by ultrasound guidance. Technical limitations have hindered market acceptance of these devices.
 
Our Solution. We are developing CarpX as a minimally invasive device to treat CTS. We believe our device will allow the physician to relieve the compression on the median nerve without an open incision or the need for endoscopic or other imaging equipment. To use our device, the operator first advances a guidewire through the carpal tunnel under the ligament. Our device is then advanced over the wire and positioned in the carpal tunnel under ultrasonic and/or fluoroscopic guidance. When the balloon is inflated it creates tension in the ligament positioning the cutting electrodes underneath it and creates space within the tunnel, providing anatomic separation between the target ligament and critical structures such as the median nerve. Radiofrequency energy is briefly delivered to the electrodes, rapidly cutting the ligament and relieving the pressure on the nerve. We believe our device will be significantly less invasive than existing treatments. We also believe it will allow for more extensive lateral dissection within the tunnel and more reliable division of the ligament, resulting in lower recurrence rates than some of the endoscopic approaches. We have filed a nonprovisional patent application and advanced, in partnership with our design and contract manufacturing partners, our CarpX™ product from concept to working prototypes, completed successful benchtop and cadaver testing confirming the device consistently cuts the transverse carpal ligament, as well as commercial design and development, and performed pre-submission verification and validation testing.
On November 27, 2017, we filed with the Federal Food and Drug Administration, or the “FDA,” a premarket notification submission for CarpX under section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the “FDCA,” using a commercially available carpel tunnel release device as a predicate. On July 24, 2018, the FDA received our response to its requests-for-information regarding non-clinical support for our 510(k) premarket notification submission. Our July 24, 2018 response to the FDA included results from an animal study, which documented the device’s bipolar electrode design results in minimal spread of thermal energy – less than one-millimeter thermal injury by pathologic analysis - and no increase in tissue temperatures except directly over the cutting electrodes. Our July 24, 2018 response to the FDA also included additional physician usability testing, wherein each of the hand surgeons successfully performed the CarpX procedure multiple times in cadavers. On August 22, 2018 we were notified by the lead FDA branch reviewing the 510(k) premarket notification submission it had not reached a consensus with the consulting branch within the review period allotted under the FDA’s rules and regulations. Accordingly, the lead branch recommended we take the appropriate steps to extend the review process through resubmission of the 510(k) premarket notification following an in-person pre-submission meeting which was conducted on January 7, 2019. During this meeting, the FDA recommended clinical testing to definitively document CarpX procedural safety in humans and indicated data from a properly structured clinical study outside of the U.S. would be acceptable, precluding the need to engage in the time-consuming FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) process required for U.S. studies. PAVmed offered to amend its previously planned first-In-human (“FIH”) clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03747510) in New Zealand to meet this clinical testing recommendation and postponed the initiation of the amended study until study parameters were finalized with the FDA. We recently reached a consensus with the FDA on the parameters of the CarpX FIH safety study, including both pre-operative and post-operative electrodiagnostic testing to document device safety. The CarpX FIH safety study is a single-arm, two-center, two-surgeon, 20-patient study of the CarpX procedure in carpal tunnel syndrome patients, with a device safety primary endpoint defined as the absence of certain serious device-related adverse events over a limited 90-day follow-up period. Patients are currently undergoing pre-operative assessment and CarpX procedures are expected soon thereafter, subject-to customary procedure consents timely completed by each patient. Additionally, we will be preparing to submit CarpX for CE Mark clearance in Europe.
 
Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will have the potential to (i) decrease procedural costs by shifting the procedure from the operating room to an office setting while retaining similar reimbursement to traditional surgical approaches, (ii) reduce post-operative pain, (iii) accelerate the patient’s return to full activity and (iv) lower the threshold for intervention for patients “suffering in silence” who chose to delay surgery until symptoms become debilitating. Our device may also be applicable to other clinical situations where percutaneous division of a fibrous structure can be used for therapeutic effect such as plantar fasciitis and extremity compartment syndromes resulting from trauma or ischemia.

EsoCheck™ Technology - Non-Invasive Cell Collection Device & DNA Biomarkers to Detect Esophageal Cancer Precursor
 
The Market. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma, or “EAC,” the most common cancer of the esophagus, has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Its prognosis, however, remains dismal, with less than 20% of patients surviving five years. We are pursuing the development of the EsoCheck™ Technology to provide the estimated 50 million at-risk patients a non-invasive, less costly test to detect Barrett’s Esophagus, so as to enable treatment of esophageal cancer at an early stage. The primary cause of the EAC form of esophageal cancer is Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or “GERD,” commonly known as chronic heartburn or acid reflux, wherein stomach acid refluxes into the esophagus. GERD affects 20-40% of Western adult populations, according to published epidemiological data. The repeated exposure to stomach acid can lead to pre-cancerous changes in the esophagus lining, a condition known as “Barrett’s Esophagus.”
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. Nearly all patients diagnosed with EAC have evidence of previously undetected Barrett’s Esophagus (“BE”). If detected before the EAC esophagus cancer develops, BE can be successfully treated, usually with non-surgical approaches. Heartburn symptoms, commonly seen in patients with acid reflux with or without BE, can easily be treated with over-the counter medications, while endoscopy, the current standard-of-care diagnostic test, is expensive, invasive, and requires sedation. As a result, wide screening for BE is not practical or cost-effective.
 
Our Solution. In May 2018, our majority-owned subsidiary, Lucid Diagnostics Inc., entered into a license agreement, the “EsoCheck™ License Agreement,” with Case Western Reserve University, or “CWRU,” pursuant to which Lucid Diagnostics Inc. obtained the worldwide intellectual property rights to the “EsoCheck™ Technology”. The EsoCheck™ Technology, which is intended for use to detect BE, a primary precursor to esophageal cancer, includes the following proprietary technologies:
 

● | “EsoCheck™ Cell Collection Device™ - EsoCheck™ CCD™. In a five-minute office-based test, the patient swallows the EsoCheck™ CCD™, which is a vitamin-sized silicone-covered capsule containing a small inflatable balloon attached to a thin catheter, which swabs the target area for cell collection as the catheter is withdrawn. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ - The collected cell sample can then be tested against a panel of the proprietary EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ methylated DNA biomarkers, which have recently been shown to be highly accurate in detecting BE. 

 
The first phase of our EsoCheck™ Technology regulatory and commercialization strategy included the November 21, 2018 submission of our EsoCheck™ CCD™ FDA 510(k) clearance application which was accepted for substantive review in early December 2018. The EsoCheck EsoGuard™ methylated DNA biomarker laboratory test is undergoing a battery of tests to secure CLIA certification which will allow it to be marketed under a Laboratory Developed Test, or “LDT,” designation without further regulatory review. In anticipation of these milestones we have engaged a leading consulting firm with expertise in securing reimbursement for LDT’s and we have begun the process to apply for EsoCheck™ Technology related codes through the AMA’s Proprietary Laboratory Analysis - “AMA PLA” - process upon receiving LDT designation for EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™.
 
The second phase of our EsoCheck™ Technology regulatory and commercialization strategy seeks a specific indication for widespread BE screening through the FDA’s PMA medical device pathway, based on existing American College of Gastroenterology (“ACG”) guidelines, which recommend BE screening for up 20 million GERD patients. We have positioned resources to allow our EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ second phase strategy to move forward in an accelerated fashion.
 
The multi-center NIH-funded clinical trial comparing EsoCheck™ CCD™ plus EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ to endoscopy has enrolled 200 patients and interim results have been accepted for presentation at the major annual gastroenterology meeting, Digestive Diseases Week (“DDW”), scheduled for May 18 through 21, 2019. Draft protocol synopses for the Lucid Diagnostics Inc sponsored clinical studies have been completed and will be finalized in the near future at an important meeting with former FDA officials retained through a leading regulatory consulting firm.
 
Soon thereafter, we expect to file a pre-submission package with the FDA and secure a meeting date to discuss its clinical data requirements for a de novo or Pre-Market Approval (PMA) pathway submission to support the EsoCheck™ EsoGuard™ second phase’s goal of a specific indication for widespread BE screening using the EsoCheck™ Technology.

PortIO™ - Implantable Intraosseous Vascular Access Device
 
The Market. Vascular access devices, including peripheral intravenous catheters, central venous lines, peripherally inserted central catheters, tunneled catheters or implanted ports, are used to deliver various medications, fluids, blood products, nutrition or other therapeutic agents to patients with a wide variety of clinical conditions over multiple episodes spanning a period of days to weeks to months. A report by iData Research Group estimates the market for such devices to be several billion dollars annually. The market is moderately fragmented and highly commoditized, with slight premium pricing for modest features, including anti-infective coating, anti-thrombotic properties, tip location and power injector compatibility.
 
Current Devices and their Limitations Many chronically ill patients requiring long-term vascular access devices have poor or no central venous access as a result of repeated instrumentation of the veins or the presence of pacemaker and defibrillator leads, resulting in thrombosis or scarring. In addition, patients with renal failure need preservation of their peripheral and central veins for future dialysis access. The decades-old core technologies underlying currently available long-term vascular access devices have several limitations which relate directly to the intravascular component of the device. Up to 10% of such devices become infected, which can lead to costly and severe complications and even death (van de Wetering, Cochrane Database 2013). Since they are in constant contact with the blood stream, current devices require regular flushes to clear stagnant blood and prevent thrombus formation and occlusion. Despite these maneuvers, up to one-third of long-term vascular access devices become occluded at some point during their implantation period (Baskin, et al., Lancet 2009) and the resulting clot can dislodge as an embolism causing further downstream complications. This complication requires treatment with clot-dissolving agents or removal and implantation of a new device at an alternative site which in turn can lead to additional complications. Finally, most long-term vascular access devices require surgical insertion and removal, radiographic confirmation of tip placement and careful handling by trained clinicians to prevent the introduction of air into the circulation.
 
Our Solution. The intraosseous route provides a means for infusing fluids, medications and other substances directly into the bone marrow cavity which communicates with the central venous circulation via nutrient and emissary veins. This route is well established, having been used for decades in a variety of settings including trauma, especially military trauma, and pediatric emergencies. It has been shown to be bioequivalent to the intravenous route. Complication rates are low and there are few contraindications. Recently, physicians have expanded the use of the intraosseous route to non-emergent clinical scenarios. Currently available intraosseous devices pass through the skin into the bone and are therefore limited to short term use. We have developed a novel, implantable intraosseous vascular access device which does not require accessing the central venous system and does not have an indwelling intravascular component. It is designed to be highly resistant to occlusion and, we believe, may not require regular flushing. It features simplified, near-percutaneous insertion and removal, without the need for surgical dissection or radiographic confirmation. It provides a near limitless number of potential access sites and can be used in patients with chronic total occlusion of their central veins. We believe the absence of an intravascular component will result in a very low infection rate.
 
We have filed a final nonprovisional patent application and advanced, in partnership with our design and contract manufacturing partners, our PortIO™ product from concept to working prototypes, benchtop, animal, and cadaver testing, commercial design and development, verification and validation testing, and an initial submission to the FDA for 510(k) market clearance for use in patients requiring 24-hour emergency type vascular access.
 
After further discussion with the FDA, we decided to pursue a broader clearance for use in patients with a need for vascular access up to seven days under section 513(f)2 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, also referred to as de novo classification. We filed a de novo pre-submission package with the FDA which was followed by an in-person meeting on January 9, 2018 to discuss the risk assessment and proposed mitigation testing for the de novo application. Based on their recommendations, the FDA-requested long-term GLP animal study implants and explants have been completed as has supplemental acute animal and cadaver studies designed to support the findings of the GLP study. The data will be submitted to FDA once pathologic analysis of the implant sites is completed.
 
Of significance toward our belief PortIO will one day become the answer to solve many of the current drawbacks intravenous access devices regularly encounter, our supplemental animal testing demonstrated PortIO was effective as a long-term vascular access device. In parallel with the GLP animal study, we also conducted a long-term pilot study to assess PortIO function and patency for up to 60 days. PortIO devices were used to infuse antibiotics, saline, albumin and blood at various intervals and over various implant durations. The device with the longest implant duration was simply left in place, untouched, with no infusions or flushes for a period of 62 days following implantation. Prior to removal, it’s function and patency were confirmed by injecting intravenous contrast material and visualizing brisk flow into the bone marrow and central veins. There was no evidence of clots, bony ingrowth or infection in any device or implant site. Based on this encouraging animal data, we are planning a long-term FIH series during in dialysis patients in Colombia, South America with a 90-day implant duration and intend to fulfill the likely FDA request for human clinical data with an outside-of-United States (OUS”) study in New Zealand, The CE Mark submission is scheduled for later this year.

DisappEAR™ - Antimicrobial Resorbable Ear Tubes
 
The Market. Each year up to one million children, generally between the ages of 2 and 5, with persistent ear infections (otitis media) or middle ear fluid collections (effusions) undergo placement of metal, plastic or latex bilateral ear tubes to ventilate and drain the middle ear. This procedure, formally known as bilateral tympanostomy, is the most common pediatric surgical procedure in the United States. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia. After the procedure, the patients are typically treated with a one-week course of antibiotic ear drops administered twice a day. The tubes are regularly monitored and allowed to remain in place for at least one year until the natural drainage pathway of the middle ear (the Eustachian tube) opens up as the child grows and the surrounding tonsillar tissue regresses. A second procedure, again under general anesthesia, is often needed to remove the tubes once they are no longer needed or if they become dislodged and do not fall out of the ear canal on their own. Although the tubes themselves are marketed as a moderately priced item, the antibiotics course can cost $300 or more. Thus, there is a significant market opportunity of up to $300 million for a system which can replace the post-operative antibiotic drops and reduce the need for future procedures.
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. As noted, the currently available pediatric ear tubes require general anesthesia for insertion and removal and a course of antibiotic ear drops. The ear drops can be quite difficult for parents to administer in children of younger age which can lead to poor compliance. Furthermore, tube dislodgement is not uncommon. When the tube dislodges into the ear canal it can get embedded in wax and lead to inflammation, obscured visualization of the ear drum, pain and bleeding. When the tube dislodges into the middle ear, where the fragile bones that transduce sound to the inner ear reside, parents and physicians become concerned about long-term damage and hearing loss. As a result, both situations usually require a second procedure, again under general anesthesia. Up to 50% of patients undergoing ear tube placement require a second procedure.
 
Our Solution. In November 2016, we entered in a licensing agreement with a group of leading academic institutions, including Tufts University and two Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals - Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts General Hospital. The agreement provides PAVmed with an exclusive worldwide license for the life of the underlying patents to develop and commercialize antimicrobial resorbable ear tubes based on a proprietary aqueous silk technology conceived and developed at these institutions. One of the visionaries behind this technology, Christopher J. Hartnick, M.D., Professor of Otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School and Chief of Pediatric Otolaryngology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts General Hospital, joined our Medical Advisory Board in October 2016. We are working closely with Dr. Hartnick and Dr. David Kaplan, Stern Family Professor of Engineering, Chair of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Director of Bioengineering and Biotechnology Center at Tufts University. We have committed to a timeline with certain milestones on the path to commercialization. Once commercialized, the institutions will receive royalties based on revenue and a portion of certain additional proceeds from the sale or sublicensing of the technology to a third party. We believe the resorbable ear tubes will eliminate the need for a second procedure to remove retained or dislodged tubes in most patients. Having the device embedded with antimicrobial agents will eliminate the difficult-to administer post-procedure antibiotic ear tube regimen. Our partners previously completed successful animal studies using working prototypes of the device. Our DisappEAR™ animal study to evaluate resorption rates was initiated in December 2018 with successful implants of machined silk ear tubes. The initial set of explants at three months look excellent and are currently undergoing pathologic analysis. Upon completion, data from this animal study will be used to support a planned FDA 510(k) submission later in 2019. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will garner premium pricing based on improving compliance and eliminating the significant cost related to the post-procedure antibiotic regimen, the need for second procedure and fewer complications.

NextCath™ - Self-Anchoring Short-Term Catheters
 
The Market. A wide variety of short-term catheters are used in clinical practice to infuse fluids, medications or other substances into a vein or other structures, to monitor physiologic parameters and to drain visceral organs or cavities. Interventional radiology catheters, in particular, are widely used to drain various structures and cavities including the pleural space, obstructed kidneys and abscess cavities. There is an increasing appreciation, however, of the importance of catheter securement in preventing complications of all indwelling catheters. There has been an explosion of separate propriety devices marketed to facilitate catheter securement. A report by iData Research Group estimates the catheter securement market to be approximately $4.0 billion annually.
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. Currently marketed short-term catheters are not self-anchoring, they have been traditionally anchored to the skin with simple tape or some other adhesive incorporated into the sterile dressing. According to a report by Dr. Gregory J. Schears, a pediatric anesthesiologist and expert on catheter securement, both microscopic and macroscopic movements from inadequate catheter securement can lead to complications including vascular injury and dislodgment. Catheter dislodgement leads to increased pain, increased costs and potentially more serious complications arising from interruption of critical treatments or bleeding. These of course can also adversely impact quality of care. Monitoring catheter patency and security and reinserting dislodged catheters is labor intensive. Many types of catheters are sutured to the skin, a process which leads to increased pain and exposure to needle sticks. Dislodgement of interventional radiology catheters are a significant concern since they can lead to serious complications and may require another visit to the procedural suite to replace or reposition the catheter. A wide variety of catheter securement devices are currently marketed. Some have been shown to decrease complications relative to traditional techniques but add cost and complexity to the process.
 
Our Solution. We are developing self-anchoring short-term catheters which do not require suturing, traditional anchoring techniques or costly add-on catheter securement devices. We are initially focusing on interventional radiology catheters which are less commoditized and result in significantly greater risk when dislodged. Our self-anchoring technique, however, is applicable to most, if not all, short-term catheters. The self-anchoring mechanism is integral to the catheter. It allows insertion with standard techniques and the use of simple clear sterile dressings. It allows the hub of the catheter to be flat and the tubing to come out eccentrically, or parallel to the skin, improving patient comfort and catheter management. We have filed a nonprovisional patent application, engaged design and contract manufacturing firms with experience in extrusions which have completed initial design work on the first product in the NextCath™ product line, and completed head-to-head testing of retention forces, comparing our working prototype to several competing products, which has validated our approach and advanced the commercial design and development process focusing on optimizing the self-anchoring helical portion as well as cost of materials and manufacturing processes. Further development of NextCath™ is subject to availability of additional financial resources. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will garner premium pricing based on fewer complications and reduced overall costs.

NextFlo™ - Highly-Accurate Disposable Infusion System
 
The Market. Each day, over one million patients receive some type of infusion and 90% of hospitalized patients receive an intravenous infusion at some point during their hospital stay. (Husch et al. Quality & Safety in Health Care 2005; 14:80-86). Unlike twenty years ago, nearly all inpatient infusions, including routine ones which do not require flow adjustment, are delivered by expensive electric infusion pumps instead of with simple gravity. An increasing number of these patients are receiving infusions of medications or other substances outside of a hospital, in ambulatory facilities and at home. In addition, disposable infusion pumps (“DIPs”) have many attractive features favor their use in these settings over outpatient electric infusion pumps. Patients tend to favor DIPs because they are small, disposable, simple to operate, easy to conceal, and allow for greater mobility. They are used to deliver medications including antibiotics, local anesthetics and opioids. According to a report by Transparency Market Research, the overall global infusion market is estimated to be over $5.0 billion annually. DIPs account for approximately 10% of this market and inpatient infusion sets for about 20%.
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. Infusion pump errors are a serious ongoing problem and represent a large share of the overall human and economic burden of medical errors. Electronic infusion pumps have become expensive, high-maintenance devices and have been plagued in recent years with recalls due to serious software and hardware problems. These pumps are designed for fine titration of infusions in complex patients such as those in a critical care setting. Using them for routine administration of medications or fluids is technological overkill. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for a simple, disposable device which can be incorporated into a standard infusion set and eliminate the need for expensive, problem-prone infusion pumps for routine inpatient infusions. In terms of outpatient infusions, currently marketed DIPs are powered by elastomeric membranes, compressed springs, compressed gas or vacuum and controlled by mechanical flow limiters. The primary limitation of DIPs is they can be highly inaccurate in actual use because they can be susceptible to changes in operating conditions (e.g. temperature, atmospheric pressure, viscosity, back pressure, partial filing and prolonged storage). As a result, their safety profiles make them unsuitable for use with medications, such as chemotherapeutics, where flow accuracy is critical to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and avoid complications. The FDA’s MAUDE database includes numerous reports of complications and even deaths as a result of DIPs infusing a particular medication too slowly or too fast. We believe there is a significant market opportunity for highly accurate disposable infusion pumps for outpatient use.
 
Our Solution. We are developing highly-accurate infusion systems with variable flow resistors. We acquired U.S. Patent 8,622,976 issued January 7, 2014 and associated U.S. and international patent applications, “System and Methods for Infusion of Fluids Using Stored Potential Energy and a Variable Flow Resistor”. We have built on the principles underlying this patent and developed a new concept whereby the variable resistor does not have to be mechanically-linked to the infusion drive mechanism. This simplifies the design and expands the range of potential follow-on products. We have performed extensive computer simulation testing on various embodiments and have demonstrated highly-accurate flow rates across a wide range of driving pressures. We have advanced the design and development of the NextFlo™ device, including a redesign which dramatically simplifies the product, lowers the projected cost of goods and expands its application to routine inpatient infusion sets, resulting in a proof of concept. NextFlo has generated favorable bench-top data, demonstrating it is able to passively adjust its resistance and deliver constant flow across a wide, clinically-relevant pressure range. The project has moved into the industrial and human factors design phase, whereby the technology will be incorporated into a standard intravenous infusion set. Full design verification and validation testing will follow to support an FDA 510(k) submission later this year and we believe will be limited to bench-top testing. Once this product is commercialized, we believe it will command a premium price over existing inpatient infusion sets and low-accuracy, DIPs. We believe infusion sets incorporating this product will permit hospitals to return to gravity and eliminating expensive infusions pumps for the most inpatient infusions. We also believe the accuracy of our device incorporated into DIPs will allow them to be used with a broader range of drugs, thereby significantly expanding the addressable market. Demonstration of this groundbreaking technology to interested strategic partners will commence soon and proceed in parallel with the regulatory process.

Caldus™ - Disposable Tissue Ablation Devices
 
The Market. Tissue ablation involves the targeted destruction of tumors or benign tissues with pathologic impact (e.g. gastrointestinal, endometrial and cardiac) using one of a variety of commercially-available ablation devices based on a specific energy source (e.g. radiofrequency, microwave, laser, ultrasound, cryoablation). With the exception of cryoablation, all of these devices act through a common pathway of cellular hyperthermia. A 2014 report by Transparency Market Research estimates the tissue ablation market generates $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion in annual revenue. One target which has not been successfully treated with ablation is fistula tracts, specifically fistula-in-ano. Up to 100,000 patients present with this condition annually. More recently, the renal nerves have been identified as a therapeutic target for ablation in patients with refractory hypertension. Despite a widely publicized clinical trial which failed to meet its endpoint, many believe renal denervation remains an attractive clinical and commercial opportunity with approximately 10 million U.S. and 100 million worldwide patients with resistant hypertension (Pimenta et al. Circulation 2012; 125-1594-96).
 
Current Devices and their Limitations. All commercially-available devices or those under development for renal denervation rely on some form of a console to generate the ablation energy. These consoles, whether sold or leased as capital equipment or incorporated into the disposable costs, represent a significant portion of the cost of the technology and the procedure. These costs can significantly impact procedural margins and marketing in emerging countries with limited biomedical staff. Another limitation of current devices is they depend on maintaining the conductivity of its energy through the tissue during the ablation period. For example, radiofrequency ablation depends on electrical conductivity to generate heat, but creating too much heat near the probe can generate charring which increases impedance and decreases the effective range of the ablation. A wide variety of technologies and techniques have been developed to accommodate the challenges of ablating across large distances using radiofrequency (e.g. multi-electrode probes, cooling, irrigation and complex power algorithms). As a result, these tissue ablation modalities typically require a complex, external console to assure the precise amount of energy is delivered to the tissue. In addition, the consoles require on-going maintenance and monitoring by the manufacturer and local facility technical staff to assure they remain safe for use in patients. This can be particularly burdensome when commercializing such devices in emerging markets where access to qualified technical personnel may be limited.
 
Our Solution. We are developing completely disposable tissue ablation devices, including for renal denervation, based on direct thermal ablation of the tissue using heated fluid. We are evaluating which initial applications for our Caldus™ disposable tissue ablation technology to pursue from a clinical and commercial point-of-view and will reinitiate development activity on this product upon resources becoming available. Once this product is commercialized, we believe our completely disposable system will have significantly lower procedural costs and higher margins than existing technologies.
 
Additional Products
 
We are evaluating a number of other product opportunities and intellectual property covering a spectrum of clinical conditions, which have been presented to us by clinician innovators and academic medical centers, for consideration of a partnership to develop and commercialize these products. We are also exploring opportunities to partner with larger medical device companies to commercialize our lead products as they move towards regulatory clearance and commercialization; we are evaluating strategic merger and acquisition opportunities which synergize with our growth strategy. Furthermore, we are exploring other opportunities to grow our business and enhance shareholder value through the acquisition of pre-commercial or commercial stage products and /or companies with potential strategic corporate and commercial synergies.

Our Implementation Strategy
 
We intend to advance our lead products towards commercialization as quickly and efficiently as possible and expand our product pipeline by advancing our conceptual phase projects through patent submission and early testing.
 
Although we will continue to conceive and develop products internally, as we grow and expand our resources, we intend to expand our pipeline with innovative products sourced from third parties. In contrast to pharmaceuticals and other life sciences technologies, medical device innovation often begins with one, or at most a few, clinicians and/or engineers identifying an unmet clinical need and proposing a technological solution to address such need. Many academic medical centers and other large institutions try to aggregate their intellectual property through technology transfer centers and, more recently, through “innovation” centers which do not merely secure and transfer intellectual property, but actually advance projects internally prior to spinning them out for eventual commercialization.
 
It is our belief, despite these efforts, only a small fraction of the potential pool of intellectual capital (i.e. the universe of individual clinicians with innovative product ideas) is participating in medical device innovation. These clinicians rarely engage in the process for a variety of reasons, including the belief they are too busy, can’t afford to divert time away from their practice or that the upfront out-of-pocket costs are too great. Other clinicians believe they lack the knowledge or connections to successfully navigate the process. Technology transfer and full-fledged innovation centers have only had modest success in getting their clinicians to bring them innovative product ideas and even less success getting these products commercialized. Even centers with extensive resources are usually limited in their ability to advance products beyond the pre-clinical phase and are dependent on a shrinking pool of early-stage medical device venture capital to bring their products to market. Furthermore, some technology transfer and innovation centers associated with not-for-profit hospitals, universities, endowments and charitable organizations may be precluded from directly engaging in commercial sales of medical devices, creating opportunities for us to commercialize and market their intellectual property.
 
Our capital and time efficient model put us in strong position to partner with innovative clinicians and academic medical centers focusing on medical device innovation. We have developed a collaboration model focused on licensing technologies for development and commercialization. Since our founding, we have been contacted by clinicians and centers inquiring about opportunities to work with us on developing and commercializing their ideas and technologies. In November 2016, we signed a definitive licensing agreement with a group of leading academic institutions, including Tufts University and two Harvard Medical School teaching hospitals - Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and Massachusetts General Hospital. The agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize antibiotic-eluting resorbable ear tubes based on a proprietary aqueous silk technology conceived and developed at these institutions, a product we have dubbed DisappEAR™. Once commercialized, the institutions will receive royalties based on revenue and a portion of certain additional proceeds from the sale or sublicensing of the technology to a third party.
 
Whether internally or externally sourced, we seek to maintain balance within our pipeline with shorter-term, lower-risk products which offer the opportunity for more rapid commercialization, generating revenue to support development of longer-term products. As each product moves through our pipeline from concept to commercialization, we continuously reassess the product’s long-term commercial potential, balance it against other products in the pipeline and re-allocate resources accordingly. As such, we expect to have much greater flexibility to move products through our pipeline based on the actual developments and the overall interests of our company. We may accelerate, decelerate, pause or abandon a product and increase or decrease resources applied to a product based on a variety of factors including available capital, shifts in the regulatory, clinical, market and/or intellectual property landscape for a particular product, the emergence of one or more products with significantly greater commercial potential, or any other factor which may impact its long-term commercial potential.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently expect to commercialize our products through a network of independent U.S. medical distributors. We focus on high-margin products which are particularly suitable to this mode of distribution. A high gross margin allows us to properly incentivize our distributors, which in turn allows us to attract the top distributors with the most robust networks in our targeted specialties. Independent distributors play an even larger role in many parts of Europe, most of Asia and emerging markets worldwide.
 
We eventually may, however, choose to build (or obtain through a strategic acquisition) our own sales and marketing team to commercialize some or all of our products if it is in our long-term interests. We may also choose to enter into distribution agreements with larger strategic partners whereby we take full responsibility for the manufacturing of our products but outsource some or all of its distribution to a partner with its own robust distribution channels. Such agreements may include regional carve outs, minimum sales volumes, margin splitting and/or an option or right of first offer to purchase the technology at a future date. As our pipeline grows, we may choose to jointly commercialize subsets of related products which target certain medical specialties or healthcare locations.

Item 1. Business - continued
Manufacturing
 
We currently have no plans to manufacture our own products because the fixed overhead costs and limited flexibility that come with owning manufacturing facilities are not consistent with our capital efficient model. The entire medical device industry, including many of its largest players, depends heavily on contract manufacturers operating in the United States and abroad. Medical device manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other authorities. Compliance with these regulations is costly and particularly onerous on small, development-phase companies. Contract manufacturers can also take advantage of significant economies of scale in terms of purchasing, machining, tooling, specialized personnel, sub-contracting or even off-shoring certain processes to lower-cost operators. These economies are simply not available to us.
 
We have relationships with many contract manufacturers, including those with specialized skills in several processes important to our devices. We expect them to have sufficient capacity to handle our manufacturing needs and anticipate our growth will be better served by deploying our resources to expand our pipeline and commercialization efforts.
 
We intend to work closely with our contract manufacturing partners to establish and manage our products’ supply chain, dual sourcing whenever possible. We expect to help them design and build our products’ manufacturing lines including subassembly, assembly, sterilization and packaging and to work closely with them to manage our quality system, to assure compliance with all regulations and to handle inspections or other queries with regulatory bodies. Our contract manufacturers have the ability to add lines and shifts to increase the manufacturing capacity of our products as our demand dictates. We may ship our products directly from our contract manufacturers, but we may also choose to utilize third-party regional warehousing and distribution services.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our business will depend on our ability to create or acquire proprietary medical device technologies to commercialize. We intend to vigorously protect our proprietary technologies’ intellectual property rights in patents, trademarks and copyrights, as available through registration in the United States and internationally. We currently have applied for or own 72 patents across 10 families of products. Patent protection and other proprietary rights are thus essential to our business. Our policy is to aggressively file patent applications to protect our proprietary technologies including inventions and improvements to inventions. We seek patent protection, as appropriate, on:

● | the product itself including all embodiments with future commercial potential; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the methods of using the product; and 
● | the methods of manufacturing the product. 

 
In addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we intend to file counterpart patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, China and other countries worldwide. Foreign filings can be cumbersome and expensive, and we will pursue such filings when we believe they are warranted as we try to balance our international commercialization plans with our desire to protect the global value of the technology.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent.
 
We intend to continuously reassess and fine-tune our intellectual property strategy in order to fortify our position in the United States and internationally. Prior to acquiring or licensing a technology from a third party, we will evaluate the existing proprietary rights, our ability to adequately obtain and protect these rights and the likelihood or possibility of infringement upon competing rights of others.
 
We will also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and/or proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants, independent contractors and other entities who may have access to proprietary information. We will generally require employees to assign patents and other intellectual property to us as a condition of employment with us. All of our consulting agreements will pre-emptively assign to us all new and improved intellectual property that arise during the term of the agreement.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used.
 
In the United States, third-party payors continue to implement initiatives that restrict the use of certain technologies to those that meet certain clinical evidentiary requirements. In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers for procedures during which our products are used. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. In the past, when the application of the formula resulted in lower payment, Congress has passed interim legislation to prevent the reductions.
 
A product’s reimbursement profile, both in the U.S. and internationally, is an important component of the product’s commercial opportunity. We prefer projects with existing reimbursement codes, the opportunity to seek reimbursement under higher-value surgical procedure codes or the potential to seek reimbursement under narrow, product-specific codes as opposed to bundled procedure codes. For those products that have high strategic value, but with less defined reimbursement, we have engaged reimbursement experts and support from industry associations to accelerate the acquisition of satisfactory reimbursement levels.
 
Competition
 
Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. We face intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major medical products companies. We may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, some of which currently are considered part of the standard of care. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are:

● | the quality of outcomes for medical conditions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
● | acceptance by surgeons and the medical device market generally;
● | ease of use and reliability; 
● | technical leadership and superiority; 
● | effective marketing and distribution; 
● | speed to market; and 
● | product price and qualification for coverage and reimbursement.



We will also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies and licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in our current and future products areas. In order to compete effectively, our products will have to achieve market acceptance, receive adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, be cost effective and be simultaneously safe and effective.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The following is a summary of the government regulations applicable to our business.
Healthcare Reform
 
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products, or for the procedures associated with the use of our products, or limit coverage of our products. The cost containment measures payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products. Alternatively, the shift away from fee-for-service agreements to capitated payment models may support the value of our products which can be shown to decrease resource utilization and lead to cost saving - for both payors and providers.
 
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is an example that has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
 
The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on Dec. 18, 2015, included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Because of the moratorium, the medical device excise tax did not apply to sales of taxable medical devices during the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017. The moratorium expired on Dec. 31, 2017. On January 22, 2018 as part of a stop gap spending bill, President Trump signed into law a moratorium for an additional two years retroactive to January 1, 2018. The tax will not go into effect until January 1, 2020.
 
In addition, the ACA implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (“PPACA”) was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will stay in effect through 2024 unless congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 took effect, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Additionally, there is no assurance the PPACA, in whole or in part, will not be repealed in the future. Any impact such a repeal would have on the medical device industry remains unclear.

FDA Regulation
 
Any product we may develop must be cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and products.
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (often referred to as a 510(k) application), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III: special controls and approval of a PMA application. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In general, the higher the classification, the greater the time and cost to obtain approval to market. There are no “standardized” requirements for approval, even within each class. For example, the FDA could grant 510(k) status, but require a human clinical trial, a typical requirement of a PMA. They could also initially assign a device Class III status but end up approving a device as a 510(k) device if certain requirements are met. The range of the number and expense of the various requirements is significant. The quickest and least expensive pathway would be 510(k) approval with just a review of existing data. The longest and most expensive path would be a PMA with extensive randomized human clinical trials. We cannot predict how the FDA will classify our products, nor predict what requirements will be placed upon us to obtain market approval, or even if they will approve our products at all.
 
To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another currently legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a currently legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a currently legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require PMA, or possibly, a de novo pathway under section 513(f)2 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act . In addition, any additional claims the Company wished to make at a later date may require a PMA. If the FDA determines the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, they will issue a Not Substantially Equivalent letter, at which point the Company must submit and the FDA must approve a PMA or issue premarket clearance using the de novo before marketing can begin.
In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) added the de novo classification pathway under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, establishing an alternate pathway to classify new devices into Class I or II that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) submission. In this process, a sponsor who receives an NSE determination may, within 30 days of receiving notice of the NSE determination, request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act.
In 2012, section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act was amended by section 607 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), to provide a second option for de novo classification. In this second pathway, a sponsor who determines there is no legally marketed device upon which to base a determination of substantial equivalence may request FDA to make a risk-based classification of the device under section 513(a)(1) of the Act without first submitting a 510(k).
 
During the review of a 510(k) submission, the FDA may request more information or additional studies and may decide the indications for which we seek approval or clearance should be limited. In addition, laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the FDA may change in the future. We cannot foresee what effect, if any, such changes may have on us.

Clinical Trials of Medical Devices
 
One or more clinical trials may be necessary to support an FDA submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE application to the FDA prior to initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing it is safe to test the device on humans and the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board (“IRB”) has approved the study.
 
During any study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. We, the FDA, or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

* | the FDA Quality Systems Regulation (QSR), which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experience associated with use of the product. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will continue to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements.
 
Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval. We expect to use contract manufacturers to manufacture our products for the foreseeable future we will therefore be dependent on their compliance with these requirements to market our products. We work closely with our contract manufacturers to assure our products are in strict compliance with these regulations.

Other U.S. Regulation
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under such laws, it is possible some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act that imposes new annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers that produces at least one product reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program and i.) If the product is a drug or biological, and it requires a prescription (or physician’s authorization) to administer; or ii.) If the product is a device or medical supply, and it requires premarket approval or premarket notification by the FDA are required to comply with the Open Payments (commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act) filing requirements under CMS. We currently do not have any products covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or Children’s Health Insurance Program as none of our products have premarket approval or clearance notification. We expect once our products receive regulatory clearance, we will be required to comply with the Sunshine Act provisions.
 
Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, and other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated.
 
Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

Federal False Claims Act
 
The False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical, device and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus noncovered uses.
 
The government may further prosecute, as a crime, conduct constituting a false claim under the False Claims Act. The False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike civil claims under the False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
International Regulation
 
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. We may be subject to regulations and product registration requirements in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
European Union
 
The European Union or EU will require a CE mark certification or approval in order to market our products in the various countries of the European Union or other countries outside the United States. To obtain CE mark certification of our products, we will be required to work with an accredited European notified body organization to determine the appropriate documents required to support certification in accordance with existing medical device directive. The predictability of the length of time and cost associated with such a CE mark may vary or may include lengthy clinical trials to support such a marking. Once the CE mark is obtained, we may market our product in the countries of the EU.
European Good Manufacturing Practices
 
In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice (GMP), as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with GMP is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a Notified Body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The Competent Authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the Notified Body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.
