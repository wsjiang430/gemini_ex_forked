ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Unless otherwise stated or the context requires otherwise, references in this annual report on Form 10-K to “Digital Locations,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Digital Locations, Inc.

Overview

We are an early-stage aggregator, developer and acquirer of small cell sites and cell towers for 5G services. We intend to develop a portfolio of sites to help meet the expected demand of rapidly growing 5G networks.

To rapidly enter the market, Digital Locations plans to acquire or partner with companies that have a portfolio of real estate that could be activated to meet the demands of 5G networks. Our goal is to become a “landlord” of tomorrow’s wireless communications assets. In furtherance of our objective, on or about January 7, 2021, we closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of SmallCellSite.com, LLC, a source of more than 80,000 cell sites offered by property owners for use by wireless network operators. See “BUSINESS-Asset Purchase Agreement.”

With our purchase of SmallCellSite.com, LLC’s assets, we acquired proprietary web-based software which allows wireless carriers to access www.smallcellsite.com and search regionally for available properties that can be activated with wireless technology, producing revenue for both the site owner and Digital Locations.This aggregation of available property data reduces site acquisition timeframes for the large wireless carriers and makes it easier for them to source, validate, and activate properties.

By actively driving current property owners to list their property on smallcellsite.com, Digital Locations or its subsidiaries will receive a portion of the revenue if and when the property is activated by the carrier. Management believes that this business model greatly reduces the capital expenditure of traditional models of acquiring real estate and building wireless towers, and gives the Company a modern alternative to the development of traditional wireless small cells and towers.

On July 20, 2021, the Company became a member of the Digital Place-based Advertising Association (DPAA), the leading global trade marketing association connecting out-of-home (OOH) media with the advertising community while moving OOH to digital. We expect our membership in the DPAA to provide many business acceleration benefits, including a wide array of products and an extensive database of research, best practices and case studies; tools for planning, training and forecasting; social media amplification of news; insights on software and hardware solutions; further integration into the advertising ecosystem as part of the video everywhere conversation and marketing campaign.

On June 29, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Smartify Media (“Smartify”) to add Smartify’s locations to the Company’s small cell database. Smartify turns any storefront or physical location into a (MXP) Media Experience Platform for property owners which creates recurring revenue and media value from programmatic and local media channels. This strategic agreement between the Company and Smartify will allow Smartify to now offer incremental revenue increases to property owners by facilitating the activation of 5G on their properties.

Market Opportunity

5G wireless networks are expected to be 100 times faster than current 4G LTE networks. This will enable global scale killer applications such as self-driving cars, the Internet of things (“IOT”), mobile streaming of 4K videos, real-time hologram-based collaboration, and lag-free high-definition gaming. 

To realize this vision, many new 5G broadcast locations are needed because high frequency 5G signals cannot travel farther than 100 meters. It is estimated that more than one million new 5G cell towers or small cells must be added in the United States alone. International Data Corporation (“IDC”) expects over two million—by 2021. By comparison, the existing 2G/3G/4G network, built over many years, has just over 300,000 cell towers. Recent frequency auction activity and new innovation means that we have more potential clients for our locations.

As 5G initially rolls out in major metropolitan and suburban areas, we believe that in addition to conventional “macro” cell towers, wireless carriers will also need networks of small cell antennas dotting the country to relay signals to and from these signal-emitting macro towers. Only when these networks of small cells are deployed will customers experience the true 5G that has been marketed with blazing speed and ultra-low latency. The current method for identifying available real estate assets, negotiating leases, completing necessary zoning and permits, and installing equipment is outdated, time-consuming and costly. In order to truly fulfill the marketed performance of ultra-wide band 5G, a better system and process must be deployed.

We believe that we can disrupt the legacy process carriers use to identify and activate properties through our acquisition of www.smallcellsite.com. By using www.smallcellsite.com, we believe that Digital Locations can capitalize on providing “activation-ready” real estate assets through software it has acquired that speeds up implementation, enables a repeatable process and reduces the overall costs of small cell roll out.

FCC Eases 5G Tower Deployment

The United States government sees 5G as national agenda for economic and technological leadership in the next decade. Accordingly, in late 2018 the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) approved rules aimed at speeding up the deployment of small cells and other 5G network equipment by regulating in part the fees and timelines cities and states can impose on wireless network operators and other wireless players. The agency passed the rules with all commissioners voting in support. In addition, recent changes to the FCC Over-the Air Reception Devices (‘OTARD”) rules ensure that antennas used to distribute broadband fixed wireless services to multiple customer locations can be sited to support next-generation network deployment, including 5G. This opens the door to fixing 5G small cells to both commercial and residential locations. Previously, these types of 5G antennas were not allowed on residential structures, but we believe that these recent changes to the OTARD rules can swiftly enhance Digital Location’s plans.
Local Challenge of Cell Towers and Opportunity

While everyone wants lightning speed wireless networks, not everyone likes the appearance of cell towers on the sides of freeways or outskirts of town. While new FCC rules will make it easier to deploy new small cell antennas with less red tape, local city councils will still have a say regarding antenna aesthetics. We see this challenge as an opportunity for us to partner with regional cell tower contractors with good local government relationships to help us with our cell tower projects. Once installed, each cell tower functions as a multi-tenant tower, hosting antennas for different wireless carriers or businesses.
Competition

Many small cell antenna and tower operators conduct business in the United States, nevertheless, the market is dominated by four large cell tower companies which account for roughly $175 billion in market value: American Tower (“AMT”), Crown Castle (“CCI”), SBA Communications (“SBAC”), and Vertical Bridge. While cell towers only constitute a tiny portion of total real estate asset value in the United States, cell towers constitute disproportionately high importance in the market capitalization-weighted investible real estate indexes with AMT and CCI as the two single largest companies.

Cell tower companies primarily own "macro" communications towers that host cellular network broadcast equipment from AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint, but CCI and UNIT also have significant investments in fiber and small-cell networks. AMC and SBAC focus on macro tower sites, but each also has significant international operations. Typically viewed as growth-oriented companies that pay relatively low dividend yields but command superior growth profiles, cell tower companies are among the newest Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) sector, emerging after AMC converted to a REIT in 2012 followed by CCI in 2013 and SBAC in 2017.

Cell tower companies have been among the best-performing sectors over the past four years, powered by the network densification required by the early stages of the 5G rollout. More than any other real estate sector, cell tower ownership is highly concentrated. Cell tower companies own roughly 50-80% of the 100-150k investment-grade macro cell towers in the United States and due to this market power and significant barriers to entry, are perhaps the only real estate sector that could be classified as true price makers rather than price takers.

Cell tower companies continue to command strong competitive positioning in the telecommunications sector. Cell carriers sold off their tower assets beginning in the mid-2000s to de-lever their balance sheets and free-up capital to expand their networks. Supply growth is almost non-existent in the United States as there are significant barriers to entry through the local permitting process and due to the economics of colocation versus building single-tenant towers. The relative scarcity of cell towers, combined with the absolute necessity of these towers for cell networks, has given these companies substantial pricing power even as the number of potential tenants has dwindled down to just four national carriers over the last two decades. These companies have benefited from the increase in network spending from the four national carriers during the early stages of the 5G rollout.

Intellectual Property

As a result of the APA, we acquired proprietary web-based software which provides a system and method for identifying wireless communication assets. A provisional patent application for this technology was filed on May 31, 2017 and we were notified on or about January 11, 2021, by the United States Patent and Trademark Office that the patent will be granted.
Government Regulation

Digital Locations generally is subject to all of the governmental regulations that regulate businesses generally such as compliance with regulatory requirements of federal, state, and local agencies and authorities, including regulations concerning the environment, permits for certain activities, workplace safety, labor relations, employee rights, and government taxes. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of our business, decrease the demand for services and increase our cost of doing business. Changes in tax laws also could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. As we acquire small cell sites and towers, we will be subject to additional regulations imposed by the FCC regarding the wireless network industry. 
Corporate History

Digital Locations, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 25, 2006 as Zingerang, Inc.  On April 2, 2007, the Company changed its name to Carbon Sciences, Inc. and on September 14, 2017, the Company changed its name to Digital Locations, Inc.
Recent Transactions

On January 7, 2021, Digital Locations, SmallCellSite.com LLC, a Virginia limited liability company (“SCS”), and SmallCellSite, Inc., a newly formed Nevada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Subsidiary”) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) to acquire substantially all of the assets of SCS’s wireless communications marketing and database services business in consideration for a total purchase price of $10,000 in cash and a five-year convertible promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000 made in favor of SCS or its assignees (the “Note”).

SCS is a source of more than 80,000 cell sites offered by property owners for use by wireless network operators. Current customers include Verizon and T-Mobile Sprint.

Pursuant to the APA, SCS instructed us to assign the Note to its members as follows: $500,000 principal amount of the Note to Shervin Gerami, a holder of 50% of the membership interest of SCS, and $500,000 principal amount of the Note to Baryalai Azmi, a holder of 50% of the membership interest of SCS (the “Assigned Notes”). 

At any time after December 31, 2021, each month, each holder of the Assigned Notes may convert the principal amount of the Assigned Note into a number of shares of our common stock not exceeding five percent (5%) of the total trade volume of our common stock publicly reported for the previous calendar month at a conversion price of $0.013 per share. The Note also imposes an overall limitation on the amount of conversions to common stock that the Noteholder may effect such that it prohibits the Noteholder from beneficially owning more than 4.99% of the total issued and outstanding common stock of the Company at any time that the Note is outstanding.
