ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Independent Bank Corp. (the “Company”) is a state chartered, federally registered bank holding company headquartered in Rockland, Massachusetts that was incorporated under Massachusetts law in 1985. The Company is the sole stockholder of Rockland Trust Company (“Rockland” or the “Bank”), a Massachusetts trust company chartered in 1907. Rockland is a community-oriented commercial bank, and the community banking business is the Company’s only reportable operating segment. The community banking business is managed as a single strategic unit and derives its revenues from a wide range of banking services, including lending activities, acceptance of demand, savings, and time deposits, and investment management. At December 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $8.9 billion, total deposits of $7.4 billion, stockholders’ equity of $1.1 billion, and 1,188 full-time equivalent employees.
On September 20, 2018 the Company and Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc. (“Blue Hills Bancorp”), parent of Blue Hills Bank, signed a definitive merger agreement for the Company to acquire Blue Hills Bancorp and Rockland Trust to acquire Blue Hills Bank. The merger agreement provides that each Blue Hills Bancorp stockholder will receive 0.2308 of a share of the Company's common stock and $5.25 in cash for each share of Blue Hills Bancorp common stock. The transaction is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes and to provide a tax-free exchange for Blue Hills Bancorp stockholders for the Company common stock portion of the consideration they receive. The merger remains subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. 
On November 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of MNB Bancorp (MNB Bancorp) the parent company of The Milford National Bank and Trust Company, adding three full service bank branches in Worcester County, Massachusetts. The acquisition included the acquisition of $293.5 million in loans and the assumption of $278.2 million in deposits, each at fair value. The total deal consideration was $56.1 million and comprised of 25% cash and 75% stock consideration, which equates to 528,353 shares of the Company's common stock issued to MNB Bancorp shareholders valued at $42.5 million, and $13.6 million in cash, inclusive of cash in lieu of fractional shares.
The Company is currently the sponsor of Independent Capital Trust V, a Delaware statutory trust, Slade's Ferry Statutory Trust I, a Connecticut statutory trust, Central Bancorp Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust, and Central Bancorp Statutory Trust II, a Connecticut statutory trust, each of which was formed to issue trust preferred securities. As a result of the MNB Bancorp acquisition, the Company became the sponsor of East Main Street Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust. Subsequent to year end, the Company redeemed all outstanding debentures issued by East Main Street Trust I and is in the process of dissolving the entity. These statutory trusts are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the consolidation topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”).
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had the following corporate subsidiaries, all of which were wholly owned by the Bank and included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements:

• | Five Massachusetts security corporations, namely Rockland Borrowing Collateral Securities Corp., Rockland Deposit Collateral Securities Corp., Taunton Avenue Securities Corp., Goddard Ave Securities Corp. and MFLR Securities Corporation;


• | Rockland Trust Community Development Corporation, which has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Rockland Trust Community Development LLC and Rockland Trust Community Development Corporation II, and which also serves as the manager of three Limited Liability Company subsidiaries wholly-owned by the Bank, Rockland Trust Community Development III LLC, Rockland Trust Community Development IV LLC, and Rockland Trust Community Development V LLC, which are all qualified as community development entities under federal New Markets Tax Credit Program criteria;


• | Rockland MHEF Fund LLC, established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rockland Trust, created with Massachusetts Housing Equity Fund, Inc. as the third party nonmember manager and established to invest in certain low-income housing tax credit projects; 


• | RTC LIHTC Investments LLC, established to invest primarily in Massachusetts-based low-income housing tax credit projects;


• | Rockland Trust Phoenix LLC, formed for the purpose of holding, maintaining, and disposing of certain foreclosed properties;


• | Bright Rock Capital Management LLC, which was established to act as a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940; and


• | Compass Exchange Advisors LLC, which provides like-kind exchange services pursuant to section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.

Periodically, Compass Exchange Advisors LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, acts as an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (“EAT”) in connection with customers' like-kind exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. When Compass Exchange Advisors LLC provides EAT services, it establishes an EAT entity to hold title to property for its customers for up to 180 days in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidelines. EAT entities are considered the property owner solely for federal income tax purposes, and in no other instances, in order to facilitate a customer's like kind exchange. A typical EAT entity is a Massachusetts corporation whose directors are all Rockland Trust officers and which has Compass Exchange Advisors LLC as its sole shareholder. The EAT entity owns all of the membership interest in a LLC which holds title to the property and is managed by the customer. All financial benefits and burdens of property ownership are borne by the customer. EAT entities are therefore not consolidated onto Compass Exchange Advisors LLC's balance sheet in accordance with requirements of the consolidation topic of the ASC. 
Market Area and Competition
The Bank contends with considerable competition both in generating loans and attracting deposits. The Bank’s competition for generating loans is primarily from other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, online lenders or online banks, and other institutional lenders. Competitive factors considered for loan generation include interest rates, terms offered, loan fees charged, loan products offered, services provided, and geographic locations.
In attracting deposits, the Bank’s primary competitors are savings banks, commercial and co-operative banks, credit unions, internet banks, as well as other nonbank institutions that offer financial alternatives such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. Competitive factors considered in attracting and retaining deposits include deposit and investment products and their respective rates of return, brand awareness, liquidity, and risk, among other factors, such as convenient branch locations and hours of operation, personalized customer service, online and mobile access to accounts and automated teller machines.
The Bank’s market area is attractive and entry into the market by financial institutions previously not competing in the market area may continue to occur which could impact the Bank’s growth or profitability. The Bank’s market area is generally comprised of Eastern Massachusetts, including Greater Boston, the South Shore, Cape Cod and the Islands, as well as Worcester County and Rhode Island. 
Lending Activities
The Bank’s gross loan portfolio (loans before allowance for loan losses) amounted to $6.9 billion on December 31, 2018, or 78.0% of total assets. The Bank classifies loans as commercial, consumer real estate, or other consumer. Commercial loans consist of commercial and industrial loans, asset-based loans, commercial real estate, commercial construction, and small business loans. Commercial and industrial loans generally consist of loans to customers with credit needs in excess of $250,000 and revenue in excess of $2.5 million, and are made for working capital and other business-related purposes and floor plan financing. Asset-based loans consist primarily of revolving lines of credit but also include term loans. Asset-based revolving lines of credit are typically structured as committed lines with terms of three to five years, have variable rates of interest, and are collateralized by accounts receivable and inventory. Asset-based term loans are typically secured by owner occupied commercial real estate and machinery and equipment. Commercial real estate loans are comprised of commercial mortgages, including mortgages for construction purposes that are secured by nonresidential properties, multifamily properties, or one-to-four family rental properties. Small business loans, including real estate loans, generally consist of loans to businesses with commercial credit needs of less than or equal to $250,000 and revenues of less than $2.5 million. Consumer real estate consists of residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured primarily by owner-occupied residences and mortgages for the construction of residential properties. Other consumer loans are mainly personal loans. 
The Bank’s borrowers consist of small-to-medium sized businesses and consumers. Substantially all of the Bank’s commercial, consumer real estate, and other consumer loan portfolios consist of loans made to residents of and businesses located in the Bank’s market area. The majority of the real estate loans in the Bank’s loan portfolio are secured by properties located within this market area.
Interest rates charged on loans may be fixed or variable and vary with the degree of risk, loan term, underwriting and servicing costs, loan amount, and the extent of other banking relationships maintained with customers. Rates are further subject to competitive pressures, the current interest rate environment, availability of funds, and government regulations.
The Bank’s principal earning assets are its loans. Although the Bank judges its borrowers' creditworthiness, the risk of deterioration in borrowers’ abilities to repay their loans in accordance with their existing loan agreements is inherent in any lending function. Participating as a lender in the credit market requires a strict underwriting and monitoring process to minimize credit risk. This process requires substantial analysis of the loan application, an evaluation of the customer’s capacity to repay according to the loan’s contractual terms, and an objective determination of the value of the collateral. The Bank also utilizes the services of an independent third-party to provide loan review services, which consist of a variety of monitoring techniques performed after a loan becomes part of the Bank’s portfolio.
The Bank’s Controlled Asset and Consumer Collections departments are responsible for the management and resolution of nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans that are more than 90 days past due but still accruing interest. In the course of resolving nonperforming loans, the Bank may choose to foreclose on the loan or restructure the contractual terms of certain loans, by modifying the terms of the loan to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status. 
Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) includes real estate properties, which have primarily served as collateral to secure loans, that are controlled or owned by the Bank. 
Origination and Sale of Loans    Commercial and industrial, asset-based, commercial real estate, and construction loan applications are obtained through existing customers, solicitation by Bank personnel, referrals from current or past customers, or walk-in customers. Small business loan applications are typically originated by the Bank’s retail staff, through a dedicated team of business officers, by referrals from other areas of the Bank, by referrals from current or past customers, or through walk-in customers. Consumer loan applications primarily result from referrals by real estate brokers, branch referrals, homebuilders, advertising, direct mail, and existing or walk-in customers who have been made aware of the Bank’s consumer loan services through advertising, direct mail, and other media.
Loans are approved based upon a hierarchy of authority, predicated upon the size of the loan. Levels within the hierarchy of lending authorities range from individual lenders to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors. In accordance with governing banking statutes, the Bank is permitted, with certain exceptions, to make loans and commitments to any one borrower, including related entities, in the aggregate amount of not more than 20% of the Bank’s stockholders’ equity, or $225.2 million, at December 31, 2018, which is the Bank’s legal lending limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Bank has established a more restrictive limit of not more than 75% of the Bank’s legal lending limit, or $168.9 million, at December 31, 2018, which may only be exceeded with the approval of the Board of Directors. There were no borrowers whose total indebtedness in aggregate exceeded the Bank’s self-imposed restrictive limit. The Bank’s largest relationship as of December 31, 2018 consisted of 53 loans with an aggregate exposure of $88.6 million.
The Bank’s residential mortgage loans are originated in compliance with terms, conditions and documentation which permit the sale of such loans to investors in the secondary market. Loan sales in the secondary market provide funds for additional lending and other banking activities. Currently, the Bank sells the servicing of the sold loans for a servicing released premium, simultaneous with the sale of the loan. In the past, the Bank may have opted to sell loans and retain the servicing. In these instances, a mortgage servicing rights asset would have been recognized. As part of its asset/liability management strategy, the Bank may opt to retain certain adjustable rate and fixed rate residential real estate loan originations for its portfolio. During 2018, the Bank originated $372.6 million in residential real estate loans of which $182.4 million were retained in its portfolio. 
Participation Loans From time to time, the Bank may purchase or sell participating interests in commercial loans to reposition its loan portfolio with the objectives of diversifying credit risk, growing earning assets and/or increasing liquidity. The Bank’s approach to underwriting and approving participation loans, both purchased and sold, is consistent with its underwriting and approval policies and procedures for non-participated loans originated by the Bank. For participation loans purchased by the Bank, prior to deciding to purchase a participating interest in the loan, the Bank completes its own credit analysis that is independent of the lead or agent bank’s analysis of the offering. For loans originated by the Bank where it sells participating interests, the Bank will generally retain the lead servicing position for the loan. As of December 31, 2018, the unamortized balance of participation loans purchased was $491.7 million, while the sold portion of the unamortized balance of participation loans originated and sold totaled $137.6 million. 
Loan Portfolio    The following table shows the balance of the loans, the percentage of the gross loan portfolio, and the percentage of total interest income that the loans generated, by category, for the fiscal years indicated:

Commercial Loans    Commercial loans consist of commercial and industrial loans, asset-based loans, commercial real estate loans, commercial construction loans and small business loans. The Bank offers secured and unsecured commercial loans for business purposes. Commercial loans may be structured as term loans or as revolving/nonrevolving lines of credit, and include overdraft protection, credit cards, and automatic clearinghouse (“ACH”) exposure. These loans may be collateralized by either owner or nonowner-occupied commercial mortgages.
The following pie chart shows the diversification of the commercial and industrial portfolio as of December 31, 2018:

 | (Dollars in thousands)
Average loan size | $ | 275

Commercial and industrial term loans generally have a repayment schedule of five years or less and, although the Bank occasionally originates some commercial term loans with interest rates which float in accordance with a designated index rate, the majority of commercial term loans have fixed rates of interest and are collateralized by equipment, machinery or other corporate assets. In addition, the Bank generally obtains personal guarantees from the principal owners of the borrower for its commercial loans. At December 31, 2018, there were $371.6 million of term loans in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.
Collateral for commercial and industrial revolving lines of credit, including asset based lines, may consist of accounts receivable, inventory, or both, as well as other business assets. Commercial revolving lines of credit and asset based lines generally are reviewed on an annual basis and usually require either a borrowing base formula or substantial repayment of principal during the course of a year. The vast majority of these revolving lines of credit have variable rates of interest. At December 31, 2018, there were $722.0 million of revolving lines of credit in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio.
Also included in the commercial and industrial portfolio are automobile and, to a lesser extent, boat, recreational vehicle, and other vehicle floor plan financing. Floor plan loans are secured by the automobiles, boats, or other vehicles, which constitute the dealer’s inventory. Upon the sale of a floor plan unit, the proceeds of the sale are applied to reduce the loan balance. In the event a unit financed under a floor plan line of credit remains in the dealer’s inventory for an extended period, the Bank requires the dealer to pay-down the outstanding balance associated with such unit. Contractors hired by the Bank make unannounced periodic inspections of each dealer to review the condition of the underlying collateral and ensure that each unit that the Company has financed is accounted for. At December 31, 2018, there were $93.0 million in floor plan loans, all of which have variable rates of interest.
Small business lending caters to all of the banking needs of businesses with commercial credit requirements and revenues typically less than or equal to $250,000 and $2.5 million, respectively, and uses partially automated loan underwriting capabilities. Additionally, the Company makes use of the Bank’s authority as a preferred lender with the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). At December 31, 2018, there were $30.8 million of SBA guaranteed loans in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan categories, and $12.8 million of SBA guaranteed loans in the small business loan category.
The Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio, inclusive of commercial construction, is the Bank’s largest loan type concentration. The Bank believes this portfolio is well-diversified with loans secured by a variety of property types, such as owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied commercial, retail, office, industrial, warehouse, industrial development bonds, and other special purpose properties, such as hotels, motels, nursing homes, restaurants, churches, recreational facilities, marinas, and golf courses. Commercial real estate also includes loans secured by certain residential-related property types including multi-family apartment buildings, residential development tracts and condominiums.
The following pie chart shows the diversification of the commercial real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2018:

Select Statistics Regarding the Commercial Real Estate Portfolio 
 | (Dollars in thousands)
Average loan size | $ | 858

Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans typically are underwritten with maturities of five to ten years. These loans generally have amortization periods of 20 to 25 years, with interest rates that float in accordance with a designated index or that are fixed during the origination process. For loans with terms greater than five years, with certain exceptions, interest rates may be fixed for no longer than five years and are reset typically on the fifth anniversary of the loan. It is the Bank’s practice to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrower on commercial real estate loans and to obtain financial statements at least annually from all actively managed commercial and multi-family borrowers.
Commercial real estate lending entails additional risks as compared to residential real estate lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Development of commercial real estate projects also may be subject to numerous land use and environmental issues. The payment experience on such loans is typically dependent on the successful operation of the real estate project, which can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions within the markets for commercial, retail, office, industrial/warehouse and multi-family tenancy.
Also included in the commercial real estate portfolio are industrial developmental bonds. The Bank owns certain bonds issued by various state agencies, municipalities and nonprofit organizations that it categorizes as loans. This categorization is made on the basis that another entity (i.e. the Bank’s customer), not the issuing agency, is responsible for the payment to the Bank of the principal and interest on the debt. Furthermore, credit underwriting is based solely on the credit of the customer (and guarantors, if any), the banking relationship is with the customer and not the agency, there is no active secondary market for the bonds, and the bonds are not available for sale, but are intended to be held by the Bank until maturity. Therefore, the Bank believes that such bonds are more appropriately characterized as loans, rather than securities. At December 31, 2018, the balance of industrial development bonds was $77.0 million.
Construction loans are intended to finance the construction of residential and commercial properties, including loans for the acquisition and development of land or rehabilitation of existing properties. Nonpermanent construction loans generally have terms of at least six months, but not more than two years. They usually do not provide for amortization of the loan balance during 
9

the construction term. The majority of the Bank’s commercial construction loans have floating rates of interest. At December 31, 2018, the commercial construction portfolio amounted to $365.2 million.
Construction loans are generally considered to present a higher degree of risk than permanent real estate loans and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as adverse changes in interest rates and the borrower’s ability to control costs and adhere to time schedules. Other construction-related risks may include market risk, that is, the risk that “for-sale” or “for-lease” units may not be absorbed by the market within a developer’s anticipated time-frame or at a developer’s anticipated price. When the Company enters into a loan agreement with a borrower on a construction loan, an interest reserve may be included in the amount of the loan commitment to the borrower and it allows the lender to periodically advance loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the loan. The interest may be capitalized and added to the loan balance. Management actively tracks and monitors these accounts. 
Consumer Real Estate Loans    The Bank’s consumer real estate loans consist of loans and lines secured by one-to-four family residential properties.
The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential real estate loans. The Bank will lend up to 97% of the lesser of the appraised value of the residential property securing the loan or the purchase price, and generally requires borrowers to obtain private mortgage insurance when the amount of the loan exceeds 80% of the value of the property. In certain instances for loans that qualify for the Fannie Mae Home Affordable Refinance Initiative and other similar programs, the Bank will lend up to 125% of the appraised value of the residential property, and such loans are then subsequently sold by the Bank. The rates of these loans are typically competitive with market rates. The Bank’s residential real estate loans are generally originated only under terms, conditions and documentation which permit sale in the secondary market. In order to protect the properties securing its residential and other real estate loans, the Bank requires title insurance protecting the priority of its mortgage lien, as well as fire, extended casualty, and flood insurance, when necessary. Independent appraisers assess properties securing all of the Bank’s first mortgage real estate loans, as required by regulatory standards.
Home equity loans and lines may be made as fixed rate term loans or under variable rate revolving lines of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower’s residence or second home. At December 31, 2018, 59.9% of the home equity portfolio was in first lien position and 40.1% of the portfolio was in a subordinate position. At December 31, 2018, $415.6 million, or 38.1%, of the home equity portfolio was comprised of term loans and $676.5 million, or 61.9%, of the home equity portfolio was comprised of revolving lines of credit. The Bank will typically originate home equity loans and lines in an amount up to 80% of the appraised value or on-line valuation, reduced for any loans outstanding that are secured by such collateral. Home equity loans and lines are underwritten in accordance with the Bank’s loan policy, which includes a combination of credit history, loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio, employment history and debt-to-income ratio.
The Bank periodically supplements performance data with current Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) and LTV estimates. Current FICO data is purchased and typically appended to all consumer loans on a quarterly basis. In addition, automated valuation services and broker opinions of value are used to supplement original value data for the residential and home equity portfolios. Use of re-score and re-value data enables the Bank to better understand the current credit risk associated with these loans, but is not the only factor relied upon in determining a borrower’s creditworthiness. See Note 4, “Loans, Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality” within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for more information regarding FICO and LTV estimates.
Other Consumer Loans    Consumer loans primarily consist of investment management secured lines of credit, installment loans and overdraft protection. 
Investment Activities
The Bank’s securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. Government agency securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, agency collateralized mortgage obligations, and small business administration pooled securities. Also included in the Company's security portfolio are trading and equity securities related to certain employee benefit programs. The majority of these securities are investment grade debt obligations with average lives of five years or less. U.S. Government Agency securities entail a lesser degree of risk than loans made by the Bank by virtue of the guarantees that back them, require less capital under risk-based capital rules than noninsured or nonguaranteed mortgage loans, are more liquid than individual mortgage loans, and may be used to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of the Bank. The Bank views its securities portfolio as a source of income and liquidity. Interest and principal payments generated from securities provide a source of liquidity to fund loans and meet short-term cash needs. The Bank’s securities portfolio is managed in accordance with the Rockland Trust Company Investment Policy ("Investment Policy") approved by the Board of Directors. Two members of the Asset-Liability Committee of the Bank ("ALCO"), one of whom must be the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer, must approve purchases or sales, between meetings. These purchases are subject to limits on the type, size and quality of all investments, which are specified in the Investment Policy. The Bank’s ALCO, or its appointee, is required to evaluate any purchase from the standpoint of overall diversification of the portfolio. At December 31, 2018, the Company's securities totaled $1.1 billion, and generated interest and dividends of 8.2%, 8.1%, and 8.5% of total interest income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company reviews its security portfolio for impairment and to evaluate collection of principal and interest. If any securities are deferring interest payments, as they may be contractually entitled to do, the Company would place these securities on nonaccrual status and reverse any accrued but uncollected interest. 
Sources of Funds
Deposits    At December 31, 2018, total deposits were $7.4 billion. Deposits obtained through the Bank’s branch banking network have traditionally been the principal source of the Bank’s funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. The Bank has built a stable base of in-market core deposits from consumers, businesses, and municipalities. The Bank offers a range of demand deposits, interest checking, money market accounts, savings accounts, and time certificates of deposit. Interest rates on deposits are based on factors that include loan demand, deposit maturities, alternative costs of funds, and interest rates offered by competing financial institutions in the Bank’s market area. The Bank believes it has been able to attract and maintain satisfactory levels of deposits based on the level of service it provides to its customers, the convenience of its banking locations, its electronic banking options, and its interest rates, all of which are generally competitive with those of competing financial institutions. Additionally, the Bank has a municipal banking department that focuses on providing core depository services to local municipalities. Municipal deposits totaled $545.0 million as of December 31, 2018. 
The Company also participates in the Promontory Interfinancial Network, allowing the Bank to provide easy access to multi-million dollar Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") deposit insurance protection on certificate of deposit and money market investments for consumers, businesses and public entities. This channel allows the Company to seek additional funding in potentially large quantities by attracting deposits from outside the Bank’s core market and amounted to $180.5 million and $48.5 million, at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, including approximately $141.2 million of funds transfered from the Company's discontinued customer repurchase agreements. During the second quarter of 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act ("EGRRCPA") was promulgated and determined that reciprocal deposits, such as those acquired through the Promontory Interfinancial Network, were no longer to be treated as brokered deposits. Accordingly, these amounts are no longer included in the total brokered amounts reported by the Company.
 In addition, the Company may occasionally raise funds through the use of brokered deposits outside of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which amounted to $6.0 million at both December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
Rockland Trust’s eighty-nine branch locations are supplemented by the Bank’s internet and mobile banking services as well as automated teller machine (“ATM”) cards and debit cards which may be used to conduct various banking transactions at ATMs maintained at each of the Bank’s full-service offices and eleven additional remote ATM locations. The ATM cards and debit cards also allow customers access to a variety of national and international ATM networks. The Bank's mobile banking services give customers the ability to use a variety of mobile devices to check balances, track account activity, pay bills, search transactions, and set up alerts for text or e-mail messages for changes in their account. Customers can also transfer funds between Rockland Trust accounts, deposit checks into their account, and identify the nearest branch or ATM directly from their mobile device.
Borrowings    As of December 31, 2018, total borrowings were $258.7 million. Borrowings consist of short-term and long-term obligations and may consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and junior subordinated debentures.
Rockland is a member of the FHLB of Boston. The primary reason for FHLB membership is to gain access to a reliable source of wholesale funding, particularly term funding, as a tool to manage liquidity and interest rate risk. As a member of the 
FHLB of Boston, the Bank is required to purchase stock in the FHLB. Accordingly, the Company had invested $15.7 million in FHLB stock and had $147.8 million outstanding in FHLB borrowings with original maturities ranging from less than 3 months to 20 years at December 31, 2018. In addition, the Bank had $953.5 million of borrowing capacity remaining with the FHLB at December 31, 2018, inclusive of a $5.0 million line of credit. 
Also included in borrowings at December 31, 2018 were $76.2 million of junior subordinated debentures, which are inclusive of unamortized fair value marks associated with previous acquisitions and net of unamortized issuance costs. Total borrowings also includes $34.7 million of subordinated debt, net of unamortized issuance costs. These instruments provide long-term funding as well as regulatory capital benefits. 
The Company also has access to other forms of borrowing, such as securities repurchase agreements. In a security repurchase agreement transaction, the Bank will generally sell a security, agreeing to repurchase either the same or a substantially identical security on a specified later date, at a price greater than the original sales price. The difference between the sale price and purchase price is the cost of the proceeds, which is recorded as interest expense. Payments on such borrowings are interest only until the scheduled repurchase date. In a repurchase agreement, the Bank is subject to the risk that the purchaser may default at maturity and not return the securities underlying the agreements. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank either deals with established firms when entering into these transactions or with customers whose agreements stipulate that the securities underlying the agreement are not delivered to the customer and instead are held in segregated safekeeping accounts by the Bank’s safekeeping agents. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank discontinued its customer repurchase sweep product and had no repurchase agreements with investment brokerage firms. 
See Note 8, “Borrowings” within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for more information regarding borrowings. 
Investment Management
The Rockland Trust Investment Management Group provides investment management and trust services to individuals, institutions, small businesses, and charitable institutions throughout the Bank's geographical footprint.
Accounts maintained by the Rockland Trust Investment Management Group consist of managed and nonmanaged accounts. Managed accounts are those for which the Bank is responsible for administration and investment management and/or investment advice, while nonmanaged accounts are those for which the Bank acts solely as a custodian or directed trustee. The Bank receives fees dependent upon the level and type of service(s) provided. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Investment Management Group generated gross fee revenues of $23.4 million. Total assets under administration as of December 31, 2018 were $3.6 billion, of which $3.3 billion was related to managed accounts. Included in these amounts as of December 31, 2018 were assets under administration of $268.0 million, relating to the Company's registered investment advisor, Bright Rock Capital Management, LLC, which provides institutional quality investment management services to both institutional and high net worth clients. 
The administration of trust and fiduciary accounts is monitored by the Trust Committee of the Bank’s Board of Directors. The Trust Committee has delegated administrative responsibilities to three committees, one for investments, one for administration, and one for operations, all of which are comprised of Investment Management Group officers who meet no less than quarterly.
The Bank has an agreement with LPL Financial (“LPL”) and its affiliates and their insurance subsidiary, LPL Insurance Associates, Inc., to offer the sale of mutual fund shares, unit investment trust shares, general securities, fixed and variable annuities and life insurance. Registered representatives who are both employed by the Bank and licensed and contracted with LPL are onsite to offer these products to the Bank’s customer base. These same agents are also approved and appointed with various other Broker General Agents for the purposes of processing insurance solutions for clients. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the retail investments and insurance group generated gross fee revenues of $2.7 million.
Regulation
The following discussion sets forth certain material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information relevant to the Company. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Company’s business. The laws and regulations governing the Company and the Bank that are described in the following discussion generally have been promulgated to offer protection to depositors and not for the purpose of protecting stockholders.
General    The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and as such is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). Rockland Trust is subject to regulation and examination by the Commissioner of Banks of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the “Commissioner”) and the FDIC.
The Bank Holding Company Act    The BHCA prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of any class of voting shares of any bank, or increasing such ownership or control of any bank, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve. The BHCA also prohibits the Company from, with certain exceptions, acquiring 5% or more of any class of voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than banking or managing or controlling banks.
Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve is authorized to approve the ownership by the Company of shares in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The Federal Reserve has, by regulation, determined that some activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHCA. These activities include, but are not limited to, operating a mortgage company, finance company, credit card company, factoring company, trust company or savings association; performing data processing operations; providing some securities brokerage services; acting as an investment or financial adviser; acting as an insurance agent for types of credit-related insurance; engaging in insurance underwriting under limited circumstances; leasing personal property on a full-payout, nonoperating basis; providing tax planning and preparation services; operating a collection agency and a credit bureau; and providing consumer financial counseling and courier services. The Federal Reserve also has determined that other activities, including real estate brokerage and syndication, land development, property management and, except under limited circumstances, underwriting of life insurance not related to credit transactions, are not closely related to banking and are not a proper incident thereto.
Financial Services Modernization Legislation    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended (“GLB”), repealed provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act which restricted the affiliation of Federal Reserve member banks with firms “engaged principally” in specified securities activities, and which restricted officer, director, or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person “primarily engaged” in specified securities activities.
In addition, the GLB preempts any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations, primarily related to insurance. The general effect of the law has been to establish a comprehensive framework permitting affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers, by revising and expanding the BHCA framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through an entity known as a “financial holding company.” “Financial activities” is broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.
Because the GLB permits banks, securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate, the financial services industry has experienced further consolidation, which has increased the amount of competition that the Company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products, many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the Company.
Interstate Banking    The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997, as amended (the “Interstate Banking Act”), permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in states other than their home state without regard to state laws that previously restricted or prohibited such acquisitions except for any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company, after the proposed acquisition, controls no more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States and no more than 30 percent or such lesser or greater amount set by state law of such deposits in that state. The Interstate Banking Act also facilitates the operation by state-chartered banks of branch networks across state lines.
Pursuant to Massachusetts law, no approval to acquire a banking institution, acquire additional shares in a banking institution, acquire substantially all the assets of a banking institution, or merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, may be given if the bank being acquired has been in existence for a period less than three years or, as a result of an acquisition, merger or consolidation, the bank holding company would control in excess of 30% of the total deposits of all state and federally chartered banks in Massachusetts, unless waived by the Commissioner. With the prior written approval of the Commissioner, Massachusetts also permits the establishment of de novo branches in Massachusetts to the full extent permitted by the Interstate Banking Act, provided the laws of the home state of such out-of-state bank expressly authorize, under conditions no more restrictive than those of Massachusetts, Massachusetts’ banks to establish and operate de novo branches in such state.
Capital Requirements    The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHCA. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, referred to herein as the "Rules". The FDIC has adopted substantially identical rules (as interim final rules). 
Under the Rules, the minimum capital ratios for the Company and the Bank are as follows:
• 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") to risk-weighted assets.
• 6.0% Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets.
• 8.0% Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets.
• 4.0% Tier 1 leverage capital ratio.
Fully phased in as of January 1, 2019, the Rules also require the Company and the Bank to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” in an amount greater than 2.5%, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions that meet the minimum capital requirements of 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0% for CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital, respectively, but fall below the capital conservation buffer, will face constraints on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The capital conservation buffer effectively increases the minimum CET1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio to 8.5%, and the minimum total risk-based capital ratio to 10.5%, for banking organizations seeking to avoid the limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. As of January 1, 2019, the Company and the Bank maintained the required capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. 
The Rules provided for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income, and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. In addition, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, certain banking organizations could make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. The Company and the Bank each made such an election.
The deductions and other adjustments to CET1 were previously scheduled to be phased in incrementally between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018. In November 2017, banking regulations provided that the phase-in of certain of these adjustments for non-advanced approaches organizations such as the Bank was frozen.
With respect to the Bank, the Rules also revised the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the previous 6%); and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5% to be well-capitalized (as compared to the previously required leverage ratio of 3 or 4%). The Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any “prompt corrective action” category. When the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under the Rules will exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the "prompt corrective action" regulations.
The Rules prescribed a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. 
The revised minimum capital levels under the Rules are set forth below: 

 | Bank | | Holding Company 
 | Total Risk-Based Ratio | | Tier 1 Risk-Based Ratio | | Common Equity Tier 1 Capital | Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio | Total Risk-Based Ratio | | Tier 1 Risk-Based Ratio | | Common Equity Tier 1 Capital | Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio
Category | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Well capitalized | > 10% | and | > 8% | and | > 6.5% | > 5% | n/a | | n/a | | > 6.5% | n/a 
Adequately capitalized | > 8% | and | > 6% | and | > 4.5% | > 4% | > 8% | and | > 6% | and | > 4.5% | > 4% 
Undercapitalized | < 8% | or | < 6% | or | < 4.5% | < 4% | < 8% | or | < 6% | or | n/a | < 4% 
Significantly undercapitalized | < 6% | or | < 4% | or | < 3% | < 3% | n/a | | n/a | | n/a | n/a 

The Company is currently in compliance with the above-described regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20, “Regulatory Matters” within Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof for more information.
Commitments to Affiliated Institutions    Under Federal Reserve policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not be able to provide such support. Similarly, under the cross-guarantee provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, in the event of a loss suffered or anticipated by the FDIC - either as a result of default of a banking or thrift subsidiary of a bank holding company such as the Company or related to FDIC assistance provided to a subsidiary in danger of default - the other banking subsidiaries of such bank holding company may be assessed for the FDIC’s loss, subject to certain exceptions.
Limitations on Acquisitions of Common Stock    The federal Change in Bank Control Act, as amended (“CBCA”) prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company or bank unless the appropriate federal bank regulator has been given 60 days prior written notice of such proposed acquisition and, within that time period, such regulator has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition or extending for up to another 30 days the period during which such a disapproval may be issued. The acquisition of 25% or more of any class of voting securities constitutes the acquisition of control under the CBCA. In addition, under a rebuttal presumption established under the CBCA regulations, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company or a FDIC insured bank, with a class of securities registered under or subject to the requirements of Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute the acquisition of control.
Any company would be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA before acquiring 25% (5% in the case of an acquirer that is a bank holding company) or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company, or such lesser number of shares as constitute control over the Company. Such approval would be contingent upon, among other things, the acquirer registering as a bank holding company, divesting all impermissible holdings and ceasing any activities not permissible for a bank holding company. The Company does not own more than 5% voting stock in any banking institution other than the Bank.
FDIC Deposit Insurance    The Bank's deposit accounts are insured to the maximum extent permitted by law by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. The FDIC offers insurance coverage on deposits up to the federally insured limit of $250,000. 
The Bank is currently assessed a deposit insurance charge from the FDIC based upon the Bank's overall assessment base multiplied by an assessment rate, determined in part from five established risk categories. The Bank's assessment base is defined as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, adjusted for the impact of the risk category factors. During 2018, the Company expensed $2.8 million related to this assessment. 
Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)    Pursuant to the CRA and similar provisions of Massachusetts law, regulatory authorities review the performance of the Company and the Bank in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank. The applicable regulatory authorities consider compliance with this law in connection with applications for, among other things, approval of new branches, branch relocations, the engagement in certain additional financial activities under the GLBA, and acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies. The FDIC and the Massachusetts Division of Banks have assigned the Bank a CRA rating of 'Satisfactory' as of the latest examination.
Bank Secrecy Act    The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to monitor account activity, keep records and file reports that are determined to have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax and regulatory matters, and to implement anti-money laundering programs and compliance procedures.
USA Patriot Act of 2001    The Patriot Act strengthens U.S. law enforcement’s and the intelligence communities’ abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide-ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation    The U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. The Company and the Bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“SOX”), implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at public companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities laws. Among other things, SOX and/or its implementing regulations have established new membership requirements and additional responsibilities for the Company’s audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between the Company and its external auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services the external auditors may provide), imposed additional responsibilities for the external financial statements on the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for corporate insiders, required management to evaluate disclosure controls and procedures, as well as internal control over financial reporting, and required the auditors to issue a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Regulation W    Transactions between a bank and its “affiliates” are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act applies Sections 23A and 23B to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve has also issued Regulation W, which codifies prior regulations under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions. Regulation W incorporates the exemption from the affiliate transaction rules, but expands the exemption to cover the purchase of any type of loan or extension of credit from an affiliate. Affiliates of a bank include, among other entities, the bank’s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank. The Company is considered to be an affiliate of the Bank. In general, subject to certain specified exemptions, a bank and its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to engage in “covered transactions” with affiliates:

• | to an amount equal to 10% of the bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate; and


• | to an amount equal to 20% of the bank’s capital and surplus, in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates.

In addition, a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions and other specified transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. A “covered transaction” includes:

• | a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate;


• | a purchase of, or an investment in, securities issued by an affiliate;


• | a purchase of assets from an affiliate, with some exceptions;


• | the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any party; and


• | the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate.

In addition, under Regulation W:

• | a bank and its subsidiaries may not purchase a low-quality asset from an affiliate;


• | covered transactions and other specified transactions between a bank or its subsidiaries and an affiliate must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices; and


• | with some exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by a bank to an affiliate must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130%, depending on the type of collateral, of the amount of the loan or extension of credit.

Regulation W generally excludes all nonbank and nonsavings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates, except to the extent that the Federal Reserve decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates.
New Markets Tax Credit Program    The New Markets Tax Credit Program was created in December 2000 under federal law to provide federal tax incentives to induce private-sector, market-driven investment in businesses and real estate development projects located in low-income urban and rural communities across the nation. The New Markets Tax Credit Program is part of the United States Department of the Treasury Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The New Markets Tax Credit Program enables investors to acquire federal tax credits by making equity investments for a period of at least seven years in qualified community development entities, which have been awarded tax credit allocation authority by, and entered into an allocation agreement with, the United States Treasury. Community development entities must use equity investments to make loans to, or other investments in, qualified businesses and individuals in low-income communities in accordance with New Markets Tax Credit Program criteria. Investors receive an overall tax credit equal to 39% of their total equity investment, credited at a rate of 5% in each of the first 3 years and 6% in each of the final 4 years. More information on the New Markets Tax Credit Program 
may be obtained at www.cdfifund.gov. (The Company has included the web address only as inactive textual references and does not intend it to be an active link to the New Markets Tax Credit Program's website.) For further details about the Bank’s New Markets Tax Credit Program, see the paragraph entitled “Income Taxes” included in Item 7 below.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act    During 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). This significant law affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. 
Key provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are as follows:

• | eliminated the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts.


• | broadened the base for Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor. 


• | requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The Company provides its shareholders with the opportunity to vote on executive compensation every year. 


• | broadened the scope of derivative instruments, and the Company is subject to increased regulation of its derivative business, including record-keeping, reporting requirements, and heightened supervision.


• | created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. If and when the Bank exceeds $10 billion in assets, it will become subject to supervision by the CFPB. Until such time, the Bank, and other banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. The Bank anticipates that it will cross the $10 billion threshold upon the closing of the merger of Blue Hills Bank with and into the Bank and will thus become subject to regulation by the CFPB. 


• | debit card and interchange fees must be reasonable and proportional to the issuer’s cost for processing the transaction.

Under the Durbin Amendment contained in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules that apply to banks with more than $10 billion in assets, which established a maximum permissible interchange fee equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover 1 cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. If and when the Bank exceeds $10 billion in assets, it will become subject to the interchange fee cap. The Bank anticipates that it will cross the $10 billion threshold upon the closing of the merger of Blue Hills Bank with and into the Bank and will thus become subject to the interchange fee cap.
On May 24, 2018, the EGRRCPA was signed into law, making certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as certain targeted modifications to other post-financial crisis regulations. While the EGRRCPA eased some regulatory obligations imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, including the requirement to conduct stress testing if and when the Company exceeds the $10 billion asset threshold, it had minimal impact on the Company’s operations.
Incentive Compensation The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, with at least $1 billion in total assets such as the Company and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. 
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the 
organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act.
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
Volcker Rule On December 10, 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the CFTC and the SEC (collectively, the “Volcker Rule Agencies”) issued final rules to implement the Volcker Rule contained in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from: (i) engaging in “proprietary trading” and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain types of funds (defined as “Covered Funds”) subject to certain limited exceptions. The rule also effectively prohibits short-term trading strategies by any U.S. banking entity if those strategies involve instruments other than those specifically permitted for trading and prohibits the use of some hedging strategies. The Company has no investments that met the definition of Covered Funds under the foregoing rules. 
In addition, The EGRRCPA exempts from the Volcker Rule all banks with (i) total assets less than $10 billion, and (ii) trading assets and liabilities that comprise no more than 5% of total assets. The Bank anticipates that it will cross the $10 billion threshold upon the closing of the merger of Blue Hills Bank with and into the Bank and will thus become subject to the Volcker Rule. In mid-2018, the Volcker Rule Agencies proposed new rules modifying certain aspects of the Volcker Rule, including the establishment of a new tiered compliance regime (based on the size of a bank’s trading assets and liabilities) and changes to the proprietary trading rules and Covered Funds rules, among other things. These proposed new rules have not been adopted yet.
Consumer Protection Regulations The Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to the following:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C, requiring financial institutions to provide certain information about home mortgage and refinanced loans;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act and Regulation V, governing the provision of consumer information to credit reporting agencies and the use of consumer information; and


• | Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.

The Bank’s deposit operations are also subject to the following federal statutes and regulations, among others:

• | The Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD, which requires disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;


• | Regulation CC, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;


• | The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and


• | Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, governing automatic deposits to, and withdrawals from, deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

Many of the foregoing laws and regulations are subject to change resulting from provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, which in many cases calls for revisions to implementing regulations, such as the amendments described above in the discussion on the Dodd-Frank Act.
Regulation E    Federal Reserve Regulation E governs electronic fund transfers and provides a basic framework that establishes the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in electronic fund transfer systems such as automated teller machine transfers, telephone bill-payment services, point-of-sale terminal transfers in stores, and preauthorized transfers from or to a consumer’s account (such as direct deposit and social security payments). The term “electronic fund transfer” generally refers to a transaction initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape that instructs a financial institution 
either to credit or to debit a consumer’s asset account. Regulation E describes the disclosures that financial institutions are required to make to consumers who engage in electronic fund transfers and generally limits a consumer’s liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers, such as those arising from loss or theft of an access device, to $50 for consumers who notify their bank in a timely manner.
London Interbank Offered Rate    Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based on observable market transactions because of the probable phase-out of LIBOR. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. Although the full impact of a transition, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, this change may have an adverse impact on the value of, return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products, including any LIBOR-based securities, loans and derivatives that are included in the Company’s financial assets and liabilities. A transition away from LIBOR may also require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products, as well as the Company’s systems and processes.
