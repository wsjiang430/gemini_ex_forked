ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation was formed on November 20, 2013 under the Maryland General Corporation Law ("MGCL") and qualified as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") commencing with the year ended December 31, 2015. We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring single tenant net lease properties that are considered essential to the occupying tenant, and have used a substantial amount of the net proceeds from our initial public offering ("IPO") and our follow-on offering to invest in these properties. We operate as a daily net asset value ("NAV") REIT, posting a NAV for each of our share classes on every business day. We have no employees and are externally advised and managed by our advisor, Griffin Capital Essential Asset Advisor II, LLC (the "Advisor"), which is indirectly owned by our sponsor, Griffin Capital Real Estate Company, LLC ("GRECO" or our "Sponsor"). Prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (as defined below), on December 14, 2018, Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, Inc. ("GCEAR"), a non-traded REIT sponsored by our former sponsor, Griffin Capital Company, LLC ("GCC"), entered into a series of transactions and became self-managed (the “Self Administration Transaction”) and succeeded to the advisory, asset management and property management arrangements formerly in place for us. Accordingly, our Sponsor has changed from GCC to GRECO until the Company Merger (defined below) is consummated. Our year end is December 31.
On September 20, 2017, we commenced a follow-on offering of up to $2.2 billion of shares, consisting of up to $2.0 billion of shares (the "Follow-On Offering") in our primary offering and $0.2 billion of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). We reclassified all Class T and Class I shares sold in the IPO as "Class AA" and "Class AAA" shares, respectively, and offered to the public four new classes of shares of common stock: Class T shares, Class S shares, Class D shares and Class I shares (the "New Shares") with NAV based pricing in the primary portion of the Follow-On Offering. The DRP offering included all seven of our share classes. The share classes have different selling commissions, dealer manager fees and ongoing distribution fees. Our board of directors (the "Board"), including a majority of the independent directors, has adopted valuation procedures that contain a comprehensive set of methodologies to be used in connection with the calculation of the NAV. On August 16, 2018, our Board approved the temporary suspension of the primary portion of our Follow-On Offering, effective August 17, 2018. On December 12, 2018, we also temporarily suspended our DRP offering and our share redemption program ("SRP"). Beginning in January 2019, all distributions by us were paid in cash. The SRP was officially suspended as of January 19, 2019. On February 15, 2019, our Board determined it was in our best interests to reinstate the DRP effective with the February distribution to be paid on or around March 1, 2019. We intend to recommence our SRP once the Mergers (defined below) are completed. At this time, we intend to recommence our Follow-On Offering, if appropriate and at the appropriate time, once the Mergers are completed.
Our charter authorizes up to 1,000,000,000 shares of stock, of which 800,000,000 shares are designated as common stock at $0.001 par value per share and 200,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock at $0.001 par value per share. Our 800,000,000 shares of common stock are classified as follows: 150,000,000 shares are classified as Class T shares, 150,000,000 shares are classified as Class S shares, 150,000,000 shares are classified as Class D shares, 150,000,000 shares are classified as Class I shares, 70,000,000 shares are classified as Class A shares, 120,000,000 shares are classified as Class AA shares and 10,000,000 shares are classified as Class AAA shares. 
As of March 11, 2019, we had 77,691,323 shares of our common stock outstanding, including shares issued pursuant to our DRP, less shares redeemed pursuant to our SRP.
Pending Merger of Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, Inc. into our Company

On December 14, 2018, we, Griffin Capital Essential Asset Operating Partnership II, L.P. (our "Operating Partnership"), our wholly owned subsidiary Globe Merger Sub, LLC ("Merger Sub"), Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT, Inc. (“GCEAR”), and the Griffin Capital Essential Asset Operating Partnership, L.P. ( the "GCEAR Operating Partnership") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”).
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, (i) GCEAR will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as our direct, wholly owned subsidiary (the “Company Merger”) and (ii) our Operating Partnership will merge with and into the GCEAR Operating Partnership (the “Partnership Merger” and, together with the Company Merger, the “Mergers”), with the GCEAR Operating Partnership surviving the Partnership Merger. At such time, (x) in accordance with the applicable provisions of the MGCL, the separate existence of GCEAR shall cease and (y) in accordance with the Delaware 
5

Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, the separate existence of our Operating Partnership shall cease. We refer to our Company after the consummation of the Mergers as the "Combined Company."
At the effective time of the Company Merger, each issued and outstanding share of GCEAR’s common stock (or fraction thereof), $0.001 par value per share (the “GCEAR Common Stock”), will be converted into the right to receive 1.04807 shares of our newly created Class E common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Class E Common Stock”), and each issued and outstanding share of GCEAR’s Series A cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of our newly created Series A cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock.
At the effective time of the Partnership Merger, each GCEAR Operating Partnership unit (“OP Units”) outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Partnership Merger will convert into the right to receive 1.04807 Class E OP Units in the surviving partnership and each Operating Partnership unit outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Partnership Merger will convert into the right to receive one OP Unit of like class in the surviving partnership. The special limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership will be automatically redeemed, canceled and retired as described in the Merger Agreement.
GCEAR’s outstanding debt of approximately $1.4 billion is expected to be refinanced or assumed by us at closing under the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
The Combined Company will have a total capitalization of approximately $4.72 billion, and will own 101 properties in 25 states, consisting of approximately 27.2 million square feet. On a pro forma basis, the Combined Company portfolio will be 96.8% occupied, with a remaining weighted average lease term of 7.3 years. Approximately 65.3% of the Combined Company portfolio net rent on a pro forma basis, will come from properties leased to tenants and/or guarantors who have, or whose non-guarantor parent companies have, investment grade or what management believes are generally equivalent ratings. In addition, no tenant will represent more than 4.0% of the net rents of the Combined Company, on a pro forma basis, with the top ten tenants comprising a collective 27.8% of the net rents of the Combined Company.
The Merger Agreement provides certain termination rights for us and GCEAR. In connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain specified circumstances, GCEAR may be required to pay us a termination fee of $52.2 million and we may be required to pay GCEAR a termination fee of $52.2 million. 
Upon completion of the Company Merger, we estimate that our continuing stockholders will own approximately 31% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Combined Company on a fully diluted basis, and former GCEAR stockholders will own approximately 69% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Combined Company on a fully diluted basis.
The foregoing descriptions of the Merger Agreement and the Mergers are not complete and are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2018. There is no guarantee that the Mergers will be consummated. 

Investment Objectives
Overview
We invest in a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant business essential properties. Our investment objectives and policies may be amended or changed at any time by our Board. Although we have no plans at this time to change any of our investment objectives, our Board may change any and all such investment objectives, including our focus on single tenant business essential properties, if they believe such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders. We intend to notify our stockholders of any change to our investment policies by disclosing such changes in a public filing such as a prospectus supplement, or through a filing under the Exchange Act, as appropriate. In addition, we may invest in real estate properties other than single tenant business essential properties if our Board deems such investments to be in the best interests of our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that our policies or investment objectives will be attained or that the value of our common stock will not decrease.
Primary Investment and Portfolio Management Objectives
Our primary investment and portfolio management objectives are to:

• | invest in income-producing real property in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes;

6

•provide regular cash distributions to achieve an attractive distribution yield; 
•preserve and protect invested capital; 
•realize appreciation in NAV from proactive portfolio and asset management; and

• | provide an investment alternative for stockholders seeking to allocate a portion of their long-term investment portfolios to commercial real estate with lower volatility than public real estate companies.

We cannot assure our stockholders that we will attain these primary investment and portfolio management objectives.
Investment Strategy
We seek to acquire a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant business essential properties throughout the United States diversified by corporate credit, physical geography, product type and lease duration. Although we have no current intention to do so, we may also invest a portion of the net investment proceeds in single tenant business essential properties outside the United States. We acquire assets consistent with our single tenant acquisition philosophy by focusing primarily on properties:
•essential to the business operations of the tenant;
•located in primary, secondary and certain select tertiary metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs; 
•leased to tenants with stable and/or improving credit quality; and

• | subject to long-term leases with defined rental rate increases or with short-term leases with high-probability renewal and potential for increasing rent.

Our management team has been acquiring single tenant business essential properties for over a decade. Our management team’s positive acquisition and ownership experience with single tenant business essential properties of the type we intend to acquire stems from the following:
7


• | the credit quality of the lease payment is determinable and equivalent to the senior unsecured credit rating of the tenant;


• | the essential nature of the asset to the tenant's business provides greater default protection relative to the tenant's balance sheet debt;


• | the percentage recovery in the event of a tenant default is empirically greater than an unsecured lender; and


• | long-term leases provide a consistent and predictable income stream across market cycles while short-term leases offer income appreciation upon renewal and reset.

We seek to provide investors the following benefits:

• | a cohesive management team experienced in all aspects of real estate investment with a track record of acquiring primarily single tenant business essential assets;


• | stable cash flow backed by a portfolio of primarily single tenant business essential real estate assets;


• | minimal exposure to operating and maintenance expense increases as we attempt to structure or acquire leases where the tenant assumes responsibility for these costs;


• | contractual lease rate increases enabling potential distribution growth and a potential hedge against inflation;


• | insulation from short-term economic cycles resulting from the long-term nature of underlying asset leases;


• | enhanced stability resulting from diversified credit characteristics of corporate credits; and


• | portfolio stability promoted through geographic and product type investment diversification.

We cannot assure you that any of the properties we acquire will result in the benefits discussed above.
General Acquisition and Investment Policies
We seek to make investments that satisfy the primary investment objective of providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. However, because a significant factor in the valuation of income-producing real property is its potential for future appreciation, some properties we acquire may have the potential both for growth in value and for providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders.
Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific properties. However, each acquisition will be approved by our Board. In selecting a potential property for acquisition, we consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 
•tenant creditworthiness;
•whether a property is essential to the business operations of the tenant;

• | lease terms, including length of lease term, scope of landlord responsibilities, presence and frequency of contractual rental increases, renewal option provisions, exclusive and permitted use provisions, co-tenancy requirements and termination options;

•projected demand in the area;
•a property’s geographic location and type; 
•proposed purchase price, terms and conditions; 
8

•historical financial performance; 
•projected net cash flow yield and internal rates of return; 
•a property’s physical location, visibility, curb appeal and access;
•construction quality and condition;
•potential for capital appreciation;

• | demographics of the area, neighborhood growth patterns, economic conditions, and local market conditions;

•potential capital and tenant improvements and reserves required to maintain the property;
•prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; 
•the potential for the construction of new properties in the area;
•treatment under applicable federal, state and local tax and other laws and regulations;
•evaluation of title and obtaining of satisfactory title insurance; and
•evaluation of any reasonable ascertainable risks such as environmental contamination.
There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net offering proceeds that may be invested in any particular property type or single property. The number and mix of properties will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition. In determining whether to purchase a particular property, we may obtain an option on such property. The amount paid for an option, if any, is normally surrendered if the property is not purchased and may or may not be credited against the purchase price if the property is ultimately purchased.
Description of Leases
We primarily acquire single tenant properties with existing net leases. When spaces in a property become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we anticipate entering into "net" leases. "Net" leases means leases that typically require tenants to pay all or a majority of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance charges and building repairs related to the property, in addition to the lease payments. There are various forms of net leases, typically classified as triple-net or double-net. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Some of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term and/or that require the tenant to pay rent based upon a number of factors. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay common area maintenance, insurance, and taxes associated with a property in addition to the base rent and percentage rent, if any. Double-net leases typically require the tenant to pay two of those three expenses. In either instance, these leases will typically hold the landlord responsible for the roof and structure, or other major repairs and replacements with respect to the property, while the tenant is responsible for only those operating expenses specified in the lease.
Most of our acquisitions have lease terms of five to 15 years at the time of the property acquisition. We may acquire properties under which the lease term has partially expired. We also may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is located in a desirable location, is difficult to replace, or has other significant favorable real estate attributes. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. As a precautionary measure, we obtain, to the extent available, contingent liability and property insurance and flood insurance, as well as loss of rents insurance that covers one or more years of annual rent in the event of a rental loss. In addition, we maintain a pollution insurance policy for all of our properties to insure against the risk of environmental contaminants; however, the coverage and amounts of our environmental and flood insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our entire risk.
9

Tenants are required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to our Advisor on an annual basis. The insurance certificates are tracked and reviewed for compliance by our property manager.
Our Borrowing Strategy and Policies
We may incur our indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly-or privately-placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. We may obtain a credit facility or separate loans for each acquisition. Our indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our properties, and by guarantees or pledges of membership interests. We may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties, to pay for capital improvements, repairs or buildouts, to refinance existing indebtedness, to pay distributions, to fund redemptions of our shares or to provide working capital. To the extent we borrow on a short-term basis, we may refinance such short-term debt into long-term, amortizing mortgages once a critical mass of properties has been acquired and to the extent such debt is available at terms that are favorable to the then in-place debt.
There is no limitation on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any property. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our Board at least quarterly. We anticipate that we will utilize approximately 50% leverage in connection with our acquisition strategy. However, our current charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets (equivalent to 75% of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with the justification for such excess. 
We may borrow amounts from our Sponsor and its affiliates only if such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties under the circumstances.
Except as set forth in our charter regarding debt limits, we may re-evaluate and change our debt strategy and policies in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we could consider when re-evaluating or changing our debt strategy and policies include then-current economic and market conditions, the relative cost of debt and equity capital, any acquisition opportunities, the ability of our properties to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to equity in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. As of December 31, 2018, our leverage ratio (defined in our credit agreement as debt to total acquisition price) was approximately 43.7%.
Acquisition Structure
Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in joint ventures or similar entities that own and operate real estate. We may also acquire ground leases.
We will make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly through our Operating Partnership or indirectly through limited liability companies or limited partnerships, or through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with other owners of properties, affiliates of our Advisor or other persons. 
Competition
As we purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the same properties, and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we intend to acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties.
10

Conditions to Closing Acquisitions
We obtain at least a Phase I environmental assessment and history for each property we acquire. In addition, we generally condition our obligation to close the purchase of any investment on the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or other independent professionals, including, but not limited to, where appropriate:
•property surveys and site audits;
•building plans and specifications, if available;
•soil reports, seismic studies, flood zone studies, if available;
•licenses, permits, maps and governmental approvals;
•tenant estoppel certificates;
•tenant financial statements and information, as permitted;
•historical financial statements and tax statement summaries of the properties;
•proof of marketable title, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to us; and
•liability and title insurance policies.
Joint Venture Investments
We may acquire some of our properties in joint ventures, some of which may be entered into with affiliates of our Advisor. We may also enter into joint ventures, general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose of owning and leasing real properties. Among other reasons, we may want to acquire properties through a joint venture with third parties or affiliates in order to diversify our portfolio of properties in terms of geographic region or property type. Joint ventures may also allow us to acquire an interest in a property without requiring that we fund the entire purchase price. In addition, certain properties may be available to us only through joint ventures. In determining whether to recommend a particular joint venture, our Advisor will evaluate the real property which such joint venture owns or is being formed to own under the same criteria that the Advisor uses to evaluate other real estate investments.
We may enter into joint ventures with affiliates of our Sponsor for the acquisition of properties, but only provided that:

• | a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and


• | the investment by us and such affiliate are on substantially the same terms and conditions otherwise dictated by the market.

To the extent possible and if approved by our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, we will attempt to obtain a right of first refusal or option to buy the property held by the joint venture and allow such venture partners to exchange their interest for our operating partnership’s units or to sell their interest to us in its entirety. In the event that the venture partner were to elect to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the venture partner’s interest in the property held by the joint venture. Entering into joint ventures with affiliates of our Sponsor may result in certain conflicts of interest. 
Construction and Development Activities
From time to time, we may construct and develop real estate assets or render services in connection with these activities. We may be able to reduce overall purchase costs by constructing and developing a property versus purchasing a completed property. Developing and constructing properties would, however, expose us to risks such as cost overruns, carrying costs of projects under construction or development, completion guarantees, availability and costs of materials and labor, weather conditions and government regulation. To comply with the applicable requirements under federal income tax law, we intend to limit our construction and development activities to performing oversight and review functions, including reviewing the construction design proposals, negotiating and contracting for feasibility studies and supervising compliance with local, state or 
11

federal laws and regulations, negotiating contracts, overseeing construction, and obtaining financing. In addition, we may use taxable REIT subsidiaries or certain independent contractors to carry out these oversight and review functions. We will retain independent contractors to perform the actual construction work.
Government Regulations
Our business is subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and courts, occur frequently. 
We and any operating subsidiaries that we may form may be subject to state and local tax in states and localities in which they or we do business or own property. The tax treatment of us, our Operating Partnership, any operating subsidiaries we may form and the holders of our shares in local jurisdictions may differ from our federal income tax treatment.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Complying with the ADA requirements could require us to remove access barriers. Failing to comply could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we acquire properties that substantially comply with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, a number of additional federal, state and local laws may require us to modify any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access by disabled persons. Additional legislation could impose financial obligations or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. Although we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on us, if required changes involve a greater amount of expenditures than we currently anticipate, our ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected. 
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances. These laws often impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigating, removing or remediating these substances may be substantial, and the presence of these substances may adversely affect our ability to rent properties or sell the property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may expose us to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to these substances. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location, we may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by us. We may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site that we own or operate. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. We maintain a pollution insurance policy for all of our properties to insure against the potential liability of remediation and exposure risk. 
Other Regulations
The properties we acquire likely will be subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as zoning and state and local fire and life safety requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. We acquire properties that are in material compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, we cannot assure you that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Disposition Policies
We generally intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period. However, we may sell a property at any time if, in our judgment, the sale of the property is in the best interests of our stockholders. 
The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will generally be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, other investment opportunities and considerations 
12

specific to the condition, value and financial performance of the property. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale.
We may sell assets to third parties or to affiliates of our Sponsor. Our nominating and corporate governance committee of our Board, which is comprised solely of independent directors, must review and approve all transactions between us and our Sponsor and its affiliates. 
Investment Limitations in Our Charter
Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds, most of which are those typically required by various provisions of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts published by the North American Securities Administrators Association ("NASAA REIT Guidelines"). 
Changes in Investment Policies and Limitations
Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interests of our stockholders. Each determination and the basis therefor is required to be set forth in the applicable meeting minutes. The methods of implementing our investment policies may also vary as new investment techniques are developed. The methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except as otherwise provided in our charter, may be altered by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. The determination by our Board that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to be qualified as a REIT shall require the concurrence of two-thirds of the Board. Investment policies and limitations specifically set forth in our charter, however, may only be amended by a vote of the stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares.
Investments in Mortgages
While we intend to emphasize equity real estate investments and, hence, operate as what is generally referred to as an "equity REIT," as opposed to a "mortgage REIT," we may invest in first or second mortgage loans, mezzanine loans secured by an interest in the entity owning the real estate or other similar real estate loans consistent with our REIT status. We may make such loans to developers in connection with construction and redevelopment of real estate properties. Such mortgages may or may not be insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration or another third party. We may also invest in participating or convertible mortgages if our directors conclude that we and our stockholders may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the subject property. Such mortgages are similar to equity participation.
Affiliate Transaction Policy
Our Board has established a nominating and corporate governance committee, which reviews and approves all matters the Board believes may involve a conflict of interest. This committee is composed solely of independent directors. This committee of our Board approves all transactions between us and our Sponsor and its affiliates. We will not acquire any properties in which GCC, our former Sponsor, or its affiliates, owns an economic interest.
Investment Company Act and Certain Other Policies
We intend to operate in such a manner that we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). We will continually review our investment activity to attempt to ensure that we do not come within the application of the 1940 Act. Among other things, our Advisor will attempt to monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments so that we do not come within the definition of an "investment company" under the 1940 Act. If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, we will take all necessary actions to attempt to ensure that we are not deemed to be an "investment company." In addition, we do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments.
Subject to the restrictions we must follow in order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may make investments other than as previously described in this report, although we do not currently intend to do so. We have authority to purchase or otherwise reacquire our shares of common stock or any of our other securities. We have no present intention of repurchasing any of our shares of common stock except (1) pursuant to our SRP and (2) if the Mergers are consummated, pursuant to a tender offer as provided for in the Merger Agreement, and we would only take such action in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the requirements for qualifying as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
13

Exchange Listing and Other Strategic Transactions
While we are currently operating as a perpetual-life REIT with an ongoing offering and SRP (both of which are temporarily suspended during the pending Mergers), we may consider a liquidity event at any time in the future (such as a merger, listing, or sale of assets) (a "Strategic Transaction"). We are not prohibited by our charter or otherwise from engaging in such a Strategic Transaction at any time. We believe this perpetual-life REIT structure allows us to weather real estate cycles and provides for maximum flexibility to execute an exit strategy when it is in the best interests of our stockholders. Subject to certain significant transactions that require stockholder approval, such as dissolution, merger into another entity in which we are not the surviving entity, consolidation or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, our Board maintains sole discretion to change our current strategy as circumstances change if it believes such a change is in the best interest of our stockholders. If our Board determines that a Strategic Transaction is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, we expect that the Board will take all relevant factors at that time into consideration when making a Strategic Transaction decision, including prevailing market conditions. 
Employees
We currently have no employees. The employees of our Sponsor and its affiliates currently provide and have provided in the past, management, acquisition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. Upon completion of the Mergers, all of our Sponsor’s acquisitions, asset management, investor relations, legal, compliance, financial reporting, and accounting personnel currently providing services to us will become our employees. 
Industry Segments
We internally evaluate all of our properties and interests therein as one reportable segment.
