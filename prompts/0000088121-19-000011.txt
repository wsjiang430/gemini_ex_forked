 Description of Business
 Principal Products and Services
 Pork Division – Seaboard, through its subsidiary Seaboard Foods LLC, engages in the business of hog production and pork processing in the U.S. Seaboard’s Pork division is a vertically integrated pork producer that primarily produces and sells fresh and frozen pork products to further processors, foodservice operators, grocery stores, distributors and retail outlets. This division’s sales are primarily to U.S. customers with some export sales to Japan, Mexico, China and numerous other foreign markets. Pork products include fresh pork, such as loins, tenderloins and ribs which are primarily sold to distributors and grocery stores and fresh and frozen pork products sold in bulk to further processors who produce products, such as lunchmeat, ham, bacon and sausage. 
 The Pork division’s pork processing plant, located in Guymon, Oklahoma, generally operates at a daily double-shift processing capacity of approximately six million hogs annually. Seaboard also has a ham boning and processing plant in Mexico. In 2018, Seaboard raised approximately 89% of the hogs processed at its processing plant, with the remaining hog requirements purchased primarily under contracts from independent producers. Seaboard’s hog production facilities consist of genetic and commercial breeding, farrowing, nursery and finishing buildings located in the Central U.S. These facilities have a capacity to produce over six million hogs annually. Seaboard owns and operates seven centrally located feed mills to provide formulated feed to these hogs. 
 The Pork division produces biodiesel at facilities in Oklahoma and Missouri which is sold to third parties. Biodiesel is produced from pork fat supplied by the division’s Oklahoma pork processing plant and from other animal fat and vegetable oil purchased from third parties. The biodiesel is sold to fuel blenders for distribution.
 Seaboard has a 50% noncontrolling interest in Seaboard Triumph Foods, LLC (“STF”), which operates a pork processing plant located in Iowa. STF began single-shift operations in September 2017 and a second shift commenced in October 2018. STF’s plant is designed to process about six million market hogs annually when operating at full capacity, which is expected to occur by the end of 2019. Seaboard has agreements with STF and Triumph Foods, LLC (“Triumph”), an independent pork processor, to market substantially all pork products produced at STF’s and Triumph’s pork processing plants. Seaboard and Triumph also sell a portion of the hogs they raise to the STF plant to be processed. Seaboard’s sales prices for its pork products are primarily based on a margin sharing arrangement that considers the average sales price and mix of products sold from the Seaboard, Triumph and STF pork processing plants.

Status of Product or Segment
 On January 5, 2018, the CT&M division completed the acquisition of Groupe Mimran (“Mimran”), which operates three flour mills located in Senegal and Ivory Coast that have a combined capacity of approximately 2,750 metric tons a day, and a trading business located in Monaco. The purchase price was $324 million, plus an earn-out between zero and $48 million, using the exchange rate in effect at closing.
 Also during the first quarter of 2018, Seaboard’s CT&M division acquired a 50% noncontrolling interest in a grain trading and flour milling business in Mauritania for total consideration of $16 million. The investment is accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported on a three-month lag. 
 In November 2018, Seaboard’s Power division entered into a contract to build a new floating power barge with capacity to generate approximately 146 megawatts of electricity using gaseous fuels, including natural gas. Operations are anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2021. The total cost of the project is estimated to exceed $160 million. 
 Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 None of Seaboard’s businesses utilize material amounts of raw materials that are dependent on purchases from one supplier or a small group of dominant suppliers except the following: the Power division has one primary supplier of natural gas, but the barge can run on other types of fuel; and the Turkey segment purchases a significant portion of its feed and grain used in the manufacturing of feed for its turkeys in North Carolina from Seaboard’s 50% partner in Butterball.

 Seaboard does not have sales to any one customer equal to 10% or more of consolidated revenues. The CT&M division derived 11% and 12% of its sales from a non-consolidated affiliate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

The Power division sells power in the Dominican Republic on the spot market accessed primarily by three wholly government-owned distribution companies. The Turkey segment had one customer that represented 15% and 13% of its sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and another customer that represented 11% of its sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other division has sales to a few customers that, if lost, would have a material adverse effect on any such division or on Seaboard taken as a whole.

Competitive Conditions
 Competition in Seaboard’s Pork division comes from a variety of regional, national and international producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. According to the trade publications Successful Farming and Informa Economics, Seaboard was ranked number three in hog production (based on sows in production) and number four in pork processing in the U.S. in 2018 (based on daily processing capacity, including Triumph’s and STF’s capacity).
 Seaboard’s commodity trading business faces competition from numerous traders around the world. Most of the grain processing and related businesses face competition from either imported products or other local producers in the same industries.

 Competition for the Turkey segment comes from a variety of national and regional producers and processors and is based primarily on product quality, customer service and price. Butterball ranks as one of the nation’s top three turkey producers based on live production.
