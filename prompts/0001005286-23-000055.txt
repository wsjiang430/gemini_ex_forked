Corporate Overview
Landec Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Landec,” the “Company”, "we" or "us") design, develop, manufacture, and sell differentiated products for biomaterials and food markets, and license technology applications to partners.
On August 10, 2022, Landec formally announced that we will become a CDMO-focused life sciences company with a planned corporate rebranding including renaming the Company to Lifecore Biomedical and exploring potential sales opportunities of the Company’s remaining Curation Foods assets.
Landec’s biomedical company, Lifecore Biomedical, Inc. (“Lifecore”), is a fully integrated contract development and manufacturing organization (“CDMO”) that offers highly differentiated capabilities in the development, fill and finish of sterile, injectable pharmaceutical products in syringes and vials. As a leading manufacturer of premium, injectable grade Hyaluronic Acid, Lifecore brings 37 years of expertise as a partner for global and emerging biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across multiple therapeutic categories to bring their innovations to market.
Landec’s natural food company, Curation Foods, Inc. (“Curation Foods”) is focused on innovating and distributing plant-based foods with 100% clean ingredients to retail, club and foodservice channels throughout North America.
Landec was incorporated in California on October 31, 1986 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 6, 2008. Landec’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “LFCR”. The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 3515 Lyman Boulevard, Chaska, Minnesota 55318, and the telephone number is (952) 368-4300.
Reportable Segments
Landec has three reportable business segments – Lifecore, Curation Foods, and Other, which are described below.
Lifecore Biomedical
Lifecore, located in Chaska, Minnesota, is a fully integrated CDMO that offers highly differentiated capabilities in the development, fill and finish of sterile, injectable pharmaceutical products in syringes and vials. It is involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical-grade sodium hyaluronate (“HA”) in bulk form as well as formulated and filled syringes and vials for injectable products used in treating a broad spectrum of medical conditions and procedures. Lifecore uses its fermentation process and aseptic formulation and filling expertise to be a leader in the development of HA-based products for multiple applications and to take advantage of non-HA device and drug opportunities which leverage its expertise in manufacturing and aseptic syringe filling capabilities.
Lifecore CDMO provides product development services to its partners for HA-based, as well as non-HA based, aseptically formulated and filled products. These services include activities such as technology development, material component changes, analytical method development, formulation development, pilot studies, stability studies, process validation and production of materials for clinical studies.
Built over many years of experience, Lifecore separates itself from its competition based on its five areas of expertise, including but not limited to Lifecore’s ability to:
Establish strategic relationships with market leaders: 
Lifecore continues to develop applications for products with partners who have strong marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities to end-user markets. Through its strong reputation and history of providing pharmaceutical grade HA and products, Lifecore has established long-term relationships with global and emerging biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies across multiple therapeutic categories, and leverages those partnerships to attract new relationships in other medical markets.
Expand medical applications for HA: 
Due to the growing knowledge of the unique characteristics of HA and Lifecore’s unique strength and history as a trusted manufacturer of pharmaceutical injectable grade HA products, Lifecore continues to identify and pursue opportunities for the use of HA in other medical applications, such as wound care, aesthetic surgery, drug delivery, next generation orthopedics and device coatings, and through sales to academic and corporate research customers. Further applications may involve expanding process development activity and/or additional licensing of technology.
Utilize manufacturing infrastructure to meet customer demand: 
Lifecore has made strategic capital investments in its CDMO business focusing on extending its aseptic filling capacity and capabilities to meet increasing partner demand and to attract new contract filling opportunities outside of HA markets. Lifecore is using its manufacturing capabilities to provide contract manufacturing and development services to its partners in the area of sterile pre-filled syringes and vials, as well as fermentation and purification requirements.
Maintain flexibility in product development and supply relationships:
Lifecore’s vertically integrated development and manufacturing capabilities allow it to establish a variety of contractual relationships with global corporate partners. Lifecore’s role in these relationships extends from supplying HA raw materials to providing technology transfer and development services to manufacturing aseptically filled, finished sterile products, and assuming full supply chain responsibilities.
Deliver consistent quality:
Lifecore has built a world class quality and regulatory system that is demonstrated in its results, processes and customer relationships. With over 35 years of a superior track record with global regulatory bodies (FDA, EMA, ANVISA, etc.), Lifecore is the partner of choice for companies looking for proven experience in delivering QbD, cGMP compliance, and manufacturing excellence with pharmaceutical elegance and quality. Lifecore’s world class quality and regulatory system and excellent track record with the global regulatory bodies ensure partners that they will safely bring innovative therapies to market.
Curation Foods
Curation Foods Overview
Based in Santa Maria, California, Curation Foods’ primary business is the processing, marketing and selling of guacamole, avocado products, and olive oils and wine vinegars. Curation Foods serves as the corporate umbrella for its portfolio of three natural food brands, O Olive Oil & Vinegar® products, and Yucatan® and Cabo Fresh® authentic guacamole and avocado products. We believe that the major distinguishing characteristics of Curation Foods that provide competitive advantage are insight driven product innovation, diversified fresh food supply chain, refrigerated supply chain and customer reach. We believe that Curation Foods is well positioned as a single source of a broad range of its products.
On December 13, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), Landec and Curation Foods (together, the “Sellers”), and Taylor Farms Retail, Inc. (“Taylor Farms” and together with the Sellers, the “Parties”) completed the sale (the “Eat Smart Disposition”) of Curation Foods’ Eat Smart business, including its salad and cut vegetable businesses (the “Business”), pursuant to the terms of an asset purchase agreement executed by the Parties on December 13, 2021 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Taylor Farms acquired the Business for a purchase price of $73.5 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments based upon net working capital at the Closing Date. As part of the Eat Smart Disposition, Taylor Farms acquired, among other assets related to the Business, the manufacturing facility and warehouses (and corresponding equipment) located in Bowling Green, Ohio and Guadalupe, California, as well as inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, intellectual property and information related to the Business, and assumed certain liabilities and executory obligations under the Company’s and Curation Foods’ outstanding contracts related to the Business, in each case, subject to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Following the Eat Smart Disposition, as well as the BreatheWay and Yucatan sales subsequent to fiscal year end, Curation Foods retains its O Olive business, and the Company retains its Lifecore business.
As a result of the Eat Smart Disposition, the Company met the requirements of ASC 205-20, to report the results of the Eat Smart business as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the operating results for the Eat Smart business have been reclassified as a discontinued operation within these consolidated financial statements.
Curation Foods Brands
O Olive Oil & Vinegar ("O"): The Company acquired O on March 1, 2017. O, founded in 1995, is based in Petaluma, California, and is the premier producer of California specialty olive oils and wine vinegars. Its products are sold in natural food, conventional grocery and mass retail stores, primarily in the United States and Canada.
Yucatan & Cabo Fresh Avocado Products: The Company acquired Yucatan Foods on December 1, 2018. Yucatan Foods was founded in 1991. As part of the acquisition of Yucatan Foods, Curation Foods acquired the newly built production facility in Guanajuato, Mexico. The Yucatan Foods business added a double-digit growth platform, a lower-cost infrastructure in Mexico, and higher margin product offerings that generally exhibit less sourcing volatility. The Company manufactures and sells Yucatan and Cabo Fresh guacamole and avocado food products primarily to the U.S. grocery channel, but also to the U.S. mass retail, Canadian grocery retail and foodservice channels. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, on February 7, 2023, the Company sold its Yucatan Foods business for $17.5 million in cash.

Windset: Until June 1, 2021, the Company held a 26.9% investment ownership in Windset Holding 2010 Ltd. (“Windset”), a leading edge grower of hydroponically-grown produce. Included in discontinued operations are the dividends and Landec’s share of the change in fair market value of its investment in Windset.
On June 1, 2021, the Company and Curation Foods sold all of its equity interests of Windset in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $45.1 million, subject to certain adjustments.
Other
Included in the Other segment is Corporate, which includes corporate general and administrative expenses, non-Lifecore and non-Curation Food interest income, interest expense, and income tax expenses.
COVID-19 Pandemic
There are many uncertainties regarding the current novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, including the scope of scientific and health issues, the anticipated duration of the pandemic, and the extent of local and worldwide social, political, and economic disruption it may cause. The COVID-19 pandemic, as well as actions taken in response to the pandemic, have had and we believe will continue to have significant adverse impacts on many aspects of the Company’s operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to sales, customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, the Company’s employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day. The Company expects to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and intends to continue to make adjustments to its responses accordingly.
Sales and Marketing
Lifecore relies on name recognition and referrals regarding its biomedical-based CDMO and manufacturing experience and expertise to attract new customers and offers its services with minimal marketing and sales infrastructure.
Curation Foods is supported by dedicated sales and marketing teams located throughout the U.S. and Canada.
Manufacturing and Processing
Seasonality
Lifecore is not significantly affected by seasonality. Curation Foods can be affected by seasonal weather factors, which can result in higher costs of sourcing and processing its products.
Lifecore Biomedical
The commercial production of HA requires fermentation, separation, and purification and aseptic processing capabilities. HA can primarily be produced in two ways, either through bacterial fermentation or through extraction from rooster combs. Lifecore produces HA only from bacterial fermentation, using an efficient microbial fermentation process and an effective purification operation.
Lifecore’s facilities in Chaska, Minnesota are used for the HA and non-HA manufacturing process, formulation, aseptic syringe and vial filling, analytical services, secondary packaging, warehousing raw materials and finished goods, and distribution. Lifecore provides versatility in the manufacturing of various types of finished products and supplies several different forms of HA and non-HA products in a variety of molecular weight fractions as powders, solutions and gels, and in a variety of bulk and single-use finished packages. As of the date of the Original 10-K, the Company believes that its current manufacturing capacity plan will be sufficient to allow it to meet the needs of its current customers for the foreseeable future.
Curation Foods
O Olive Oil & Vinegar
O uses third parties to crush, process, and bottle its olive oil products, primarily within California. The fermentation, production, and processing of vinegar is performed at the Company’s facility in Petaluma, California, using ingredients sourced from various third parties primarily within California. O uses third parties in California to bottle its vinegar products.
Yucatan and Cabo Fresh
Guacamole for the Yucatan and Cabo Fresh brands is primarily produced and packed at the Company’s facility in Guanajuato, Mexico, using ingredients sourced from various third parties within the United States and Mexico. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, on February 7, 2023, the Company sold its Yucatan Foods business for $17.5 million in cash.
BreatheWay
BreatheWay packaging systems use polymer manufacturing, membrane manufacturing, and label package conversion. Contract manufacturers make virtually all of the polymers for the BreatheWay packaging system and breathable membranes. Subsequent to the fiscal year ended May 29, 2022, on June 2, 2022, the Company sold its BreatheWay technology business for $3.2 million in cash.
Competition
The Company operates in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Competition from large food-products, industrial, medical and pharmaceutical companies is expected to be intense. In addition, the nature of our collaborative arrangements may result in our business partners and licensees becoming our competitors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do, and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products.
The food industry is highly competitive, and further consolidation with our customers would likely increase competition. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. We sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods. Our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.
In addition, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits.
Government Regulation 
Lifecore 
The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates and/or approves the clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, import, export, sale and promotion of medical devices and drug products in or from the United States. Some of the Company’s and its customers’ products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, which regulates some of the products as medical devices or drug products, that in some cases require FDA approval or clearance, prior to U.S. distribution of Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”), or New Drug Applications (“NDA”), or Pre-Market Notifications, or other submissions and by foreign countries, which regulate some of the products as medical devices or drug products.
Other regulatory requirements are placed on the design, manufacture, processing, packaging, labeling, distribution, record-keeping and reporting of a medical device or drug products and on the quality control procedures. For example, medical device and drug manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to assure compliance with device and/or drug requirements, as applicable. The FDA also conducts pre-approval inspections for PMA and NDA product introduction. Lifecore’s facility is subject to inspections as both a device and a drug manufacturing operation. For PMA devices and NDA drug products, the company that owns the product submission is required to submit an annual report and also to obtain approval, as applicable, for modifications to the device, drug product, or its labeling. Similarly, companies that own FDA Pre-Market Notifications for marketed products must obtain additional FDA clearance for certain modifications to their devices or labeling. Other applicable FDA requirements include but are not limited to reporting requirements such as the medical device reporting regulation, which requires certain companies to provide information to the FDA regarding deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. FDA also maintains adverse event reporting requirements for drug products, among other post-market regulatory requirements.
Curation Foods
The Company’s food products and operations are also subject to regulation by various foreign, federal, state, and local agencies, with respect to production processes, product attributes, packaging, labeling, advertising, import, export, storage, transportation and distribution.
In the U.S., food products are primarily regulated by the FDA, which has the authority to inspect the Company’s food facilities, and regulates, among other things, food manufacturing, food packing and holding, food additives, food safety, the growing and harvesting of produce intended for human consumption, food transportation, food labeling, food packaging, and food supplier controls including foreign supplier verification. In addition, advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations, such as those issued under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”). All of our U.S. facilities and food products must be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDC Act”) as amended by, among other things, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, our operations in Mexico are subject to Mexican regulations through the SAGARPA, and our food products sold into Canada must be in compliance with applicable Canadian food safety and labeling regulations.
