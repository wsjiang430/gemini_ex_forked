Industry Background
Today’s Communications Service Providers ("CSPs") and enterprises are investing in their networks to compete in an ever-changing technology and customer experience landscape driven largely by cloud computing, mobile workforces requiring hyper-connectivity, new high-performance applications and use cases, and an insatiable demand for bandwidth by end-customers and the applications they use. As a result, service providers and enterprises are adding key enabling technologies to their networks for increased flexibility, programmability, scalability, reliability, and to enable new applications and services with an expedited time to market. These investments provide a competitive advantage and bring value-added services to increase network efficiency, increase customer satisfaction and produce new revenue streams. Within these broad industry themes, investment in our products and services is driven by several key industry trends and strategy priorities.
Deployment of 5G Mobile Technology
We believe one of the most significant investments underway by mobile carriers across the world is the deployment of 5G broadband cellular technology. This architecture shift impacts the entire ecosystem, from handsets and Radio Access Network through the metro and core network and back-office systems. The ultimate goal is a step-function improvement in capacity and coverage, as well as to unlock new revenue generating applications for consumers and businesses. We believe new mobile applications will emerge, such as Reality/Virtual Reality ("R/VR"), cloud gaming, telehealth, Internet of Things ("IoT"), and Industry 4.0, all made possible by the massive bandwidth increases, low latency and highly secure infrastructure that 5G provides.
The investment is not limited to the mobile infrastructure itself; enhancements are needed at the data transport and management layers of the network as well, driving fiber and IP Networking to the very edges of the network. This investment cycle and technology disruption is an opportunity for new innovative suppliers to be selected.
Demand for Hyper-Connectivity and Bandwidth Driving Fiber Access Deployment
Our global information society is overflowing with telecommunications data traffic, for business, entertainment, education, surveillance, industrial control, online retail, and many other applications. These applications, increasingly delivered from the cloud, generate a huge amount of data driven largely by the video and image components. This exponential growth in data traffic is expected to continue and even accelerate, straining existing broadband and mobile networks. While 5G, and next generation WiFi, are the technologies of choice for the wireless network, there is also a surge of investment targeted at addressing the bottle neck of the broadband access network with higher capacity fiber connections.
Governments in many countries around the world are investing to address and help close the “Digital Divide” and extend ultra-broadband services and connectivity to underserved communities. As an example, in the United States, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the FCC Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ("RDOF"), the 5G Fund for Rural America, and the USDA Rural Development Broadband ReConnect Program expect to provide billions of dollars in funding to deliver broadband connectivity to rural communities in the U.S. Whether working or learning from home, streaming 4K television, or playing the latest online video games, rural subscribers demand dependable, high-speed Internet access to participate and thrive in the digital world. Forward-looking service providers are taking advantage of government funding programs to expand network capacity and transform the communities they serve. Next-generation rural broadband networks help service providers grow their revenues by extending service reach and diversity, and by satisfying the massive pent-up demand for high-speed Internet connectivity. Next-generation broadband networks will also leverage new technologies like fixed-wireless access, while laying the foundation for future revenue opportunities like 5G backhaul transport services.
At the foundation, high performance Optical connections and advanced IP networking are needed to keep pace with the advancements in communications. This hyper-connectivity will be a key enabler and deliver disruptive ultra-low cost-per-bit communications within and between networks and the cloud, while also delivering on the promise of latency sensitive networking demanded by many of the applications.
Increased Adoption of Cloud Communications and Collaboration
The shift to cloud-based communications began several years ago driven largely by the advantages of running applications in a virtual cloud environment and reducing dependency on on-premises computing and communications technologies. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic accelerated this trend significantly, driven by the need for more remote working and commerce for many businesses and industries. As a result, businesses and consumers have rapidly shifted from brick-and-mortar facilities and travel to work-from-home, or hybrid work-in-the-office and work-from home, using cloud communications and collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom Phone and others, and require these communications platforms to be highly secure and scalable.
Evolution of Communications Service Provider Networks to Reduce Total Cost of Ownership
CSPs of all types continue to face challenges to their businesses because of the significant technological evolution, increasing competition, disruption by Over-the-Top ("OTT") providers (those providing video entertainment over the Internet rather than through traditional cable, telco and satellite networks), and shifts in customer expectations. They also need to drive new revenues with more digital, efficient, automated, secure, and reliable networks driven largely by software, automation, cloud networking, and other technologies such as analytics and machine-learning. All these factors are causing service providers to re-think and evolve, or even over-haul, the way networks are designed, architected, managed, and optimized to deliver services to their customers with disruptive economics. They are migrating their networks and services software to run on private and/or public clouds (referred to as the "Telco Cloud") using cloud-native technologies, architectures and operational processes with automation and concepts such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery ("CI/CD"). Increasingly, network operators are also pursuing open, multi-layer optimized and disaggregated IP and Optical networking solutions, where they have the flexibility to assemble networks based on transport and control subsystems from different vendors with software-defined networking. 
Service providers in some global regions, as mandated by governments or voluntarily, are also replacing certain incumbent vendor communications equipment and technology in their networks because of concerns for security. This presents a significant growth and market share opportunity.
This technology evolution challenge extends beyond service providers to many enterprises as well as Federal, State, and Local governments. In particular, the US Federal government and agencies have a significant need to modernize their voice communications infrastructure, replacing legacy on-premise systems with modern cloud-based voice and video solutions. However, the unique requirements regarding security and survivability are not easily met by off-the-shelf enterprise applications, creating significant opportunity for companies that specialize in this area.
Need for Reliable, Secure, High-Bandwidth Enterprise and Critical Infrastructure Communications
The “critical infrastructure” market vertical is defined as those companies whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered vital to a country’s national interest. Critical infrastructure providers are under increasing pressure to support new services, reduce carbon emission, improve security, expand automation, and increase safety. Achieving these goals requires a transition to a modernized, secure communications network that provides seamless IP connectivity and services and very high capacity optical transport. With an integrated IP and optical transport solution, a critical infrastructure network operator can provide a highly reliable, secure, future proof communications solution optimized for critical industries. An essential requirement for this solution includes a security suite that incorporates state-of-the-art operational technologies protection measures, giving operators extra confidence in the security of their network.
Data is the lifeblood of any business, and it must be easily accessible across the enterprise to power business applications and to support services to end-customers. It must also be replicated across multiple locations for business continuity and disaster recovery and must be protected from inappropriate access, theft, and corruption. Enterprises deploy optical networking, secured by optical encryption, to attain the needed performance and security. Similarly, command and control groups within today’s armed forces have a need for high performance secure networks as their strategic sensors and assault systems are becoming more integrated. In this ecosystem, effective decision-making requires the pooling and analysis of data from a vast array of sensors and other information sources. The data must be delivered securely, in real-time, to wherever it is required. These solutions integrate intelligent optical transport with agile IP networking to provide a converged, secure, communication network.
Strategy Overview
Our mission is to create a recognized global technology leader providing open, cloud-centric solutions spanning multiple network layers that enable the secure exchange of communications and information, with unparalleled scale, performance, and elasticity. Our transformative acquisition of ECI in 2020 dramatically expanded our addressable market beyond secure voice communications into IP Networking, Optical Transport, and Software-Defined Networking ("SDN") Management and Automation. We are implementing a focused strategy to target our broad global base of Service Provider and Enterprise customers to establish Ribbon as key supplier of networking solutions. Key elements of the strategy include:
•Operational Integration – In order to provide laser focus on the unique aspects of our portfolio, a business unit model was initially adopted along with regional sales teams and an integrated corporate organization. This has served us well over the last three years. However, we are seeing a growing number of opportunities where closer collaboration would be beneficial. As a result, in 2023 we have re-organized the Company and created a single leader for both of our segments with the establishment of a Chief Operating Officer role. Similarly, the go-to-market team has been unified with the establishment of a single Global Sales Leader role. Internally we launched the "Ribbon 3.0" program, reflecting the continued transformation of the Company and a drive towards best-in-class operational efficiencies and execution. 
•Cross-Selling and Tier One Service Provider Growth - We are laser-focused on marketing and selling our combined post-acquisition broad portfolio to our global deployed base of service provider and enterprise customers to expand our presence and share of the larger IP and Optical networking and transport market and cross-sell our complete portfolio. In particular, we are focused on penetrating the largest service providers around the world in order to drive long term growth and improved competitiveness. 

•North American IP Optical Networks Market Share – We expect to continue to unlock the value of our former ECI portfolio by growing IP Optical Networks market share in the North American market by leveraging the extensive deployment base and ongoing business that we have with service providers and enterprise customers. We have identified opportunities where we have been able to combine technology from both our Voice and IP Routing portfolios in order to address a clear customer need and differentiate our offering. We continue to build on early cross-selling successes and have multiple promising pipeline opportunities in progress for 2023. 

•Participate in the 5G Opportunity – We have made significant Research & Development ("R&D") investments in our IP Optical product portfolio in order to address multiple opportunities tied to the deployment of 5G mobile networks. We want to be at the forefront of preparing our customers for the deployment of 5G on two major fronts: providing for metro, backhaul and long-haul transport and networking solutions in service provider networks, industrial verticals, and critical infrastructure; and supporting their needs as new applications, including IoT and AI, become a reality with 5G. We believe 5G is a multi-year opportunity as global service providers roll out the new capital-intensive technology and build out the needed network infrastructure over the next decade. We have reported several recent strategic wins in this area, and believe this will be a key catalyst for growth. As an example, we have recently been selected by Bharti Airtel in India to provide a Cell Site Router (CSR) IP platform as they launch 5G mobile services in the country. In addition, Bharti has also selected our Apollo Optical Transport platform for Long Haul DWDM transport. Similarly, Rogers in Canada is deploying our Apollo solution for both mobile and fixed broadband services.

•Software-Centric and Cloud-Native Offerings - The value of virtual, cloud-native, and software-driven solutions deployable in the cloud has only grown because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the migration of network services to the Telco Cloud, which underscores another area of major focus for us. As a strategy, we continue to aggressively transition a significant portion of our product portfolio and business model towards more software, cloud-native offerings with automation and as-a-Service selling model. We believe this transition is instrumental in continuing to improve our profitability and competitiveness, and in growing the recurring revenue portion of our business. 

•Enterprise Offerings - The market need and growth rate are higher at the network edge than at the core. We are focused on growing this area of our business through our overall enterprise solutions for securing communications and our IP optical network connectivity solutions, which together are typically geared towards critical infrastructure, large enterprises, and medium-size businesses, building on our partnerships with key go-to-market channels and solutions providers such as Microsoft, as well as other popular unified communications and collaboration ("UC&C") platforms such as Zoom Phone and similar service provider UC&C offerings. 

•Partnerships - We continually look to form industry partnerships that will enhance our current solution offerings to our customers.

Manufacturing
We rely on global contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers to manufacture, assemble, test and ship our products. We typically utilize long-term relationships with our contract manufacturers and regularly review business relationships in an attempt to reduce cost of goods and supply risks. We employ formal quality, environmental and ethics management programs with all of our contract manufacturers. 
Our leading manufacturers have presence in multiple international locations. This enables us to implement a flexible manufacturing and logistics landscape for each product line and target markets. This structure also facilitates redundancy and business continuity to mitigate risks related to adverse trade tariff, taxation, and natural disasters. Moreover, we wholly own the intellectual property related to fabrication files, assembly, testing algorithms and manufacturing operating procedures, thus reducing sole dependency on a specific contract manufacturer.
Inventory Suppliers and Sourcing
We work with strategic global suppliers for our key integrated circuit components, systems, and software. Certain of our networking products use third-party optical modules embedded on board or configured as pluggable units. These modules are designed and manufactured by leading optical technology vendors and supplied to us based on agreed-upon controlled performance specifications.
Our policy is to purchase major components directly from original suppliers or from authorized distributors. We regularly review market trends and volume demand for newly introduced products with our suppliers and distributors to negotiate reduced component pricing as the products mature. We carefully manage end-of-sale and end-of-life transitions to maximize return on investment and minimize wasted material, while maximizing customer satisfaction. When we must source such end-of-life components from distributors and brokers, we typically encounter increased component pricing. In some cases, when such parts cannot be sourced reliably any longer in the open market, we undertake redesign efforts with alternative components.
In order to maintain competitive lead time for our customers, we employ sophisticated demand and supply management systems. We also utilize agility and safety stock processes to help meet higher-than-forecasted customer demand to stock raw material and sub-assembly inventory. We occasionally experience unforeseen demand drops of certain products or sub-assemblies due to technology evolution, customer consumption behavior, or shortened product lifecycle. For example, we encountered supply chain disruptions in 2021 due to component demand and logistics complications. We regularly review current inventory levels to ensure adequate reserves for excess and obsolete inventory arising from shortened product life cycle or demand drops.
The worldwide supply chain disruptions that started mid-2020 have affected multiple aspects of our product realization processes, including extended component lead-times, part shortages, higher input costs, and increased logistics complexity. While this has moderated somewhat in the second half of 2022 and into 2023, issues remain and continue to affect our delivery execution and profitability. We continue to implement specific actions to manage these issues, including investment in key component inventory and re-design of sub-assemblies to improve product availability. 
We occasionally experience unforeseen demand drops of certain products or sub-assemblies due to technology evolution, customer consumption behavior, or shortened product lifecycle. We regularly review current inventory levels to ensure adequate reserves for excess and obsolete inventory arising from shortened product life cycle or demand drops.

This allows us to distribute work in a cost-effective manner and provide time-zone sensitive support to our global sales team and customers. We supplement our deep in-house expertise with a small set of long-term contracting partners, allowing us to flex up and down as required to match customer demand. 
To maintain our position as a technology leader, we continue to invest in our development methodologies, leveraging and adopting industry best practices in the domains of DevOPs, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery ("CI/CD"), cloud-native software, Security and Test Automation.
In addition to delivering product-specific feature requests from our customers, our R&D resources that are focused on our Cloud and Edge business segment continue to focus on leading edge technology that will allow our customers to move from purpose-built appliances to fully virtualized and cloud-native solutions, including private, public, hybrid and multi-cloud deployment models as they modernize their networks. We are also investing in aaS variants of our products, fully integrated with cloud-native operational models.
Our IP Optical Networks R&D team continues to focus on empowering our customers with better performance and cost-efficient solutions, improved cost-per-bit, and reduced power and space requirements to lower operating costs. We create innovative solutions that address the exponential increases in bandwidth consumption with improving operational efficiency. Our unique value-add is demonstrated by advanced well-integrated optical and packet solutions managed by state-of-the-art cross platform SDN management system. We are also investing in open and optimized IP and Optical solutions as well as disaggregated networking solutions for our customers.
We leverage modern technologies and industry best practices across all of our products and solutions to provide security at each layer of the solution, enabling end to end security of the overall system. We continue to invest in analytics and automation to allow our customers to operate our solutions at scale with end-to-end visibility and control over the robustness, security, and efficiency of the solution.
Intellectual Property
We believe intellectual property is fundamental to our business and success, and we depend upon our ability to develop, maintain and protect our technology. We seek to safeguard our investments in technology and rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As of December 31, 2022, we had been issued 669 patents in the U.S., which expire between 2023 and 2041, and had 44 in-process patent applications in the U.S. As of such date, we also had 276 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions, and had 16 patent applications. As of December 31, 2022, we had 34 trademarks registered in the U.S. and 118 trademarks registered in foreign jurisdictions.
In addition to the protections described above, we seek to safeguard our intellectual property by employing measures to protect against the unauthorized use or disclosure of the source and object code for our software, documentation and other written materials; licensing our software pursuant to signed license agreements, which impose restrictions on others' ability to use our software; and seeking to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements.
We have incorporated third-party licensed technology into certain of our products and may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop new products or to enhance existing products. Although many companies are often willing to enter into such licensing agreements, no assurance can be provided that such licenses can be negotiated on reasonable terms, or at all. The failure to enter into technology development or licensing agreements, when necessary, could limit our ability to develop new products and could harm our business.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights as discussed above, unauthorized parties may still obtain and use our technology and software. We have defended, and intend to vigorously defend when necessary, our intellectual property from infringement. Other companies in the communications and technology industries frequently threaten litigation or file suit against us (directly or indirectly through customers to whom we could owe indemnification) based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We are currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including those of our competitors and non-practicing entities.
Regulatory Considerations
As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, among others. In addition, our operations are also subject to a number of environmental regulations such as the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") and the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("RoHS"). We have developed policies and 
procedures to assist us in complying with these laws and regulations. Our historical compliance costs, including those related to environmental regulations, have not resulted in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We expect the laws and regulations to which we are subject will continue to increase and the future costs of compliance with existing or new regulations could materially impact our business in the future.
Our Employees
As a global company with employees in more than 30 countries, we focus on creating an inclusive global community, aligning our resources, processes, and platforms to build a work culture that reflects and expresses our core values. This enables us to work efficiently across borders and functions. Our aim is to create a workplace that is engaging, inspiring, challenging, and inclusive. We strive to be a great employer for our current employees and for future employees who are seeking an opportunity to join our dynamic business, positioned at the nexus of global communications technology and social transformation.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 3,394 employees worldwide, located geographically as follows:

 | Number of employees | Percentage of total
Asia | 1,276 | | 38 | %
North America | 943 | | 28 | %
EMEA | 1,056 | | 31 | %
LATAM | 119 | | 3 | %

Approximately 726 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good.
Ribbon's core values are focused on teamwork, passion (taking pride in our achievements), being a trusted advisor to our customers, innovation and being "TRUE" - Transparent, Respectful, Unpretentious and Empowered. We leverage these values to engage our employees, providing a workplace in which we all work with shared objectives that contribute to a successful business, better society, and a better world. We also offer our employees opportunities for personal and professional growth, while maintaining a culture of open and transparent communications where everyone receives constructive performance feedback and is encouraged to offer new ideas about any aspect of the work we do and our ways of doing things.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI"). We believe that having a diverse group of people who contribute different perspectives and viewpoints is both the right thing to do and a serious competitive advantage, critical to the success of any organization. Our goal is to continue to promote an environment that encourages all team members, regardless of race, sex, background, or affiliation, to take pride in their individual contributions. In 2021, Ribbon introduced the DEI Council as part of our commitment to further our awareness of the different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences of our employees and to operationalize our efforts to build on these assets. The DEI Council is composed of leaders representing all functions and geographies who are dedicated to creating greater awareness and education about DEI, setting priorities, and developing programs to fulfill these objectives in coordination with Human Resources (“HR”) and other internal stakeholders. There were several key objectives in 2022, and one of our main areas of focus was to address the imbalance between the number of men and women in the company, a pervasive issue throughout the technology industry. In addition, we wanted to enhance awareness of the impact of DEI company-wide, addressing any bias in our recruiting process, and strengthening the women’s leadership community. 
Our initial DEI strategy is to achieve stronger representation of women in a variety of roles at all levels of the organization, with an emphasis on women in management. As of December 31, 2022, 23% of our employees identified as female and those 770 employees are located geographically as follows:

 | Percentage of employees identifying as female
Asia | 41 | %
North America | 24 | %
EMEA | 32 | %
LATAM | 3 | %

Employee Hiring, Turnover and Engagement. We continue to monitor our overall employee engagement through HR metrics, such as total number of hires, voluntary turnover rates, new hire surveys, exit interviews and our annual employment 
engagement survey. We know that successful employee engagement helps increase employee attraction and retention. The 2022 job market was very competitive, especially in the technology sector. The challenging environment for both hiring and retaining talent resulted in increased time to hire and turnover rates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we hired 407 employees, a decrease of 28% from the number of employees hired in 2021, and our voluntary employee turnover rate in 2022 was 13.3% globally. 
Another way we measure employee engagement is through our recently launched recognition program, “Real Time Rewards.” This program not only helps with engagement, but reinforces our “thank you culture.” Employees at Ribbon are able to recognize the achievements and contributions of their teammates, peers, and managers. In 2022, approximately 4,000 such awards were given, whereby 44% of our employees was recognized and rewarded for their contributions. These rewards are comprised of both monetary and non-monetary awards and are also used to recognize service anniversaries, birthdays, and other notable events. 
Like many companies in our industry, voluntary attrition has increased significantly compared to prior years. We continue to review the reasons provided by departing employees and have taken a number of actions to address these concerns, including expanding our Learning and Development programs, introducing Leadership Development for all levels of management and others, and establishing an annual focal compensation review, resulting in salary increases to remain competitive in local markets. In addition, we continue to benchmark employee benefits and welfare programs. All of these enhancements are to ensure we retain our key employees in a very competitive global employment market and provide additional targeted employee engagement in regional locations or functions with higher attrition.
Learning and Development (L&D). We believe that investing in our employees' personal and professional development enables them to perform their current roles with maximum effectiveness and to be prepared for roles of greater responsibility in the future. Our strong L&D programs deliver employee empowerment, boost workplace engagement and relationships, and retain talent. These learning programs utilize a combination of in-person and online curriculum and include core modules, some of which are mandatory, relating to ethical conduct, products and services, cyber security, safety, human rights and anti-corruption, as well as additional tailored programs on topics such as leadership, management, excellence in service, project management and competency development. In 2022, we delivered more than 20 live training webinars, 10 manager/leader development programs, and approximately 13 training hours per employee across our workforce, an increase from approximately 11 hours in 2021.
Safety, Health and Well-being. We strive for a workplace that is free of hazards for our employees. We take care to comply with applicable safety regulations and have a strong track record for safety which we reinforce through regular training modules in all of our locations. In 2022, Ribbon launched global Employee Assistance Programs (“EAP”) to employees and their families in all countries in which Ribbon operates. The EAP is a confidential support service that can help our employees and their dependents at no cost. The EAP Care Access Centre can be contacted toll-free, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.
As a company that advocates a healthy and balanced lifestyle, we launched the Ribbon Wellness Program which is available to Ribbon employees and their families. This program includes a variety of monthly wellness related topics delivered through activities such as webinars, exercise sessions, and engaging challenges. Topics covered in 2022 included healthy nutrition, stress management, fitness and physical health, as well as mental and emotional health.
As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted a phased return to occupancy plan that provided for a gradual return of employees to our offices (typically two to three days per week) based on the conditions in the geographic region and in alignment with local regulations. In the second half of 2022, we adopted a Hybrid Work Model where employees spend a minimum of two days per week working from a Ribbon office to encourage collaboration, innovation, and socialization, but maintain the flexibility to work remotely as well. We have received positive feedback from employees who appreciate the flexibility Ribbon offers and how it has improved their work-life balance. We continue to provide regular communications to our employees to update them on our policies and maintain a COVID-19 resource site that includes information and resources on working from home and links to official resources from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, and others.
Community Investment. We value the communities in which we work. We encourage a service mindset among our employees wherever they are and support community involvement and engagement. Our Employee Engagement committees have developed ongoing relationships with local Non-Profit organizations where Ribbon and our employees are contributing both time and funds to provide needed support. Ribbon also sponsors events and campaigns that support organizations such as the American Heart Association, Make a Wish Foundation, and the United Way. In addition, since 2010, we have provided a day 
of paid time off for all employees to participate in our Global Day of Service, during which employees and their families are encouraged to volunteer and contribute to local charitable organizations in their communities.

Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility
We are committed to operating ethically, efficiently and inclusively. We believe we contribute to the communities in which we operate through the mitigation of climate change and other global sustainable development priorities. We aim to help improve the quality of the lives of people, society and the health of the planet through leveraging our expertise in transforming networks, enhancing security and delivering world-class solutions. We believe that communications technology and continuous innovation form the backbone upon which sustainable development largely depends. Major technology trends supported by our solutions include the accelerated adoption of collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom; the 5G revolution; accelerating customers' ability to transfer carbon-intensive data storage from using local physical environments to the cloud; supporting service providers’ increased network demands to allow more people to work from home; and using our analytics solutions to maximize network efficiencies.
We have taken a more strategic position to our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices. Our ESG materiality study reviewed the expectations and requirements of both our stakeholders and our competitors to focus on the ESG practices that are most critical to our business and those where we believe we can make the largest positive impact. From this materiality study, we published a strategy which we believe will positively impact our future environmental performance, and deliver social benefits for our customers, employees and society at large. Additionally, we believe the governance improvements made as a result of our strategy will result in enhancements in our accountability and that of our suppliers and partners. 
We are committed to protecting the environment and preventing pollution within a product's lifecycle through responsible product design and requiring suppliers to adhere to sustainable practices. An example of this is our focus on continuously improving the power and space efficiency of our products to reduce overall energy consumption in our customers' networks at our own facilities. We align our compliance goals with component directives such as RoHS legislation in the European Union and China and with the European WEEE directive. We also hold a host of internationally recognized certifications for our global offerings, including ISO 9001: 2015 - Quality Management Systems; ISO 14001: 2015 - Environmental Management Systems; and SI 10000: 2013 - Social Responsibility (covering our sites in Israel).
It has always been paramount to our way of doing business to act with the utmost integrity, honesty and transparency. Our commitment to ethical business practices guide us in our compliance with national and international laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery and unfair competition, antitrust and human rights. We maintain a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our directors, employees, contractors and suppliers. We are committed to strong corporate governance practices, which include building long-term value and assuring success for our stockholders and other stakeholders, including employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.

Seasonality
We have experienced quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience increases in order volume in the fourth quarter due to greater spending on operating and capital expenditures by our service provider customers. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the beginning of the calendar year, when our service provider customers are operationalizing their annual budgets and plans, which may result in lower revenue in the first quarter. These typical seasonal effects may vary. Accordingly, they should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future operating results.
