Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a multi-asset, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing novel treatments for multi-drug resistant, or MDR, bacterial infections. Our most advanced product candidate, SPR994 (also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide), is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat

MDR Gram-negative infections. Treatment with effective orally administrable antibiotics may prevent hospitalizations for serious infections and enable earlier, more convenient and cost-effective treatment of patients after hospitalization. We also have a platform technology known as our Potentiator Platform, which includes two intravenous, or IV-administered agents, SPR206 and SPR741, that are active either alone or in combination with other standard of care agents and are designed to treat MDR Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital. In addition, we are developing SPR720, an oral antibiotic designed for the treatment of a rare, orphan disease called pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection, or NTM infection. We believe that our novel product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, would have a meaningful patient impact and significant commercial applications for the treatment of MDR infections in both the community and hospital settings.
 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are one of the largest threats to global health, and their prevalence is increasing. While the majority of life-threatening infections historically resulting from antibiotic-resistant bacteria are acquired in the hospital setting, there is an increasing incidence of MDR pathogens in the community setting. Antibiotics used currently for first-line empiric treatment of MDR bacterial infections suffer from significant limitations and risks, including narrow spectrums of coverage and safety and tolerability concerns, and they can be associated with serious adverse effects. In addition, there are no oral antibiotics commercially available that can reliably be used in adults with MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections. This limits the ability of physicians to prevent hospitalizations and transition patients home from the hospital after receiving IV-administered therapy. The increasing prevalence of drug resistance and MDR Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the limitations of existing therapies and traditional drug development approaches, highlight the critical need for novel therapies, and in particular orally administrable agents, that are capable of overcoming these obstacles to effective patient treatment.
 To address the foregoing, we are developing a portfolio of novel product candidates, including:
  
• | Oral SPR994: Novel Antibiotic with Potential to be the First Broad-Spectrum Oral Carbapenem for Use in Adults. SPR994, also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide, is our novel oral formulation of tebipenem, a carbapenem-class antibiotic marketed by Meiji Seika Pharma Co. Ltd., or Meiji, in Japan as Orapenem since 2009 for common pediatric infections. Carbapenems are an important class of antibiotics because they are safe and effective against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections. Carbapenem use has increased dramatically as a result of the rising resistance to commonly used agents such as fluoroquinolones and cephalosporin antibiotics. Carbapenems are now considered as the standard-of-care for treating these resistant bacteria, but they are currently only available intravenously for such indications. In September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers. Based on discussion from our pre-Phase 3 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and positive results from the final analysis of our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in complicated urinary tract infections, or cUTI, demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. In February 2019, we received FDA acceptance of our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for SPR994 in cUTI. We intend to advance SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg administered three times per day, or TID, into a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, called ADAPT-PO, in patients with cUTI. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment. In addition to cUTI, we believe that SPR994 has the potential to treat other serious and life-threatening infections, including community acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, for which we could receive funding support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, subject to BARDA exercising future options under our BARDA award, as further described in this section.

Prior Safety and Efficacy Experience with Tebipenem Pivoxil in Japan
 Our clinical strategy is supported by extensive safety data underlying tebipenem pivoxil’s regulatory approval in Japan and long-standing use in Japan for common pediatric infections. Approximately 1,200 subjects, including approximately 741 adults, have been dosed with tebipenem pivoxil at a range of doses in clinical and pharmacologic studies. In addition, Meiji has completed a post-market study including 3,540 patients following the safety and tolerability of tebipenem pivoxil at the approved dose. In addition, two exploratory Phase 2 trials were conducted in Japan in patients with cUTI, the first indication in which we intend to study for SPR994. We have the rights to all the registration and post-marketing studies.
 In addition, we received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation from the FDA for SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, or CABP, and moderate to severe diabetic foot infections, or DFI. The QIDP designation was created by the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now, or GAIN, Act and creates incentives for the development of certain antibiotics that treat serious or life-threatening infections. QIDP designation entitles us to priority review of SPR994 for regulatory approval by the FDA. The QIDP designation for SPR994, however, does not guarantee a faster development process or ensure FDA approval.

We have global commercialization rights to SPR994, except in certain contractually specified Asian countries. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio will provide us global protection for SPR994, including in the United States and Europe, through 2038.
  
• | IV Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741): Our Technology Designed to Treat Infections Caused by MDR Gram-Negative Bacteria in the Hospital Setting. Our Potentiator Platform is our novel and proprietary technology that we believe will enable us to develop drugs against MDR Gram-negative bacteria, a subset of bacterial organisms distinguished by the presence of an outer cell membrane. Our IV Potentiator Platform molecules are designed to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections through interactions with the bacteria’s outer cell membrane either as a monotherapy or by co-administering our Potentiator molecules with currently approved antibiotics, potentially making the existing antibiotics more effective by clearing a path for them to enter and kill the bacteria.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have two IV Potentiator Platform product candidates, SPR206 and SPR741. SPR206 is a direct acting IV-administered agent that has demonstrated single-agent antibacterial activity in preclinical studies against MDR Gram-negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SPR741 is an IV-administered agent to be used in combination that has demonstrated in vitro the ability to expand the spectrum and increase the potency of a co-administered antibiotic. Both have demonstrated potency against Gram-negative bacteria, including organisms identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and the World Health Organization, or WHO, as urgent and serious threats to human health.
 SPR206
 We continue to progress the development of our direct acting Potentiator Platform molecules, exemplified by our product candidate SPR206. In preclinical studies, SPR206 showed activity as a single agent against MDR and extensively drug resistant, or XDR, bacterial strains, including isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in both in vitro and in vivo models of infection. We have completed a preclinical toxicology study of SPR206 in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, requirements. Data from recent preclinical studies of SPR206 suggest a potency and safety profile for SPR206 that may be superior to SPR741, and we believe SPR206 may have a potentially faster path to pivotal clinical trials when compared with SPR741 because SPR206 is being developed as a single agent. In May 2018, we announced preclinical toxicology and efficacy data that we believe support advancing SPR206 into clinical development. In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR206, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019. We were granted QIDP designation by the FDA for SPR206 in October 2018 for the treatment of cUTI and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, or HABP/VABP.
 We have multiple patent applications pending for SPR206 that we believe will provide SPR206 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2039.
 SPR741
 The first clinical trial of SPR741 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort trial. The trial was conducted in two parts, a SAD and a MAD. The SAD part of the trial was a single ascending dose design, with subjects receiving one dose of SPR741. The MAD part was a multiple ascending dose design, with subjects receiving repeat dosing over a period of 14 days. In both study parts, sequential cohorts were exposed to increasing doses of SPR741.
 Generally, there were no dose-related or treatment-related trends in any of the safety and tolerability endpoints for SPR741 when administered as single doses up to and including 800 mg or multiple doses up to and including 600 mg every 8 hours for 14 days.
 Following the completion of our first clinical trial, in late November 2017, we initiated our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom. The Phase 1b trial enrolled 27 healthy volunteers to evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SPR741 as a single dose in combination with some commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins (ceftazidime), monobactams (aztreonam) and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (piperacillin/tazobactam). In this Phase 1b drug-drug interaction study, we observed no impact on the tolerability or standalone pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the beta-lactam drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose, supporting further development of SPR741 as a combination agent for the treatment of MDR Gram-negative infections.

We believe that our intellectual property portfolio for SPR741 will provide SPR741 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2039. 
 As previously disclosed, we expect to select either SPR741 or SPR206 to bring forward as our lead Potentiator Platform product candidate, based on our evaluation of available clinical data for each candidate and other factors, and we expect to seek partnering opportunities or other non-dilutive funding for further clinical development of the Potentiator Platform candidate we elect to deprioritize. In light of the positive data from our preclinical toxicology studies of SPR206, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR206 in December 2018 designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019. We expect that data from this Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR206, together with the data from our completed Phase 1b clinical trial of SPR741, will enable us to select a lead Potentiator Platform product candidate to advance into late-stage development. Our current view is that a prioritization decision can best be made after each of our Potentiator Platform candidates has achieved a similar clinical development stage. Until such time, we expect to continue to assess clinical development strategies, partnering opportunities and non-dilutive funding for both of our Potentiator Platform product candidates.
  
• | Oral SPR720: Novel Oral Antibiotic Designed for Treatment of Pulmonary Non-tuberculous Mycobacterial Infections. SPR720 is our novel orally available product candidate designed for the treatment for NTM infection. Lung infections caused by NTM are rare, and occur most frequently in patients with compromised immune systems or abnormal pulmonary anatomy. Such conditions include human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, or respiratory conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and bronchiectasis. The annual prevalence of NTM infection is increasing at an estimated rate of 8% per year. The current treatment for NTM infection is at least twelve months and involves combination therapy, often including three or more antibiotics, including some, such as aminoglycosides, that are parenterally administered. There are currently no oral treatments specifically approved for use in NTM infection. Treatment failure is common and is often due to lack of clearance of bacteria, no impact on patients’ quality of life, poor compliance or patients’ inability to tolerate the regimen. Many patients experience progressive lung disease and mortality is high. We believe SPR720, if successfully developed, has the potential to be the first oral antibiotic specifically approved for the treatment of this debilitating rare disease. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the potency of SPR720 against a range of bacteria causing NTM infection, including both Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus, a highly resistant strain causing infections with high mortality.

 In November 2018 we announced positive results from preclinical IND-enabling studies of SPR720. SPR720 was assessed in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. Results from in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. We believe these results, in conjunction with recent regulatory interactions, support the further development of SPR720. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720 in January 2019, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects, and expect top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019. In February 2019, we received QIDP designation for SPR720 for the treatment of lung infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria and for the treatment of lung infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QIDP designation entitles us to priority review of SPR720 for regulatory approval by the FDA. The QIDP designation for SPR720, however, does not guarantee a faster development process or ensure FDA approval.
 We believe that our intellectual property portfolio for SPR720 will provide protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2033.
 Recent Developments
 SPR994 Phase 1 Final Results and Dose Selection Data Supporting Planned Single Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 In September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers. The final data support the advancement of SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg administered TID into our planned ADAPT-PO pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. Following positive feedback from the FDA from our pre-Phase 3 meeting, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. As a result of the meeting, we submitted an IND application for SPR994 in cUTI with the FDA,

and in February 2019 we received FDA acceptance of our IND application for SPR994 in cUTI. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment.
 SPR720 Preclinical Data Supports Advancement into Phase 1 Clinical Trials
 In November 2018, we announced positive results from preclinical IND-enabling studies of SPR720, our oral antimicrobial agent being developed for the treatment of NTM infections. SPR720 was assessed in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicology studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. Results from in vitro MIC studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. We believe these results, in conjunction with recent regulatory interactions, support the further development of SPR720. In January 2019, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720 in January 2019, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019. In addition, in February 2019, we received QIDP designation for SPR720 for the treatment of lung infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria and for the treatment of lung infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. QIDP designation entitles us to priority review of SPR720 for regulatory approval by the FDA. The QIDP designation for SPR720, however, does not guarantee a faster development process or ensure FDA approval.
SPR206 License Agreement with Everest Medicines
 On January 4, 2019, the Company, through our wholly owned subsidiary New Pharma License Holdings Limited, or NPLH, entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines II Limited, or Everest, whereby we granted Everest an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206, or products containing SPR206, in Greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries. We retained development, manufacturing and commercialization rights with respect to SPR206 and Licensed Products in the rest of the world and also retained the right to develop or manufacture SPR206 and Licensed Products in the Territory for use outside the Territory. In addition to the license grant with respect to SPR206, we also granted to Everest a 12-month exclusive option to negotiate with us for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture or commercialize SPR741 in the same territories. We received from Everest an upfront payment of $3.0 million and are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to an additional $59.5 million upon Everest’s achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones related to SPR206, of which we anticipate receiving at least $2.0 million in near-term milestones during 2019. Furthermore, we are eligible to receive high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net sales of products containing SPR206 in the covered territories following regulatory approval of SPR206.

Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to identify, develop and commercialize novel treatments for MDR bacterial infections, focusing on areas of high unmet medical need for safe and effective antibiotic treatments. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Advance our lead product candidate SPR994 through clinical development and regulatory approval. We initiated a Phase 1 dose-selection clinical trial of SPR994 in Australia in October 2017. In September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers and identified a dose of 600 mg TID for our planned ADAPT-PO single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI. Our Phase 3 trial is designed to show that oral SPR994 is non-inferior to IV ertapenem and has a similar safety profile, supporting SPR994’s value proposition of getting patients out of the hospital earlier or keeping them out of the hospital. In February 2019, we announced the FDA’s acceptance of our IND application for SPR994 in cUTI. In addition to cUTI, we believe that SPR994 has the potential to treat other serious and life-threatening infections, including community acquired pneumonia, or CAP. In addition, our SPR994 collaboration with BARDA, which is further described elsewhere in this Business section, could provide funding for a possible clinical trial in pneumonia patients if BARDA elects to exercise its options under our BARDA award.

• | Establish global commercialization and marketing capabilities. We have global commercialization rights to all of our product candidates, with the exception of SPR994 in certain contractually specified Asian countries. Our management team has significant expertise in the commercialization of infectious disease treatments. Prior to joining us, members of our management team have collectively played leading roles in the approval and launch of 11 infectious disease products. We intend to build a targeted sales force and directly commercialize our product candidates in the United States in both hospital and community settings. Outside the United States, we intend to enter into collaborations with third parties to develop and market our product candidates in targeted geographical markets. By collaborating with companies that have an existing commercial presence and experience in such markets, we believe we can efficiently maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates.

• | Diversify into rare orphan infectious disease markets such as NTM infection. We believe there is a significant opportunity to develop products for underserved “orphan” infectious disease areas, such as NTM infection. These markets offer the attributes of fewer branded or generic competitors as well as chronic therapy. We believe our drug candidate SPR720 has the potential to be the first oral antibiotic approved for the treatment of pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. We may seek to acquire other product candidates for other underserved, debilitating orphan infectious diseases. We intend to continue to advance SPR720 through clinical development. In January 2019, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 trial for SPR720 and expect to receive top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance a product candidate from our IV Potentiator Platform through clinical development and regulatory approval, either through a collaboration or with non-dilutive funding (or both). In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 trial of SPR206 in healthy subjects. Data from recent preclinical studies of SPR206 suggest a potency and safety profile that may be superior to SPR741, and we believe SPR206 may have a potentially faster path to pivotal clinical trials compared with SPR741 because SPR206 is being developed as a single agent. We expect to decide which of these product candidates we will bring forward as our lead clinical Potentiator product candidate based on data from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR206, which we expect to receive in the second half of 2019, and data from our completed Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR741. We may seek partnering opportunities or other non-dilutive funding for further clinical development of the Potentiator candidate we elect to deprioritize.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the value of our pipeline through collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies. We may elect to pursue strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage our Potentiator Platform. We believe it may be beneficial to develop and commercialize one or more of our Potentiator product candidates through partnering opportunities. Such collaborations may include regional collaborations to advance the entire Potentiator Platform, or product-specific deals pairing our product candidates with collaborators’ antibiotics, whether generic or novel, with the intention of enhancing those antibiotics’ performance and efficacy. We believe this approach will facilitate the capital-efficient development and commercialization of our Potentiator Platform. As part of this strategy, in January 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Everest Medicines to develop, manufacture and commercialize SPR206 in Greater China, South Korea and certain Southeast Asian countries and granted Everest a 12-month exclusive option to negotiate with us for an exclusive license to develop, manufacture or commercialize SPR741 in the same territories.

• | Continue to pursue collaborations with non-commercial organizations for scientific expertise and funding support. We have received funding support from BARDA, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, and the Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator, or CARB-X, a public-private partnership funded by BARDA within the U.S.

• | Expand our portfolio of product candidates for the treatment of MDR infections. Since our inception, we have focused on identifying and developing antibiotics to treat MDR infections, and we are using our expertise to aggressively build and expand a portfolio of product candidates for the treatment of such infections where unmet need exists and no viable generic alternatives are available. Our management team has deep-rooted relationships in the academic, medical and corporate infectious disease community, which provide us visibility into new and innovative therapies under development. Our focus in assessing product candidates relies on three principles: 1) broad spectrum of activity, 2) convenient for patients and 3) novel mechanism to overcome resistance. We believe the greatest unmet medical needs for safe and effective antibiotic treatments lie among infections due to MDR bacteria, as patients with these infections often have limited or inadequate therapeutic options, leading to high rates of mortality. The increasing prevalence of drug resistance and MDR bacteria, and the limitations of existing therapies and traditional drug development approaches, highlight the critical need for novel therapies capable of overcoming resistance, particularly orally administrable agents.

The Problem:  Increasingly Limited Antibiotic Options for Severe Infections
 Antibiotic Background 
 Antibiotics are drugs used to treat infections that are caused by bacteria. Prior to the introduction of the first antibiotics in the 1930s and 1940s, bacterial infections were often fatal. Today, antibiotics are used routinely to treat and prevent infections. There are two main varieties of bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria, which are distinguished by structural differences in their cell envelope. Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a single lipid membrane and a thick cell wall, while Gram-negative bacteria are encircled by two lipid membranes, an inner membrane and an outer membrane, with a thinner cell wall in between, as shown in the illustration below. 
 

Antibiotics that target Gram-negative bacteria must be specifically designed to cross both the inner and outer membranes to enter the bacteria. The outer membrane, with its LPS-containing outer leaflet, represents a significant barrier to the entry into the bacteria by antibiotics and is a significant contributor toward reduced potency of many agents in treating Gram-negative bacterial infections. Recent studies have found that Gram-negative bacteria in certain patient types, such as those with sepsis and Interstitial Lung Disease, are associated with higher mortality and increased intensive care unit, or ICU, admission. Moreover, a study of 13,796 patients in intensive care units around the world reported in 2009 that 51% of patients experienced bacterial infections, and of these patients 62% were infected by Gram-negative organisms.
 Antibiotics are evaluated according to several criteria, including: 
  
• | Spectrum. Antibiotics that are effective against a wide variety of bacteria are considered to be broad-spectrum, while those that act upon only a limited number of bacteria are considered to be narrow-spectrum.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potency. Potency is the measure of the microbiological ability of an antibiotic to kill or inhibit growth of bacteria in vitro. Potency is commonly expressed as the minimum inhibitory concentration, or MIC, in µg/mL, which is the lowest concentration at which the drug inhibits growth of the bacteria. Antibiotics with lower MICs are considered to be more potent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Resistance. Antibiotic resistance refers to the inability of an antibiotic to effectively control bacterial growth. Some bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance can also occur due to genetic mutations or changes in gene expression. There are numerous mechanisms responsible for antibiotic resistance, and resistance mechanisms are often found together and can be transferred between different bacteria, leading to multi-drug resistance.

Growing Antibiotic Resistance in the Hospital and Community Settings 
 Antibiotic resistance is one of the largest threats to global health, and resistance rates are increasing. Antibiotic resistance can affect anyone, of any age and in any country. According to the CDC, each year in the United States at least 2 million hospitalized patients become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and at least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these infections. Approximately 70% of the pathogens that cause these infections are resistant to at least one drug. Likewise, resistance rates are climbing among community-acquired infections as well. According to van Duin and colleagues in 2016: “Some MDR bacteria have become quite prevalent causes of community-acquired infections. The spread of MDR bacteria into the community is a crucial development, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and antibiotic use.” The incidence rate of serious infections is increasing and the proportion of the infections caused by MDR pathogens is increasingly seen as an emerging threat to world health. The CDC estimates that the excess annual cost resulting from these infections in the United States is as high as $20 billion.
 According to the CDC, among all of the bacterial resistance problems, Gram-negative pathogens, which cause a majority of all bacterial infections, are particularly worrisome because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be considered for treatment. In February 2017, the WHO published a list of Gram- negative bacteria based on the urgency of need for new antibiotics and highlighted a critical group of MDR Gram-negative bacteria that pose a particular threat to human health, including Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and multiple Enterobacteriaceae (including Klebsiella sp., E. coli, Serratia and Proteus). These pathogens are associated with significant mortality because the increased incidence of antibiotic resistance has limited the number of effective treatment options.
 There is an acute need for new antibiotics to treat MDR bacterial infections, as few new antibiotics capable of addressing such infections have been approved recently for commercialization or are in clinical development. Further, the majority of MDR bacterial infections historically have been acquired in the hospital setting, where they have been treated using IV-administered antibiotics. However, increasingly such infections are being acquired in the community setting, emphasizing the need for orally administrable antibiotics that can effectively treat such infections.
 Chronic Bacterial Infection without a Viable Cure 
 NTM infections represent a growing global health concern and major unmet medical need because of the lack of new medications being developed to combat these bacteria. NTM infections are ubiquitous environmental pathogens that can cause progressive lung damage and respiratory failure, particularly in patients with compromised immune systems or underlying pulmonary disorders.
 Although rare, the incidence of pulmonary NTM infections is increasing worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 130,000 patients suffer from NTM in the U.S. and Europe, a figure that is growing at a rate of 8% annually. In addition, many patients go undiagnosed and could benefit from treatment with additional testing. The elderly and people with compromised immune or lung function are at greatest risk, as are patients with bronchiectasis for whom it is estimated that up to 50% may also have active NTM lung infection. Treatment of pulmonary NTM infections requires prolonged therapy (continuing for approximately 12 to 24 months) with a combination regimen and is frequently complicated by tolerability and/or toxicity issues. Additionally, there are currently no oral antibiotics specifically approved for use to treat pulmonary NTM infections.
 The most common treatment for NTM infections is combination therapy with drugs traditionally used for tuberculosis (TB) which have limited efficacy and high toxicity. NTM infection is also associated with high healthcare costs and high mortality. In 2014, the annual cost in the United States of treating NTM infections alone was estimated at $1.7 billion.
 Our Solution  
 Antibiotics currently used for first-line empiric treatment of MDR acute bacterial infections and NTM infection suffer from significant limitations. We believe that our product candidates will overcome these limitations, as described below: 

• | SPR994 is designed to address the lack of orally administrable antibiotics to prevent hospitalization and permit IV-to-oral switch therapy in resistant Gram-negative infections. Resistance to most commonly used classes of oral antibiotics, such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, has increased significantly. Many of the most commonly used antibiotics for MDR Gram-negative infections are only available in an IV-administered formulation. Treatment with effective orally administrable antibiotics may prevent hospitalizations for serious infections and enable earlier, more convenient and cost-effective treatment of patients following hospitalization. SPR994 is an orally administrable tablet that we believe has the potential, if approved, to treat such infections in both the community and hospital settings, thereby preventing certain hospitalizations and enabling patients to transition to oral treatment. In the community setting, SPR994, if successfully developed and approved, may allow patients who develop an infection with a resistant pathogen, but are stable enough to be treated in the community, to avoid the need for an IV catheter

and even hospitalization. Hospitalization is a key cost driver for hospital systems and payers, with increasing emphasis being placed on hospital avoidance. In the hospital setting, the lack of effective oral stepdown options results in the potential for lengthy hospital stays or the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter, or PICC, to facilitate outpatient administration of IV antibiotics. SPR994 may enable faster discharges, providing cost-saving advantages for the hospital and mitigating the risk of catheter-related infection for patients.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SPR206 and SPR741 are designed to address the decline of novel and effective IV-administered antibiotics to treat MDR Gram-negative infections in the hospital setting. First-line IV empiric antibiotics, such as levofloxacin, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam, have experienced diminished utility as the number of bacterial strains resistant to these antibiotics in the hospital has increased. Due to gaps in the spectrum of coverage of antibiotics currently on the market, physicians are often confronted with the need to design complicated multi-drug cocktails for patients with serious infections. Based on results from preclinical studies to date, we believe that SPR206 has the potential to address this need as a single agent. We believe that SPR741 has the potential to address the need for more effective treatments against MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections by expanding the spectrum and potency of existing antibiotics, including formerly inactive antibiotics.

• | SPR720 is designed to be the first oral treatment for NTM infection where treatment failure is common and no approved therapies exist. The current treatment for NTM infection is lengthy and involves combination therapy, often including three or more antibiotics, including injectables. None of these combination treatments are currently approved for use in NTM infection. Treatment failure is common and is often due to poor compliance or patients’ inability to tolerate the regimen. Many patients experience progressive lung disease as a result of NTM infection, and mortality rates are high, ranging from 29% to 69% within five years of diagnosis. We believe SPR720, if successfully developed, has the potential to be the first approved oral agent for NTM infection, and it has demonstrated activity in vitro and in vivo against a range of pathogens, including Mycobacterium abscessus, a highly resistant organism causing NTM infection with a high rate of mortality.

Our Product Candidates
 SPR994 (Tebipenem Pivoxil Hydrobromide) 
 Our lead product candidate, SPR994, also called tebipenem pivoxil hydrobromide, is a broad-spectrum oral carbapenem intended for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. We have begun start-up activities for our planned ADAPT-PO pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment. Carbapenems have been utilized for over 30 years and are considered the standard of care for many serious MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections, but to date they have only been available as IV-administered formulations. Currently, there are no commercially available oral carbapenems for use in adults, and we believe SPR994 has the potential to address this unmet need. SPR994 is an oral tablet formulation of tebipenem. Tebipenem was approved in 2009 in Japan for sale under the name Orapenem for pediatric use in common infections. To accelerate our clinical development of SPR994, in June 2017 we signed an exclusive license to certain data and know-how from Meiji and a global pharmaceutical company, to which we refer as Global Pharma, which we intend to use to support our clinical development of SPR994. We have global commercialization rights to SPR994, except in certain contractually specified Asian countries.
 The FDA has designated SPR994 as a QIDP for the treatment of cUTI, CABP and DFI under the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, which enables priority review for regulatory approval by the FDA. If SPR994 is approved for treatment of cUTI, CABP or DFI, the QIDP designation for SPR994 will extend by an additional five years any non-patent exclusivity period awarded for SPR994 in the United States, such as a five-year New Chemical Entity, or NCE, exclusivity granted under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, for a total of 10 years. In Europe, exclusivity for NCEs is 10 years (eight years for data exclusivity and an additional two years for market exclusivity), with the possibility of a one-year extension if the chemical entity is approved for use in an additional indication. Additionally, we believe that our intellectual property portfolio for SPR994, which includes multiple patent applications pending, will provide SPR994 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2039. 
 Advantages of SPR994 
 Key attributes of SPR994 support our confidence in our plan to conduct a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 and in SPR994’s commercial potential, if SPR994 receives regulatory approval. We believe SPR994 has the potential to be a safe and effective treatment for cUTI and other serious and life-threatening infections for which we may develop SPR994.
  
• | Potential to be the first oral carbapenem in adults, if approved. SPR994 is designed to be the first broad-spectrum oral carbapenem-class antibiotic for use in adults to treat MDR Gram-negative infections. Unlike other carbapenems, which are only available as IV-administered infusions, SPR994 is an orally administered tablet. Oral administration

may potentially allow physicians to avoid IV-administered antibiotics for otherwise healthy or stable patients and/or allow for a reduction in costs associated with avoiding or shortening hospitalization.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential differentiated launch characteristics. There are limited branded or generic oral options currently approved or available to treat fluoroquinilone- and cephalosporin-resistant pathogens to assist with transitioning patients from the hospital to the community setting, or to prevent unnecessary hospitalization for cUTI. We believe SPR994, if approved, to be primarily reimbursable outside the hospital diagnosis-related group, or DRG, system, because of the limited number of doses required in the hospital setting. Together, we believe these factors could differentiate SPR994 from other recently launched antibiotic drugs, many of which are injectable, reimbursed within the hospital DRG system, and/or substitutable with equally effective generic alternatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Single Phase 3 trial design supported by extensive clinical and preclinical studies. Spero’s clinical and preclinical studies with SPR994 suggest that the safety, antimicrobial potency, and pharmacodynamics exposure profile observed to date are comparable to IV carbapenems. Data from our Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR994 studying a dosage of 600 mg three times per day (TID) have suggested a tolerability profile and pharmacodynamic activity in plasma and urine for SPR994 that are comparable to available data for IV-administered ertapenem given once daily. Data from Meiji’s Phase 2 dose ranging study of tebipenem pivoxil in cUTI show microbiological eradication at test of cure comparable to other IV agents for cUTI. Also, the in vitro potency of SPR994 against Enterobacteriaceae was observed to be similar to IV-administered ertapenem and imipenem in preclinical studies. As a result of this extensive existing data, we believe that SPR994 has the potential to be used for the treatment of cUTI and other serious and life-threatening infections caused by resistant Gram-negative pathogens. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable safety, efficacy and tolerability profile suggested by clinical trials of tebipenem in Japanese populations. A granule formulation of tebipenem has been approved for use in Japan in pediatric patients since 2009, where it has demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile. Approximately 1,200 subjects have been dosed with the active pharmaceutical ingredient of SPR994, tebipenem, in clinical and pharmacologic studies during development of this drug by Meiji and its partner in Japan. This data set includes 741 adults, including 88 patients with cUTIs, the initial indication for which we are developing SPR994. In each case tebipenem has demonstrated a favorable safety, pharmacokinetic and tolerability profile. In addition, Meiji has conducted a 3,540 patient post-marketing study supporting the safety and tolerability profile of tebipenem, specifically demonstrating a safety profile that aligns well with that observed across the clinical trial program and tolerability in line with other broad spectrum oral antibiotics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential to enable IV-to-oral transition of antibiotic treatment to assist with reduction in hospital stays and/or eliminate the need for hospitalization. We believe the unique oral formulation of SPR994 may enable patients who begin IV-administered treatment for ESBLs in the hospital setting to transition to oral dosing of SPR994 either in the hospital or upon discharge for convenient home-based care. We believe that the availability and use of an oral carbapenem as a transition therapy may eliminate hospitalization or reduce the length of a patient’s hospital stay and the overall cost of care.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the foregoing advantages of SPR994 also significantly differentiate SPR994 from fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones are the most widely used antibiotic class in treating community and hospital Gram-negative infections, but they have encountered increasing resistance among MDR Gram-negative bacteria and are associated with significant adverse effects. The table below reflects resistance rates in the United States in the community and hospital settings.
 
 
cUTIs in the United States | 2013-2014 E. coli Resistance Rates to Fluoroquinolones | 2000-2004 E. coli ResistanceRates to Fluoroquinolones
Community Setting | 11.7% | 0% 
Hospital Setting | 34.5% | 3.5% 

 
Currently, fluoroquinolones are the most frequently selected antibiotic for empirical urinary tract infection, or UTI, treatment in the community and hospital settings. Current UTI treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America identify fluoroquinolones as an appropriate empirical therapy option. This recommendation, however, is contingent on local resistance rates being less than 10%. The endemicity (high rates) of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli found in the United States today in the community and hospital settings based on the table above would suggest that fluoroquinolones should not be used empirically for cUTI patients.
 10


The following table highlights the observed in vitro potency differences between SPR994 and levofloxacin, the most widely used fluoroquinolone. As shown below, SPR994 has a MIC90 value of 0.03 µg/ mL, which compares favorably (i.e., at or below) to the potency value obtained by levofloxacin. 
 
 
Compound | E. coli MIC90 (µg /mL)
SPR994 | 0.03 
Levofloxacin | >4 

 
In addition, the FDA has issued several warnings against the use of fluoroquinolones in certain patients. In particular, an FDA Advisory Committee stated in November 2015 that the risk of serious side effects caused by fluoroquinolones generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated UTIs. The FDA has determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with these conditions who have no alternative treatment options. We believe SPR994 could become a potential alternative to oral fluoroquinolones based on its safety and efficacy profile.
 Significant Market Opportunity for SPR994 
 Given the observed activity of SPR994 against different bacteria, we view the market opportunity for SPR994, if approved, to be substantial, including for the following uses: 
  
• | Community setting: Treating urinary tract infections acquired in the community setting without the need for patient hospitalization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Hospital setting: Transitioning patients hospitalized for UTIs to an appropriate oral therapy as they are discharged from the hospital.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 UTIs are among the most common bacterial diseases worldwide, with significant clinical and economic burden. IQVIA (formerly QuintilesIMS) estimates that between 33 and 34 million patients either visit their physician or are hospitalized for a UTI or otherwise suspected of experiencing a UTI in the United States annually. While drugs such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim/Septra) and fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin) have been the primary oral options for treatment of UTIs caused by Gram-negative organisms, nearly 30% to 35% of UTIs are resistant, which has led to increased use of IV-administered therapeutics such as carbapenems. 
 IQVIA completed a market assessment in August 2017 in the community and hospital settings in which it estimated that there were 11 to 12 million patients annually who presented in the community physician’s office with a UTI and 3.5 to 4.5 million patients annually in the hospital with a UTI in the United States alone. Of these UTIs, 10 to 11 million are suspected to be caused by Gram-negative bacteria, and 4 to 5 million of these patients had an infection that is resistant to or failed first-line therapy, such as the fluoroquinolone class, or require IV therapy due to the severity of infection. Physicians in the survey reported high concern with growing fluoroquinolone resistance and lack of oral options for MDR Gram-negative infections. We believe SPR994 is well positioned to meet the unmet need for an oral therapy for community-acquired UTI and may offer physicians an option for treating MDR UTIs while avoiding patient hospitalization. In addition, we believe SPR994 has the potential to accelerate hospital discharge and obviate the need for continued IV-administered therapy at home by transitioning discharged patients to an at-home oral therapy. Our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for SPR994 will focus on patients who suffer from a subset of UTIs called cUTIs, which affect approximately 4.9 million patients in the United States annually. A significant majority of UTIs, including cUTIs, are caused by a group of MDR Gram-negative bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae. 
 SPR994 Clinical Development Program 
 Planned Single Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial (ADAPT-PO)
 We initiated a Phase 1 dose-selection clinical trial of SPR994 in healthy volunteers in Australia in October 2017. In September 2018, we announced positive results from the final analysis of this study and identified a dose of 600 mg TID for our planned single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI. Based on our pre-IND, pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA, we believe that positive results from a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 in cUTI demonstrating a 10% non-inferiority margin would support the approval of SPR994 for the treatment of cUTI. As a result of the meeting, we submitted an IND application for SPR994 in cUTI with the FDA and received FDA acceptance of the IND application in February 2019. We have begun start-up activities for the ADAPT-PO clinical trial and anticipate opening trial sites around the end of March 2019 to support study enrollment. Following receipt of top-line data from our ADAPT-PO Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994, if favorable, together with requisite safety data, drug-drug interaction

studies and other studies, we intend to submit to the FDA an NDA for SPR994 to treat cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis. These data, if positive, may also support marketing applications in other global regions.
 QIDP Designation
 The FDA has designated SPR994 as a QIDP for the treatment of cUTI, CABP and DFI under the GAIN Act, which enables priority review for regulatory approval by the FDA. The QIDP designation for SPR994, however, does not guarantee a faster development process or ensure FDA approval. Further, if SPR994 is successfully developed and approved for the treatment of cUTI, CABP or DFI, the FDA’s QIDP designation for SPR994 should extend any non-patent exclusivity period awarded to SPR994 in the United States for five years, such as a five-year New Chemical Entity data exclusivity granted under the Hatch-Waxman Act.
 Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results
 Our completed Phase 1 SAD and MAD clinical trial of SPR994 assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of orally administered SPR994. The Phase 1 clinical trial enrolled 124 healthy adult volunteers into 14 SAD cohorts with SPR994 given orally as single doses ranging from 100 mg to 900 mg daily and two MAD cohorts with SPR994 given orally at doses of 300 mg and 600 mg every 8 hours (TID administration) for 14 days. Repeated dose administration of both 300 mg and 600 mg of SPR994 TID was well tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with the carbapenem class of antibiotics. Final results demonstrated a linear and proportional increase in plasma exposure over the dose range tested, with no accumulation over 14 days of repeated dosing. Furthermore, the administration of SPR994 in the fed or fasting state did not substantially alter the plasma drug exposure, indicating that SPR994 can likely be administered without regard to meals. Consistent with the predominantly renal elimination of SPR994, peak urine concentrations were approximately 50 to 100-fold higher than maximum concentrations in plasma, as shown in the charts below, supporting SPR994’s potential utility as a treatment for patients with cUTI.
Free Plasma Concentrations of SPR994

Urine Concentration of SPR994 after a Single Dose
 

The single planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994, ADAPT-PO, is designed as a double-blind, double-dummy trial to compare oral SPR994 with an existing standard of care IV antibiotic, ertapenem, in approximately 1,200 patients randomized 1:1 in each arm. The primary endpoint of the pivotal trial will be the combined clinical and microbiological response at the test of cure with a 10% non-inferiority margin versus IV ertapenem. The trial will also incorporate a lead-in cohort of 70 patients with intensive pharmacokinetics assessment to confirm the dose and exposure in the cUTI patient population and we anticipate receiving interim pharmacokinetic and safety data from this lead-in cohort in the second half of 2019. We also plan to conduct routine ancillary clinical pharmacology studies in parallel with the Phase 3 trial as required by the FDA for the approval of SPR994, including a renal insufficiency study, a thorough QT prolongation study and a drug-drug interaction study.
In vitro Activity Against MDR Enterobacteriaceae
 SPR994 has shown activity in preclinical in vitro studies against a wide variety of ESBL-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains. We believe these data show the ability of orally available SPR994 to deliver similar activity to comparative IV-administered agents. 
 Approximately 1,200 subjects have been dosed with tebipenem pivoxil in clinical and pharmacologic studies during the development of this drug by Meiji in Japan. The data set from these studies includes 741 adults, including 88 patients with cUTIs, the initial indication for which we plan to develop SPR994. In addition, there are post-marketing outcomes data reporting the safety and efficacy of tebipenem in 3,540 pediatric patients with pneumonia, otitis media, or sinusitis. These data are consistent with the safety profile of tebipenem as established in the clinical trial. We have also tested SPR994 in vitro and in animal models. We believe that nonclinical assays are generally predictive of clinical efficacy for antibiotics, particularly in the case of a well-understood class such as carbapenems.
Meiji Phase 2 Clinical Trial Data of Tebipenem in cUTI 
 Meiji and its partner conducted two exploratory, dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trials of tebipenem in patients with cUTI including patients with acute pyelonephritis. These trials were conducted in Japan between 2001 and 2004. Study L-084 04 (report date 2003), a multicenter open-label study to evaluate the efficacy (clinical and microbiological) and safety (adverse events and laboratory tests) of tebipenem pivoxil at doses of 100 mg administered TID (Group A), 150 mg administered BID (Group B), and 150 mg administered TID (Group C), for seven days in patients with cUTI. There were 51 adult patients, aged 20-74 years inclusive, enrolled with 40 being evaluable for efficacy (14 in Group A; 17 in Group B; 9 in Group C). Study ME1211 (report date 2004), a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate efficacy (early and late assessments) and safety (adverse events and laboratory tests) of tebipenem pivoxil at doses of 250 mg administered BID (500 mg Group) and 300 mg administered TID (900 mg Group) for seven days in patients with UTI. There were 37 adult patients, aged 20 to 74 years inclusive, enrolled with all being evaluable for efficacy (19 in 500-mg Group; 18 in 900-mg Group). In these studies, dosing three times per day showed the greatest effect as compared with other dosing regimens, consistent with the interim results from our Phase 1 clinical trial.
 Although the design of the Phase 2 clinical trials in Japan was different from what is recommended in FDA guidance for clinical trials in patients with cUTI, including acute pyelonephritis, we believe these results provide support for our planned single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of SPR994 at a dose of 600 mg TID for the treatment of cUTI. With respect to these results, which are summarized in the chart below, the efficacy rate refers to the proportion of subjects judged to have experienced a “markedly effective” or “effective” tebipenem dosage versus the total number of subjects tested, and the negative conversion rate refers to the proportion of subjects with negative urine cultures versus the total number of subjects tested.

 In these two Phase 2 cUTI trials, 83-84% of patients had complicated lower tract UTIs (complicated cystitis). Taken together, the Meiji Phase 2 trials assessed the clinical and microbiological response to doses of tebipenem pivoxil ranging from 300 mg to 900 mg per day administered as two (BID) or three (TID) split doses. Clinical and microbiological responses at end of therapy, or EOT, were high for all regimens tested; however, the microbiological eradication rates at test of cure, or TOC, were highest in patients receiving tebipenem 150 mg or 300 mg TID. Of note, the microbiological eradication rates at the TOC in these dosing groups was similar to that reported for the subsets of patients with complicated cystitis in recent cUTI clinical trials utilizing intravenously administered antibiotics. Of note, the AUC exposure observed with 600 mg oral TID of SPR994 in the Spero single- and multiple-ascending dose study was comparable to that demonstrated to be effective in the Meiji cUTI trials. The appropriateness of the proposed therapeutic dose of SPR994 is supported by a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis based on three preclinical pharmacodynamic models (murine neutropenic thigh, hollow fiber, and one compartment pharmacodynamic model) and a clinical population pharmacokinetic model, which indicates that 600 mg of SPR994 administered TID is likely to achieve high target attainment over the MIC range of the most prevalent Enterobacteriaceae causing cUTI.  
 Japanese Data Supporting Safety of Tebipenem
 Tebipenem pivoxil is a prodrug that is metabolized to tebipenem, its therapeutically active form. We view the clinical safety profile of tebipenem pivoxil established by Meiji as relevant and supportive of SPR994 because both metabolize to the active metabolite, tebipenem, in plasma. Our formulation development efforts are designed to improve target concentration while maintaining the exposure per dose.
 Tebipenem pivoxil is an orally administered carbapenem, which is a sub-group of the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. The safety of tebipenem pivoxil was evaluated in approximately 1,200 subjects supporting the application for approval in Japan. In this safety data set, there are 741 adult subjects across 17 trials and 440 pediatric subjects across six trials. These 23 trials in total, included one double-blind, comparator-controlled trial in children, five open-label trials in children, five trials enrolling adult patients (including 
 14


two open-label cUTI trials), and 12 Phase 1 clinical pharmacology trials. Among the pharmacology trials, tebipenem pivoxil was studied for an effect on QT interval, and for the known effect of the pivoxil prodrug on plasma carnitine concentrations.
 In these studies, tebipenem pivoxil was generally well tolerated, with an adverse event, or AE, profile comparable to common, approved oral beta lactam antibiotics and IV-administered carbapenems. The most common AEs were gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhea, loose stools) in both children and adults, and in the Phase 3 clinical trial of otitis media, the incidence was similar to that reported for the comparator, cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. No effect of the administration of tebipenem pivoxil on the prolongation of the QT interval was observed, and the effect on plasma carnitine concentrations was reversed post treatment and not associated with AEs. A side effect seen with beta-lactam antibiotics is seizures; however, there have been no reports of inducement of seizures due to the administration of tebipenem pivoxil in clinical trials.
 Meiji has reported post-marketing outcomes data reporting the safety and efficacy of Orapenem Fine Granules 10% for Pediatric Use (tebipenem pivoxil) in pediatric patients with pneumonia, otitis media, or sinusitis. A total of 3,547 cases were enrolled into the observational study, and the analysis was conducted using 3,540 cases for which it was possible to recover the questionnaires.
 A total of 348 instances of adverse drug reactions were observed in 334 cases amongst the 3,337 cases (including 6 adult cases) used in the safety analyses, and the incidence of adverse drug reactions was 10.01% (334 cases/3,337 cases). The adverse drug reaction that occurred most frequently was “diarrhea” (9.5%, 318 instances/3,337 cases). One serious drug reaction was observed of “multi-organ failure”. These data are consistent with the safety profile of tebipenem as established in the pediatric clinical trials and reflected in the Orapenem product labeling in Japan.
 A clinical trial evaluating the effect of tebipenem pivoxil dosing over one week on intestinal flora was also performed. Total aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts were evaluated. Total bacterial count was reduced by day 7 of the study in both the 100 and 200 mg TID groups. However, no additional change in bacterial count was observed on subsequent examination days. Neither fecal C. difficile nor its toxin was detected in any of the subjects during or following completion of the 7-day dosing period.
 Funded Label Expansion Opportunity
 In addition to cUTI, we believe that SPR994 has the potential to treat other serious and life-threatening infections, including CAP. Our BARDA award provides funding for Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials supporting a potential CAP indication for SPR994. 
 Our IV Potentiator Platform (SPR206 and SPR741) 
 We have two product candidates in our IV Potentiator Platform, SPR206 and SPR741, to treat Gram-negative infections in the hospital setting. Both have exhibited in vitro and in vivo activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including organisms identified by the CDC and the WHO as urgent and serious threats to human health. SPR206 has demonstrated antibacterial activity as a single agent and the ability to enhance the potency and spectrum of partner antibiotics. SPR206 demonstrates broad-spectrum MDR Gram-negative activity, including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. SPR741 has minimal observed antibacterial activity as a single agent and requires co-administration of a companion antibiotic to exert antimicrobial activity. SPR741 has demonstrated activity against MDR Gram-negative organisms, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii depending on the combination partner. 
 In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR206, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects, and expect top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019. Data from IND-enabling studies, together with data presented at the ESCMID/ASM Conference in September 2018, collectively demonstrate SPR206’s favorable safety profile and in vitro activity against MDR Gram-negative pathogens. 
 We have completed a Phase 1, two-part, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation trial of SPR741. The safety and pharmacokinetics data from this study were reported at the 2018 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, or ECCMID, congress in Madrid, Spain. The data indicated that SPR741 was generally well tolerated at single doses up to and including 800 mg and at doses up to and including 600 mg every 8 hours for 14 days.
 We have also completed a Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom. The Phase 1b trial enrolled 27 healthy volunteers to evaluate SPR741 as a single dose in combination with compounds from the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, including cephalosporins (ceftazidime), monobactams (aztreonam) and beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (piperacillin/tazobactam). The trial was designed to assess the impact, if any, on the standalone safety and pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the standalone safety and pharmacokinetics of the beta-lactam combination drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose. In this study, we observed no impact on the safety or pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the beta-lactam drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose, supporting further development of SPR741 as a combination agent for the treatment of MDR infections.

We have multiple patent applications pending for SPR206 that we believe will provide SPR206 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2039. Additionally, we believe that our intellectual property portfolio for SPR741, which includes multiple issued patents and patent applications pending, will provide SPR741 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2039.
 Advantages of our Potentiator Platform 
 We believe that the following key attributes of our Potentiator Platform generally have the potential to support the clinical utility and commercial value of our Potentiator Platform for the safe and effective treatment of serious Gram-negative infections: 
  
• | Potential to Expand the Potency of Standard-of-Care Antibiotics. We believe SPR206 and SPR741 and have the potential to expand the potency of standard-of-care antibiotics by restoring and expanding their Gram-negative activity, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes, decreasing physicians’ reliance on drugs of last resort and encouraging improved antibiotic stewardship.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SPR741 was generally safe and well tolerated in Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies. Data from our Phase 1 SAD and MAD clinical trial of SPR741 demonstrate SPR741 was generally safe and well tolerated at single doses up to and including 800 mg and at doses up to and including 600 mg every 8 hours for 14 days, as well as in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SPR206 may be a safe and potent IV-administered direct-acting agent. Like SPR741, our Potentiator Platform candidate SPR206 is designed to interact with LPS to disrupt the outer membrane. However, SPR206 is also designed to have direct antibiotic activity, while retaining Potentiator activity, including activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Data from SPR206 in vitro and in vivo GLP safety pharmacology and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, or ADME, studies and 14-day, two-species GLP toxicology studies provide support for an acceptable safety profile, which led to SPR206’s designation as a clinical candidate and the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in December 2018. We are developing SPR206 as a treatment for high-risk patients with suspected or known Gram-negative infections such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, or CRAB, and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or MDR PA, to prevent mortality and reduce the length of stay in the hospital setting.

 Significant Market Opportunity for SPR206 and SPR741, including Gram-Negative IV Market 
 The need for new antibiotics to treat CRE, CRAB and MDR PA is particularly acute, as together these represent among the top global threats in infectious disease and can cause severe and often deadly infections. As such, there is an acute need for new drugs to treat MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections. Currently approved products are increasingly ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria due to increasing resistance, resulting in limited treatment options for patients with MDR infections. Few new therapeutic agents have been approved or are in clinical development to treat infections caused by MDR Gram-negative bacteria.
 Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen primarily associated with hospital-acquired infections with between 50,000 to 80,000 infections recorded annually in the United States and with approximately 63% of isolates exhibiting multi-drug resistance. Mortality rates for patients with Acinetobacter baumannii have been reported as high as 43%. Currently the only drugs to treat these resistant organisms are polymyxins such as colistin, polymixyn B (PMB) and tigecycline (TIG), both of which have significant and dose limiting safety and tolerability issues. SPR206 would provide a much-needed alternative for the treatment of these very serious infections.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common Gram-negative organisms in the hospital setting. Incidence ranges from 13% in UTIs to as high as 25% in respiratory tract infections. Resistance to commonly used agents such as cephalosporins, piperacillin/tazobactam and quinolones ranges from 10% in the non-ICU setting to upwards of 35% in the ICU. In preclinical studies to date, SPR206 has demonstrated potent activity across a broad range of resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are limited treatment options available today to treat these resistant organisms. 
 SPR206—Development Plan 
 Non-Clinical Data Supports the Progression of SPR206 to Clinical Development 
 SPR206 was assessed in a suite of non-clinical, IND-enabling studies, including 14-day, two species, GLP toxicology experiments and in vitro and in vivo GLP safety pharmacology and ADME studies. The data suggest the potential for an acceptable safety profile and add context to earlier microbiological and in vivo efficacy testing of SPR206 that demonstrated potent activity as a single agent against MDR and XDR bacterial strains, including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae. The composite data suggest SPR206 has the potential for wide therapeutic margins in the setting of serious hospital Gram-negative infections.

In Vitro Activity of SPR206 Against MDR Gram-Negative Bacteria 
 Results from multiple susceptibility testing studies against MDR Enterobacteriaceae suggests that SPR206 is capable potent activity against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
 


In vivo Activity of SPR206 against Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
The activity of SPR206 against a carbapenem resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii exceeded the activity of polymyxin B (PMB) and tigecycline (TIG) in a mouse lung infection model as shown below. 
 Activity of SPR206 vs. Comparators in a Mouse Lung Infection Model 
 
Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 trial of SPR206, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects. We anticipate receiving top-line data from the trial in the second half of 2019.
SPR741—Phase 1 Clinical Trial and Clinical Development 
 Data from our Phase 1 SAD and MAD clinical trial show SPR741 administered intravenously in single doses up to and including 800 mg and multiple daily doses up to and including 600 mg every 8 hours for 14 days was generally well tolerated in healthy adult subjects. There were no deaths or serious adverse events. All subjects completed the study.
 We initiated our Phase 1b drug-drug interaction clinical trial of SPR741 in the United Kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Phase 1b trial enrolled 27 healthy volunteers to evaluate SPR741 as a single dose in combination with compounds from the beta-lactam class of antibiotics, including cephalosporins (ceftazidime), monobactams (aztreonam) and beta-lactams/beta-lactamase 
 17


inhibitors (piperacillin/tazobactam). The trial was designed to assess the impact, if any, on the standalone pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the standalone pharmacokinetics of the beta-lactam combination drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose. In this study, we observed no impact on the tolerability or standalone pharmacokinetics of SPR741 or the beta-lactam drug when the two are dosed together as a single dose, supporting further development of SPR741 as a combination agent for the treatment of MDR infections.
 Our Potentiator Platform product candidates (SPR206 and SPR741) are being funded in part with non-dilutive funding from the DoD, CARB-X and NIAID, consisting of $8.6 million through December 31, 2018. We have global commercialization rights to SPR741, which has global patent protection extending through 2038.
 In Vitro Activity of SPR741 Against MDR Gram-Negative Bacteria 
 Results from multiple susceptibility testing studies against suggest that SPR741 is capable of potentiating the activity of several classes of antibiotics, including some beta-lactams and macrolides. We ascertained the potential clinical profile of combinations of SPR741 against MDR Enterobacteriaceae encountered in the hospital setting by testing the combinations against a large number of clinical isolates collected from unique patients with different types of infections from hospitals around the world. In one such study, we measured the ability of SPR741 to enhance the activity of ceftazidime, or CAZ, or piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn, or TZP) against a large collection of clinical isolates expressing the drug-resistant phenotype ESBL. In each case, SPR741 potentiated the activity of the antibiotics resulting in an MIC90 shift from 256 to 8 for CAZ and from 256 to 1 for TZP. We believe that these data demonstrate SPR741’s ability to restore the combined antibiotic’s therapeutic activity against a resistant strain of bacteria.
SPR720 Pulmonary Non-Tuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) Infection Program
 A third area of our focus is orphan infectious diseases, specifically non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. We are developing SPR720, a therapeutic candidate with a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of NTM infection. SPR720 is designed to be the first novel, oral candidate to treat pulmonary NTM infection. SPR720 represents a novel class of antibacterial agents that target enzymes essential for bacterial DNA replication. 
 SPR720 has several key attributes including:
  
• | Broad spectrum of activity. SPR720 has demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against the most common organisms causing NTM infections, including Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium abscessus.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convenient for patients. SPR720 is an oral antibiotic. Many patients can find inhalers difficult to use and poor inhalation technique can negatively impact drug delivery and response to therapy. Oral therapy is simple and more convenient.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Novel mechanism. SPR720 employs a novel mechanism. Recent studies have shown the high prevalence of drug resistance in NTM infection species that threatens adequate control of the disease. Novel mechanisms may help evade existing modes of resistance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SPR720 has shown potent activity against most common NTM infection species, such as M. avium, M. abscessus and M. kansasii. As shown in the exhibit below, SPR720 showed dose responsive activity against difficult to treat MDR pathogens, with better activity as compared to amikacin (AMK) considered one of the positive controls in this experiment.
 


Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are typically found in water and soil. NTM infections cause a rare infection of the lung that is acquired through inhalation of this microbe. There are approximately 150 types of mycobacteria, with MAC and Mycobacterium abscessus the most common cause of NTM infections, together comprising almost 90% of all NTM infections.  
 NTM infections occur in many different types of patients. NTM infections often occur in people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV, or those with respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or bronchiectasis. According to Strollo et al. and Adjemian et al., the diagnosed patient population is approximately 86,000 in the United States. The annual prevalence of NTM infection is increasing at an estimated rate of 8% per year. While people of any age can be infected by NTM, it mostly affects middle-aged to elderly adults, and is increasing among patients over 65, a population expected to nearly double by 2030. While relatively rare compared to other infectious diseases, the prevalence of NTM infection has more than doubled since 1997 and unfortunately, NTM infections are often undiagnosed, masquerading as another respiratory condition such as COPD or asthma. By comparison, the prevalence of tuberculosis in North America has declined.
 There are currently no oral FDA-approved therapeutics specifically approved for use to treat pulmonary NTM infections. Given the unmet medical need, there are regulatory incentives available to encourage drug development to address NTM infection. These include orphan drug designation, potential for breakthrough therapy status and QIDP designation. Treatment of pulmonary NTM infections requires prolonged therapy (continuing for approximately 12 to 24 months) with a combination regimen and is frequently complicated by tolerability and/or toxicity issues. Treatment failure is common and is often due to poor compliance or inability to tolerate the regimen. Many patients experience progressive lung disease and mortality is high. We believe there is a need for new, potent, orally available therapies for NTM infection. While there are competitive compounds in late-stage development for NTM infection, these therapies are not effective in all patients and are not orally available.
 We believe that our intellectual property portfolio for SPR720, which includes multiple issued patents and patent applications pending, will provide SPR720 protection globally, including in the United States and Europe, through 2033.
 Our SPR720 Development Plan 
 Our strategy is to develop SPR720 to become the first oral treatment FDA-indicated for NTM infection, and to enable refractory patients to regain a better quality of life. SPR720 is currently in clinical development. We assessed SPR720 in a series of non-clinical studies, including IND-enabling 28- and 31-day GLP toxicity studies in non-human primates and rats, respectively, and safety pharmacology studies. In vitro MIC studies demonstrated potent activity for SPR720 against prevalent NTM pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus. Furthermore, in vivo studies in murine models of pneumonia demonstrated favorable efficacy relative to standard-of-care comparator agents. The data suggest that SPR720 has an acceptable safety profile, encouraging target pathogen efficacy, and a wide therapeutic margin. These results, in conjunction with the recent regulatory interactions Spero has had, support the further development of SPR720. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720 in January 2019, designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose, multi-cohort study in healthy subjects, and expect top-line data from this trial in the second half of 2019.

We also amended and restated the 2015 Northern 
 20


License Agreement, which, as amended, we refer to as the 2017 Northern License Agreement, to include certain contingent cash payments as described below. The 2017 Northern License Agreement has a perpetual term and no express termination rights. 
 Under the 2017 Northern License Agreement, Northern granted to Spero Potentiator an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to develop and commercialize certain licensed compounds under certain Northern patents, patent applications and know-how in consideration for one or more near-term milestone payments up to an aggregate of $2.5 million based on either clinical milestones or the completion of our IPO, which event occurred and which amount was paid in November 2017, and in consideration for up to an aggregate of $4.5 million upon receipt of marketing approval of SPR741 or other compounds licensed from Northern which, in either case, is approved to be co-administered with a different antibiotic agent. With Northern, we have established a joint development committee for the exchange of information and ideas regarding development of the licensed compounds, to monitor conduct of activities and to provide and receive updates regarding new inventions. In addition, we provide periodic reports to Northern describing the development and commercialization of the licensed compounds, including SPR741. 
 Cantab Agreements 
 In June 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement, or the Cantab Agreement, with Pro Bono Bio PLC, a corporation organized under the laws of England, and its affiliates, including PBB Distributions Limited, or PBB, Cantab Anti-Infectives Ltd., or CAI and New Pharma License Holdings Limited, or NPLH, in order to acquire NPLH and its intellectual property rights and assets relating to our Potentiator Platform, and our next-generation potentiating agents in particular. The intellectual property portfolio we acquired includes patents which cover SPR206 as well as other novel potentiating agents, polymyxin derivatives and other LPS or outer-membrane bacterial disrupting agents. In exchange for the acquisition of NPLH, we paid PBB upfront consideration in the amount of $0.3 million and also agreed to make milestone payments of up to $5.8 million upon the achievement of specified clinical and regulatory milestones and  a payment of £5.0 million ($6.4 million as of December 31, 2018) upon the achievement of a specified commercial milestone. We also agreed to pay royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products licensed under the agreement. In addition, Spero Cantab issued an equity interest in Spero Cantab and entered into a subscription agreement and shareholders agreement with PBB. In July 2017, we repurchased PBB’s minority equity interest in Spero Cantab in exchange for a one-time nonrefundable upfront fee of approximately $0.2 million and we also amended the Cantab Agreement to increase the contingent milestone payments to PBB by an aggregate of $0.1 million. The Cantab Agreement continues indefinitely, with royalty payment obligations thereunder continuing on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country or the expiration in such country of the last to expire valid claim of any of the applicable patents. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $0.2 million in expense related to the achievement of regulatory milestones for SPR206.

The Everest License Agreement may be terminated in its entirety by Everest upon 90 or 180 days’ prior written notice, depending on the stage of development of the initial Licensed Product.
 Government Awards 
 As described below, through December 31, 2018, we have committed funding support of up to an aggregate of $25.2 million in non- dilutive funding from BARDA, NIAID, the DoD and CARB-X, with the potential to receive a total of up to $54.3 million (inclusive of amounts we have already received) if certain options are exercised. These awards are structured in the following manner:

• | BARDA award to support the further clinical development of SPR994. BARDA is providing initial funding of $15.7 million, with the potential for up to an additional $28.5 million over 5 years. The BARDA award commits funding of $15.7 million over a three-year base period from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021. The balance of the award is subject to BARDA exercising two options. As part of our SPR994 collaboration with BARDA described above, there will be studies assessing the efficacy of SPR994 in treatment of infections caused by biodefense threats such as anthrax, plague, and melioidosis, including a possible clinical trial in pneumonia patients. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or DTRA, will provide up to $10.0 million in addition to the total potential $44.2 million from BARDA, to cover the cost of the nonclinical biodefense aspects of the collaboration program. While such funding would be for the purpose of developing SPR994 in these areas, we will not receive any funds from DTRA. Upon these achievements, BARDA may exercise its second option to fund a bronchoalveolar lavage study to demonstrate safety and lung exposure sufficient to support efficacy and a clinical trial in pneumonia patients to demonstrate safety and data suggestive of efficacy.

• | Our Potentiator Platform program funding from DoD and CARB-X. The DoD funding supports next- generation Potentiator Platform discovery and screening of SPR741 partner antibiotics and SPR206. Our DoD cooperative agreement is structured as a single, two-year $1.5 million award. We are eligible for the full funding from the DoD and there are no options to be exercised at a later date. The CARB-X award supported screening and selection of SPR741 partner antibiotics (with the exception of azithromycin) with the goal of taking one SPR741/partner combination through IND-enabling studies, culminating in the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial. The CARB-X award was structured as a base period followed by two sequential options. In March 2017, CARB-X committed funds of $1.5 million to support SPR741 development efforts for the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. In March 2018, CARB-X committed an additional $0.4 million related to the first option for a period from December 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018. There will be no additional options exercised under the CARB-X award.

Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
 Spero-Owned Intellectual Property Relating to SPR994 and Other Compounds Under Development 
 We have patent applications directed to the composition of matter, formulation and/or use of SPR994, SPR741, SPR206 and SPR720 pending in the United States, Europe, Japan and other countries.

Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. 
 23


NTM Infection Program (SPR720) 
 Our intellectual property portfolio for our DNA Gyrase Inhibitor program includes issued patents and pending patent applications directed to composition of matter for SPR720, and its close analogs and prodrugs, novel solid forms of SPR720 and its prodrugs, methods of manufacture, and methods of treatment using SPR720 alone and in combination with other antibiotic compounds. All patents and patent applications in the portfolio are wholly owned by us. As of December 31, 2018, we owned eleven issued U.S. patents, 74 issued foreign patents, and 13 pending foreign patent applications. The issued and foreign patents are in a number of jurisdictions including the European Union and its member states, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and Taiwan. Issued U.S. and foreign patents, and patents issuing from pending U.S. and foreign applications will have statutory expiration dates of January 2032, June 2032 and July 2033. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. 
Patent Term and Patent Term Extensions 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date set for the patent. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to each regulatory review period may be granted an extension and only those claims reading on the approved drug are extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. 
Trade Secrets 
 We rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our unpatented technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach and could lose our trade secrets through such a breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. 
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial, technical human resources than we do, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our potential competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining FDA approval drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete.
 We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of most advanced product candidate, SPR994, if approved, will be efficacy, coverage of drug-resistant strains bacteria, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of oral dosing, price, availability of reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payers and susceptibility to drug resistance.
 We are developing SPR994 as an oral antibiotic for use as a monotherapy for the treatment of resistant and MDR infections. If approved, SPR994 would compete with several antibiotics currently in clinical development, including ceftibuten/clavulanate (“C-Scape”) from Achaogen, Inc., sulopenem from Iterum Therapeutics Limited, and omadacycline from Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We also expect that SPR994, if approved, would compete with future and current generic versions of marketed antibiotics. If approved, we believe that SPR994 would compete effectively against these compounds on the basis of SPR994’s potential:
 24


 
• | broad range of activity against a wide variety of resistant and MDR Gram-negative bacteria;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | low probability of drug resistance;
--+------------------------------------


• | a favorable safety and tolerability profile supported by years of post-marketing experience in Japan;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a convenient oral dosing regimen and opportunity to step-down from IV-administered therapy; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | as a monotherapy treatment for MDR Gram-negative infections.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 We are also developing our Potentiator Platform, SPR206 and SPR741, as IV-administered agents for Gram-negative infections in the hospital. If approved, SPR741 or our single-agent candidate SPR206 would compete with several IV-administered product candidates marketed for the treatment of Gram-negative infections, including ceftazidime-avibactam (“Avycaz”) from Allergan plc and Pfizer Inc., ceftolozane-tazobactam (“Zerbaxa”) from Merck & Co., plazomicin (“Zemdri”) from Achaogen, Inc., eravacycline (“Xerava”) from Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and meropenem-vaborbactam (“Vabomere”) from Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. There are also a number of IV-administered product candidates in late-stage clinical development that are intended to treat resistant Gram-negative infections, including cefiderocol from Shionogi & Co. Ltd., and imipenem-relebactam from Merck & Co. Each of these products and product candidates employs a mechanism of action that differs from the mechanism of action employed by SPR741.
 We are developing SPR720 to be the first approved oral treatment for NTM infection. There are currently no oral agents approved to treat NTM infection. Only one drug is approved to treat NTM infection that would potentially compete with SPR720 called Arikayce from Insmed, an inhaled version of a commonly used drug in the hospital setting called amikacin. It should be noted that combination therapy is recommended for treating this condition.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, clinical trials, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, authorization, pharmacovigilance, adverse event reporting, recalls, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products and product candidates such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
Recent Changes in the Regulatory Landscape 
 The FDA’s Division of Anti-Infective Products, or DAIP, has undergone evolution in recent years, primarily driven by concerns that increasingly less effective antibiotics may have been approved in the last 10 to 15 years and a desire to bring what DAIP perceives to be greater statistical rigor to their analyses. The impact of this was a rethinking of how antibiotic efficacy is measured in clinical trials, and a review of the statistical tools used to analyze the data. In February 2015, the FDA published guidance documents for industry entitled “Complicated Urinary Tract Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment” and guidance entitled “Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections: Developing Drugs for Treatment.” The purpose of these guidance documents is to address considerations surrounding the clinical development of drugs for cUTI and cIAI indications, including clinical trial design and efficacy. Additionally, in August 2017, the FDA published a guidance document entitled “Antibacterial Therapies for Patients With an Unmet Medical Need for the Treatment of Serious Bacterial Diseases,” setting forth its current thinking with respect to development programs and clinical trial designs for antibacterial drugs to treat serious bacterial diseases. 
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Cures Act, which is intended to accelerate medical product development. Section 3042 of the Cures Act establishes the limited population pathway for certain antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat targeted groups of patients suffering from serious or life-threatening infections where unmet need exists. Approvals of these limited population drugs are expected to rely on data from smaller clinical trials than would ordinarily be required by the FDA. For drugs approved through this pathway, the statement “Limited Population” will appear prominently next to the drug’s name in labeling, which is intended to provide notice to healthcare providers that the drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of patients. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an 
 25


approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with GLP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of audits of clinical trial sites conducted by FDA to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees and securing FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Preclinical tests intended for submission to the FDA to support the safety of a product candidate must be conducted in compliance with GLP regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. A drug sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial along with the requirement to ensure that the data and results reported from the clinical trials are credible and accurate. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the criteria for determining subject eligibility, the dosing plan, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the procedure for timely reporting of adverse events, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s or biological product’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
 26


Phase 2: The drug is administered to a larger, but still limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well-controlled and closely monitored. 
 Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve a larger number of participants than a Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Results from one trial may not be predictive of results from subsequent trials. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. Furthermore, the FDA is not required to complete its review within the established ten-month timeframe and may extend the review process by issuing requests for additional information or clarification. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facilities in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meet standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP. 
 The FDA generally accepts data from foreign clinical trials in support of an NDA if the trials were conducted under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the FDA nevertheless may accept the data in support of an NDA if the study was 
 27


conducted in accordance with GCPs and the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection, if deemed necessary. Although the FDA generally requests that marketing applications be supported by some data from domestic clinical trials, the FDA may accept foreign data as the sole basis for marketing approval if (1) the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, (2) the studies were performed by clinical investigators with recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection or, if the FDA considers the inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. 
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. 
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling , require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or if the drug qualifies as a QIDP under the GAIN Act. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment for a serious condition, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, meaning that it may be approved on (i) the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (ii) on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to 
 28


verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
 Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products that are placed on the market. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved, and approved drugs may generally be promoted only for their approved indications. Promotional claims must also be consistent with the product’s FDA-approved label, including claims related to safety and effectiveness. The FDA and other federal agencies also closely regulate the promotion of drugs in specific contexts such as direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and education activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences of regulatory non-compliance include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on, or suspensions of, the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | interruption of production processes, including the shutdown of manufacturing facilities or production lines or the imposition of new manufacturing requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Exclusivity and Approval of Competing Products 
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity 
 Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the activity of the drug substance. We believe that our product candidates are new chemical entities. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application or supplement. Three-year exclusivity may be awarded for changes to a previously approved drug product, such as new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. For drug products that contain an “antibiotic” ingredient approved prior to 1997, the statute imposes certain limitations on the award of non-patent exclusivity. However, we do not believe these limitations would apply to SPR994 or any of our other investigational antibiotics. 
Qualified Infectious Disease Product Exclusivity 
 Under the GAIN Act provisions of FDASIA, which was signed into law in July 2012, the FDA may designate a product as a qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP. In order to receive this designation, a drug must qualify as an antibiotic or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by either (i) an antibiotic or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens, or (ii) a so-called “qualifying pathogen” found on a list of potentially dangerous, drug-resistant organisms to be established and maintained by the FDA under the new law. A sponsor must request such designation before submitting a marketing application. We obtained a QIDP designation for the oral formulation of SPR994 for cUTI in November 2016 and CABP and DFI in April 2017. We were granted QIDP designation by the FDA for SPR206 in October 2018 for the treatment of cUTI and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP). We were granted QIDP designation for SPR720 capsule for oral use for the treatment of lung infections caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria and for the treatment of lung infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 Upon approving an application for a qualified infectious disease product, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new molecular entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded, and the extension will be awarded only to a drug first approved on or after the date of enactment. 
 The GAIN Act provisions prohibit the grant of an exclusivity extension where the application is a supplement to an application for which an extension is in effect or has expired, is a subsequent application for a specified change to an approved product, or is an application for a product that does not meet the definition of qualified infectious disease product based on the uses for which it is ultimately approved. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union and Australia, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the 
 30


conduct of clinical trials, product authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Before clinical trials may be conducted in any EU Member State, a sponsor must submit a clinical trial authorization application, or CTA, which must be approved in each country in which the sponsor intends to perform a clinical trial. The procedure for submitting a CTA was set forth in an existing EU Clinical Trial Directive. However, the way clinical trials are conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when the Clinical Trial Regulation becomes effective in 2019. The Regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU, via an EU portal and database. The European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, will set up and maintain the portal and database, in collaboration with the Member States and the European Commission.
 The goal of Clinical Trial Regulation is to create an environment that is favorable to conducting clinical trials in the EU, with the highest standards of safety for participants and increased transparency of trial information. The Regulation will require consistent rules for conducting clinical trials throughout the EU and information on the authorization, conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the EU to be publicly available. 
 When the Regulation becomes applicable, it will replace the existing EU Clinical Trial Directive and national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. It will also apply to trials authorized under the previous legislation if they are still ongoing three years after the Regulation becomes effective. The authorization and oversight of clinical trials will remain the responsibility of Member States, with EMA managing the database and supervising content publication on the public website.
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, such as government health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and limiting the coverage and reimbursement amounts for medical products and services. 
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority for federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of the product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 In the United States, the federal government provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions irrespective of their age, through the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined in accordance with the Social Security Act and pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS, as well as the agency’s coverage and reimbursement guidance and determinations. Drugs and other products that are utilized within the hospital in-patient setting are typically reimbursed under a prospective payment system, or a predetermined payment amount that is based on diagnosis related groups, or DRGs for Medicare patients and under a bundled payment for commercially insured patients. These payment amounts differ by type of diagnoses, procedures performed and the severity of the patient’s condition, among other things. A drug that is used in a treatment or procedure under a specific DRG or bundled payment is generally not eligible for any separate payment. For 
 31


catastrophic cases where costs greatly exceed the bundled payment amount, the hospital may be eligible for an outlier payment that is intended to cover part of the expense above the standard payment. 
 Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologicals of manufacturers that have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, although such drugs and biologicals may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls. 
 The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. For example, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as the ACA, among other things, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Both Congress and President Trump have expressed their intention to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA, and as a result certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. The uncertainty around the future of the ACA, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the EU, the sole legal instrument at the EU level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products is Council Directive 89/105/EEC, or the Price Transparency Directive. The aim of this Directive is to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in the EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement of and trade in medicinal products in the EU, and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria on the basis of which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States, nor does it have any direct consequence for pricing or reimbursement levels in individual EU Member States. The EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and/or reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price or level of reimbursement for the medicinal product, or alternatively adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company responsible for placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. 
 Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. The HTA process in the EU Member States is governed by the national laws of these countries. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact, and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product vary between EU Member States. A negative HTA of one of our products by a leading and recognized HTA body, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, could not only undermine our ability to obtain reimbursement for such product in the EU Member State in which such negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States. For example, EU Member States that have not yet developed HTA mechanisms could rely to some extent on the HTA performed in countries with a developed HTA framework, such as the United Kingdom, when adopting decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of a specific medicinal product.

Other Healthcare Laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance, and finished drug product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We currently employ internal resources to manage our manufacturing. We intend to have two suppliers for SPR994’s active pharmaceutical ingredient. Each supplier would be capable of producing kilogram quantities for commercial scale and would be able to produce over 10kg of active pharmaceutical ingredient under cGMP conditions. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 41 full-time employees, including a total of 14 employees with M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. 25 employees were primarily engaged in research and development activities, with the rest providing administrative, business and operations support. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
