Item 1.  Business
General
HNI Corporation (the ''Corporation'', ''we'', ''us'', or ''our'') is an Iowa corporation incorporated in 1944.  The Corporation is a provider of office furniture and hearth products.  Office furniture products include panel-based and freestanding furniture systems, seating, storage, and tables. These products are sold primarily through a national system of independent dealers, wholesalers, and office product distributors but also directly to end-user customers and federal, state, and local governments.  Hearth products include a full array of gas, wood, and pellet burning fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings, and accessories.  These products are sold through a national system of independent dealers and distributors, as well as Corporation-owned distribution and retail outlets.  In fiscal 2018, the Corporation had net sales of $2.3 billion, of which $1.7 billion or 76 percent was attributable to office furniture products and $0.6 billion or 24 percent was attributable to hearth products.  See "Note 17. Reportable Segment Information" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about operating segments.
The Corporation is organized into a corporate headquarters and operating units with offices, manufacturing plants, distribution centers, and sales showrooms in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Dubai, Taiwan, and Singapore.  See "Item 2. Properties" for additional related discussion.
Eight operating units, marketed under various brand names, participate in the office furniture industry.  These operating units include:  
The HON Company LLC ("HON")
Allsteel Inc. ("Allsteel")
Maxon Furniture Inc. ("Maxon")
The Gunlocke Company LLC ("Gunlocke")
Hickory Business Furniture, LLC (''HBF'')
OFM LLC ("OFM")
HNI Hong Kong Limited (''Lamex'')
HNI Office India Limited ("HNI India")
Each of these operating units provides products, which are sold through various channels of distribution and segments of the industry.
The operating unit Hearth & Home Technologies LLC (''Hearth & Home'') participates in the hearth products industry.  The retail and distribution brand for this operating unit is Fireside Hearth & Home.
The Corporation has been committed to systematically eliminating waste through its process improvement approach known as Rapid Continuous Improvement (''RCI''), which focuses on streamlining design, manufacturing, and administrative processes.  The Corporation's RCI program has contributed to increased productivity, lower costs, improved product quality, enhanced workplace safety, and improved lead times.
The Corporation's product development efforts are focused on developing and providing relevant and differentiated solutions, delivering quality, aesthetics, and style.
An important element of the Corporation's success has been its member-owner culture, which has enabled it to attract, develop, retain, and motivate skilled, experienced, and efficient members (i.e., employees).  Each of the Corporation's eligible members has the opportunity to own stock in the Corporation through a number of stock-based plans, including a member stock purchase plan and a profit-sharing retirement plan. These ownership opportunities drive a unique level of commitment to the Corporation’s success throughout the workforce. Members own approximately 6 percent of the Corporation's stock.

The U.S. office furniture market consists of two primary channels — the contract channel and the supplies-driven channel.  The contract channel has traditionally been characterized by sales of office furniture and services to large corporations, primarily for new office facilities, relocations, or office redesigns. Sales to the contract channel are frequently customized to meet specific client and designer preferences.  Contract furniture is generally purchased through independent office furniture dealers who prepare a custom-designed office layout emphasizing image and design.  The selling process is complex, lengthy, and generally has several manufacturers competing for the same projects.
The supplies-driven channel, in which the Corporation is a leader, primarily represents smaller orders of office furniture purchased by small/medium businesses. Sales in this channel are driven on the basis of price, quality, selection, speed, and reliability of delivery.  Office products dealers, wholesalers, and national office product distributors are the primary distribution channels in this market.
The Corporation also competes in the hearth products industry, where it is a market leader.  Hearth products are typically purchased by builders during the construction of new homes and homeowners during the renovation of existing homes.  Both types of purchases involve seasonality with remodel/retrofit activity being concentrated in the September to December time-frame.  Distribution is primarily through independent dealers, who may buy direct from the manufacturer or from an intermediate distributor.
Strategy
The Corporation's strategy is to build on its position as a leading manufacturer of office furniture and hearth products in North America and pursue select global markets where opportunities exist to create shareholder value.  The components of this growth strategy are to introduce new products, build brand equity, provide outstanding customer satisfaction, strengthen the distribution network, pursue complementary strategic acquisitions, enter markets not currently served, and continually reduce costs.
The Corporation’s strategy has a dual focus: working continuously to extract new growth from its core markets while identifying and developing new, adjacent potential areas of growth.  The Corporation focuses on extracting new growth from each of its existing businesses by deepening its understanding of end-users and using the insights gained to refine branding, selling, marketing, and product development.  The Corporation also pursues opportunities in potential growth drivers related to its core business, such as vertical markets or new distribution models.
Employees/Members
As of December 29, 2018, the Corporation employed approximately 8,900 persons, 8,700 of whom were full-time and 200 of whom were temporary personnel.  The Corporation believes its labor relations are good.

Heatilator®, Heat & Glo®, Majestic®, Monessen®, and Stellar HearthTM are brand leaders in the two largest segments of the home fireplace market: gas and wood fireplaces.  The Corporation is a leader in "direct vent" fireplaces, which replaces the chimney-venting system used in traditional fireplaces with a less expensive vent through the roof or an outer wall.  In addition, the Corporation is a market leader in wood and pellet-burning stoves with its Quadra-Fire®, Harman®, Vermont Castings®, and PelPro® product lines, which provide home heating solutions using renewable fuels.  See "Intellectual Property" below for additional details.
Manufacturing
The Corporation manufactures office furniture in Georgia, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, China, and India.  The Corporation manufactures hearth products in Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Vermont.
The Corporation purchases raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers and generally, most items are available from multiple sources.  Major raw materials and components include coil steel, aluminum, zinc, castings, lumber, veneer, particleboard, fabric, paint, lacquer, hardware, glass, plastic products, and shipping cartons.
Since its inception, the Corporation has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while reducing cost, eliminating waste, and improving product quality.  The Corporation applies the principles of RCI and a lean manufacturing philosophy leveraging the creativity of its members to eliminate and reduce costs.  To achieve flexibility and attain efficiency goals, the Corporation has adopted a variety of production techniques, including cellular manufacturing, focused factories, just-in-time inventory management, value engineering, business simplification, and 80/20 principles.  The application of RCI has increased productivity by reducing set-up, processing times, square footage, inventory levels, product costs, and delivery times, while improving quality and enhancing member safety.  The Corporation's RCI process involves members, customers, and suppliers.  Manufacturing also plays a key role in the Corporation's concurrent product development process in order to design new products for ease of manufacturability.
Product Development
The Corporation's product development efforts are primarily focused on developing relevant and differentiated end-user solutions focused on quality, aesthetics, style, sustainable design, and reduced manufacturing costs.  The Corporation accomplishes this through improving existing products, extending product lines, applying ergonomic research, improving manufacturing processes, leveraging alternative materials, and providing engineering support to its operating units.  The Corporation conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit levels.  The Corporation invested in product development as follows (in thousands):

 | 2018 | | 2017 | 2016
Product development investments | $ | 33,420 | | $ | 31,846 | $ | 28,089

Intellectual Property
As of December 29, 2018, the Corporation owned 164 U.S. and 152 foreign patents with expiration dates through 2042 and had applications pending for 19 U.S. and 46 foreign patents.  In addition, the Corporation holds 185 U.S. and 422 foreign trademark registrations and has applications pending for 23 U.S. and 15 foreign trademarks.

The Corporation's principal office furniture products do not require frequent technical changes.  The Corporation believes neither any individual office furniture patent nor the Corporation's office furniture patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation's business as a whole.
The Corporation’s patents covering its hearth products protect various technical innovations.  While the acquisition of patents reflects Hearth & Home’s position in the market as an innovation leader, the Corporation believes neither any individual hearth product patent nor the Corporation’s hearth product patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation’s business as a whole.
The Corporation applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified and the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights.  The Corporation also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others.
The Corporation applies for trademark protection for brands and products when it believes the expense of doing so is justified. The Corporation actively protects trademarks it believes have significant value. The Corporation believes neither the loss of any individual trademark nor the loss of the Corporation's trademarks in the aggregate would materially or adversely affect the Corporation's business as a whole, except for HON, Allsteel, Heat & Glo, and Heatilator.
Sales and Distribution: Customers
The Corporation sells its office furniture products through five principal distribution channels.  The first channel, consisting of independent, local office products dealers, specializes in the sale of office furniture to business, government, education, and health care entities.
The second distribution channel is comprised of national office product distributors that sell furniture and office supplies through a national network of dealerships and sales offices.  These distributors also sell through on-line and retail office products stores.
The third distribution channel involves the Corporation having the lead selling relationship with the end-user.
The fourth distribution channel is comprised of wholesalers serving as distributors of the Corporation's products to independent dealers and national office products distributors. Wholesalers maintain inventory of standard product lines for resale to the various independent dealers and national office products distributors.
The fifth distribution channel is comprised of direct sales of the Corporation's products to federal, state, and local government offices.
The Corporation's office furniture sales force consists of regional sales managers, salespersons, and firms of independent manufacturers' representatives who collectively provide national sales coverage.  Sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and variable performance compensation.
Independent office products dealers, national wholesalers, and national office product distributors market their products over the internet and through catalogs periodically published and distributed to existing and potential customers.
The Corporation also makes export sales through HNI International to independent office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets.  Distributors are principally located in the Middle East, Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean.  Through Lamex and HNI India, the Corporation manufactures and distributes office furniture directly to end-users and through independent dealers and distributors in Asia, primarily China and India.
Limited quantities of select finished goods inventories primarily built to order and awaiting shipment are at the Corporation's principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers. Additionally, the Corporation holds select finished goods inventories to enable direct fulfillment capabilities.
Hearth & Home sells its fireplace and stove products through independent dealers, distributors, and Corporation-owned distribution and retail outlets.  The Corporation has a field sales organization of regional sales managers, salespersons, and firms of independent manufacturers' representatives.
In fiscal 2018, the Corporation's five largest customers represented approximately 22 percent of its consolidated net sales. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Corporation’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018.  The substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the Corporation can successfully offer its products.

The Corporation has an order backlog, which will be filled in the ordinary course of business. The order backlog includes orders that might be cancelable for a period of time and almost all orders will be fulfilled within one year. Order backlog in dollars and in terms of percentage of net sales was as follows (in thousands):

 | December 29, 2018 | | December 30, 2017
Net sales | $ | 2,257,895 | | | $ | 2,175,882
Order backlog | $ | 181,522 | | | $ | 202,255 
Percent of net sales | 8.0 | % | | 9.3 | %

The Corporation’s products are typically manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order or later upon customer request.  Therefore, the dollar amount of the Corporation’s order backlog is not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the Corporation’s expected sales in any particular fiscal period.
Competition
The Corporation is a leading global office furniture manufacturer and is North America's largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces.
The office furniture industry is highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products.  The Corporation competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products, solutions, and a high level of tailored customer service.  The Corporation competes with large office furniture manufacturers, which cover a substantial portion of the North America market share in the contract-oriented office furniture market, including manufacturers such as Steelcase Inc., Haworth, Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., and Knoll, Inc.  The Corporation also competes with a number of other office furniture manufacturers, including The Global Group (a Canadian company), Kimball International, Inc., Krueger International Inc. (KI), and Teknion Corporation (a Canadian company), as well as global importers.  The Corporation faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants.
Hearth products, consisting of prefabricated fireplaces and related products, are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors.  The Corporation competes against a broad range of manufacturers, including Travis Industries Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon), and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).
Both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of performance, quality, price, customer service, and complete and on-time delivery.  The Corporation believes it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality, performance, superior customer service, and short lead-times.  This is made possible, in part, by the Corporation's on-going investment in brands, product development, low cost manufacturing operations, and extensive distribution network.
Effects of Inflation
Certain business costs may, from time to time, increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation.  The Corporation’s objective is to offset the effect of normal inflation primarily through productivity improvements combined with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit.
Investments are routinely made in modernizing plants, equipment, information technology, and RCI programs.  These investments collectively focus on business simplification and increasing productivity, which help to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs. The Corporation also routinely employs ongoing cost control disciplines.  In addition, the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method is used for most of the Corporation's inventories. The use of LIFO ensures changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income and pricing decisions.
Environmental
The Corporation is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing the use of materials and substances in products, the management of wastes resulting from use of certain material, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances used in the past.  Although the Corporation believes it is substantially compliant with all of the various regulations applicable to its business, there can be no assurance requirements will not change in the future or the Corporation will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations.  The Corporation has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance 
 8

with environmental, health, and safety requirements.  The Corporation’s staff works with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility, the Corporation’s environmental legal counsel, and consultants on the management of environmental, health, and safety issues.  The Corporation’s environmental objective is to reduce and, when practical, eliminate the human and ecosystem impacts of materials and manufacturing processes.
Over the past several years, the Corporation has expanded its environmental management system and established metrics to influence product design and development, supplier and supply chain performance, energy and resource consumption, and the impacts of its facilities.  In addition, the Corporation is providing sustainability training to senior decision makers and has assigned resources to documenting and communicating its progress to an increasingly knowledgeable market.  Integrating sustainable objectives into core business systems is consistent with the Corporation’s vision, ensures its commitment to being a sustainable enterprise, and remains a priority for all members.
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Corporation to date.  The Corporation does not anticipate financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal 2019 for environmental control facilities.  In management’s judgment, compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition or results of operations.  However, there can be no assurance new environmental legislation, material science, or technology in this area will not result in or require material capital expenditures.
Business Development
The development of the Corporation's business during the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018, December 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016 is discussed in ''Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II of this report.
