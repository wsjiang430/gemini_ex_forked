ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. was formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intends to operate in such manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and as required by context, KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on December 10, 2008 (the “Operating Partnership”), and its subsidiaries. KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”) is our advisor. As our advisor, KBS Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of investments. KBS Capital Advisors also has the authority to make all of the decisions regarding our investments, subject to the limitations in our charter and the direction and oversight of our board of directors. KBS Capital Advisors also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. We have sought to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner.
On January 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of 140,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 100,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 40,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on November 14, 2012. We sold 56,584,976 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $561.7 million. We continue to offer shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan. As of December 31, 2018, we had sold 6,743,625 shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $75.5 million. Also as of December 31, 2018, we had redeemed 22,778,730 of the shares sold in our offering for $275.4 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had issued 25,976,746 shares of common stock in connection with special dividends. Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, we issued 220,994 shares and 55,249 shares of common stock, respectively, for $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On March 2, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity (BVI) Holdings, Ltd. (“KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI”), our wholly owned subsidiary, filed a final prospectus with the Israel Securities Authority for a proposed offering of up to 1,000,000,000 Israeli new Shekels of Series A debentures (the “Debentures”) at an annual interest rate not to exceed 4.25%. On March 1, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the institutional tender of the Debentures and accepted application for 842.5 million Israeli new Shekels. On March 7, 2016, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI commenced the public tender of the Debentures and accepted 127.7 million Israeli new Shekels. In the aggregate, KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI accepted 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately $249.2 million as of March 8, 2016) in both the institutional and public tenders at an annual interest rate of 4.25%. KBS Strategic Opportunity BVI issued the Debentures on March 8, 2016. The terms of the Debentures require five equal principal installment payments annually on March 1st of each year from 2019 to 2023. 
As of December 31, 2018, we consolidated six office properties, one office portfolio consisting of four office buildings and 14 acres of undeveloped land, one retail property, two apartment properties (of which one apartment property was held for sale) and three investments in undeveloped land with approximately 1,000 developable acres and owned three investments in unconsolidated joint ventures, an investment in real estate debt securities and three investments in real estate equity securities.
Objectives and Strategies
Our primary investment objectives are: 

• | to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable returns; and


• | to preserve and return our stockholders’ capital contributions.

We have sought to achieve these objectives by investing in and managing a portfolio of real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments. We acquired our investments through a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering, debt financing and proceeds from the Debentures offering. We plan to lease-up and stabilize existing assets. We plan to explore value-add opportunities for existing assets and seek to realize growth in the value of our investments by timing asset sales to maximize their value. We also intend to actively pursue additional lending and investment opportunities that we believe will provide an attractive risk-adjusted return to our stockholders.

Real Estate Investments
As of December 31, 2018, we consolidated six office properties, one office portfolio consisting of four office buildings and 14 acres of undeveloped land and one retail property encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 3.0 million rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2018, these properties were 74% occupied. In addition, we owned two apartment properties (of which one apartment property was held for sale), containing 383 units and encompassing approximately 0.3 million rentable square feet, which were 94% occupied. We also consolidated three investments in undeveloped land with approximately 1,000 developable acres. In addition, we owned three investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.
We have attempted to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2018, we had no tenants that represented more than 10% of our total annualized base rent and our top ten tenants represented approximately 8% of our total annualized base rent. The total cost of our real estate held for investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was $696.2 million. The total cost of our real estate property held for sale as of December 31, 2018 was $34.8 million. For more information about our real estate investments, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Real Estate-Related Investments
As of December 31, 2018, we owned an investment in real estate debt securities with a total book value of $10.9 million. These real estate debt securities had an annual effective interest rate of 11.4% as of December 31, 2018. Also as of December 31, 2018, we owned three investments in real estate equity securities with a total book value of $73.9 million.
Financing Objectives
We have financed the majority of our real estate and real estate-related investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to potentially increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 4.3%. 
We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of December 31, 2018, we had $289.5 million and $373.8 million of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018 were each 4.3%. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2018, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2018, where applicable. As of December 31, 2018, we had entered into one interest rate cap with a notional amount of $46.9 million that effectively limits one-month LIBOR at 3.0% effective February 21, 2017 through February 13, 2020 and one interest rate cap with a notional amount of $77.5 million that effectively limits one-month LIBOR at 3.5% effective April 2, 2018 through March 5, 2021.
In March 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, issued 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately $249.2 million as of March 8, 2016) in 4.25% bonds to investors in Israel pursuant to a public offering registered in Israel. The bonds have a seven year term, with 20% of the principal payable each year from 2019 to 2023. We used the proceeds from the issuance of these bonds to make additional investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had entered into one foreign currency collar to hedge against a change in the exchange rate of the Israeli new Shekel versus the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency collar expired in February 2019 and had an aggregate Israeli new Shekels notional amount of 776.2 million. The foreign currency collar consisted of a purchased call option to buy Israeli new Shekels at 3.5445 and a sold put option to sell the Israeli new Shekels at 3.6592. The foreign currency collar is intended to permit us to exchange, on the settlement date of the collar, 776.2 million Israeli new Shekels for an amount ranging from $212.1 million to $219.0 million. On February 27, 2019, we entered into a foreign currency collar with an aggregate Israeli new Shekels notional amount of 776.2 million which expires on August 23, 2019. The foreign currency collar consists of a purchased call option to buy Israeli new Shekels at 3.4860 and a sold put option to sell the Israeli new Shekels at 3.6185. The foreign currency collar is intended to permit us to exchange, on the settlement date of the collar, 776.2 million Israeli new Shekels for an amount ranging from $214.5 million to $222.7 million.

We have tried to spread the maturity dates of our debt to minimize maturity and refinance risk in our portfolio. In addition, a majority of our debt allows us to extend the maturity dates, subject to certain conditions. Although we believe we will satisfy the conditions to extend the maturity of our debt obligations, we can give no assurance in this regard. The following table shows the current and fully extended maturities, including principal amortization payments, of our debt as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): 

 | Current Maturity | | Extended Maturity
2019 | $ | 102,469 | | | $ | 102,469
2020 | 104,070 | | | 52,898 | 
2021 | 272,311 | | | 55,278 | 
2022 | 127,155 | | | 129,320 | 
2023 | 52,158 | | | 264,994 | 
Thereafter | 5,155 | | | 58,359 | 
 | $ | 663,318 | | | $ | 663,318

There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment. Our charter limits our total liabilities to 75% of the cost of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2018, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 68% and 67% of the cost (before depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively.
We do not intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. High levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors, and could also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. High levels of debt could also increase the risk of being unable to refinance when loans become due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms, and the risk of loss with respect to assets pledged as collateral for loans. 
Except with respect to the borrowing limits contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our debt policy in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, any investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to book value in connection with any change of our borrowing policies.
Disposition Policies 
The period that we will hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates and other factors. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each investment we have made. KBS Capital Advisors will continually perform a hold-sell analysis on each asset in order to determine the optimal time to hold the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one office building, one office/flex/industrial portfolio consisting of 21 buildings and 124 developable acres of undeveloped land and classified one property as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 1,986,295 shares of common stock of Whitestone REIT. The disposition strategy is consistent with our objectives of acquiring opportunistic investments, improving the investments and timing asset sales to realize the growth in the value that was created during our hold period. 
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, origination, acquisition and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide the respective services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources.

Competitive Market Factors
The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We may also face competition from other entities that are selling assets. Competition from these entities may increase the supply of real estate investment opportunities or increase the bargaining power of real estate investors seeking to buy. 
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively.
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 
All of our real estate properties, other than properties acquired through foreclosure, were subject to Phase I environmental assessments at the time they were acquired. Some of the properties we have acquired are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Segments
We have invested in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets. In general, we intend to hold our investments in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, our management views non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments. Substantially all of our revenue and net income (loss) is from non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets, and therefore, we currently aggregate our operating segments into one reportable business segment.
Employees
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. 
Principal Executive Office
Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Newport Center Drive, Suite 700, Newport Beach, California 92660. Our telephone number, general facsimile number and web address are (949) 417-6500, (949) 417-6501 and www.kbsstrategicopportunityreit.com, respectively.
