Overview 
 Veritone, Inc. (collectively with our subsidiaries, referred to as “Veritone,” “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”) computing solutions. We have developed aiWARE™, a proprietary AI operating system that integrates and orchestrates an open ecosystem of over 300 top performing cognitive engines, together with our suite of powerful applications, to reveal valuable multivariate insights from vast amounts of structured and unstructured data and conduct cognitive workflows based on these insights. 
 Our aiWARE platform incorporates proprietary technology to integrate and intelligently orchestrate a wide variety of cognitive engine capabilities to mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, prediction and problem solving in order to quickly, efficiently and cost effectively transform unstructured data into structured data. It stores the results in a time-correlated database, creating a rich, online, searchable index of the structured and unstructured data that users can use and analyze in near real-time through the platform’s suite of general and industry-specific applications to drive business processes and insights. 
 Our platform is based on an open architecture that enables new cognitive engines and applications to be added quickly and efficiently, resulting in a future proof, scalable and evolving solution that can be easily leveraged for a broad range of industries that capture or use audio, video and other unstructured data including, without limitation, the media and entertainment, legal and compliance, government and other vertical markets. Our aiWARE platform is offered through a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) delivery model and can be deployed in a number of environments and configurations to meet customers’ needs.
 We also operate a full service advertising agency, which we acquired at the time we were founded in 2014.  Our services include media planning and strategy, advertisement buying and placement, campaign messaging, clearance verification and attribution, and custom analytics.  Our advertising business leverages our aiWARE platform to help our clients improve their advertising placements and maximize the return on their advertising spending using real-time ad verification and analytics, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over other advertising agencies.  Although we intend to focus on the development and growth of our aiWARE SaaS solutions, we plan to continue to invest in and grow our advertising business. 
 Acquisitions 
 In December 2017, we acquired the advanced data analytics software and related intellectual property assets of Atigeo Corporation, including a cooperative distributed inferencing (“CDI”) system — based on Hamiltonian models and other proprietary algorithms — that enables queries within huge bodies of unstructured data where straight computational, traditional machine learning and manual approaches are impractical, if not impossible. This strategic acquisition has added proprietary machine learning capabilities to our growing body of technology and intellectual property in data science and will help us further refine our conducted learning. We are currently working to apply our CDI technology to a number of use cases, including intelligent control of batteries and microgrids, medical imaging and cybersecurity.
 In August 2018, we acquired Wazee Digital, Inc. (“Wazee Digital”), a leading provider of digital content management and licensing services. Wazee Digital’s offerings include Core, an enterprise level, cloud-native digital asset management platform used by content owners to store, retrieve and manage video and still images, and Digital Media Hub, an intuitive web portal through which content owners can offer secure, cloud-native global access to their content to key stakeholders, including news media and corporate partners.  These offerings serve customers primarily in the media and entertainment market, enabling these customers to more effectively monetize and enrich their content.  
 Wazee Digital also offers digital content licensing services, through which it manages and licenses content on behalf of leading rights holders in the film, television, sports, and advertising industries.  Content is licensed either through Wazee Digital’s own Commerce web portal or through customer-branded web portals.  Wazee Digital also provides services for live events, such as major sporting events, that allow content owners to capture and tag live television broadcast content and make it immediately available for global highlights, publishing and syndication.
 We have integrated the cognitive functionality of our aiWARE platform with the Wazee Digital solutions and services, which allows us to provide our customers with unique capabilities to drive expanded revenue opportunities from their video, still image and audio assets.

 In September 2018, we acquired Machine Box, Inc. (“Machine Box”), a developer of state-of-the-art machine learning technologies, which have enhanced the capabilities of our aiWARE platform.  Machine Box’s technologies give organizations a suite of simple yet robust tools and models to create customized AI engines across multiple cognitive categories, including face and object recognition, data classification and personalized recommendation, which can be deployed to enhance new or existing business solutions. When coupled with aiWARE, developers, systems integrators and end customers are able to produce bespoke, end-to-end AI-informed solutions for their specific use cases.
 We plan to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses and technologies that strengthen our business, enhance our capabilities and/or expand our market presence in our core vertical markets or in new markets. 
 aiWARE SaaS Solutions
 aiWARE Overview 
 Our innovative aiWARE platform intelligently orchestrates an ecosystem of top performing cognitive engines within a single software solution to process information in volumes that can far exceed human cognitive capabilities. Our proprietary technology enables users to run comprehensive, multivariate queries, correlations and analyses in near real-time using cognitive engines across multiple categories, such as transcription, face recognition and object recognition, creating integrated and refined outputs. Our suite of general and industry-specific applications enables users to leverage the power of our aiWARE platform to perform key processes far more efficiently and with greater scalability than their existing manual processes.  Our solution can also ingest structured data for analysis in conjunction with the processed data. For example, our media users can use our system to identify instances where advertiser names or logos appear in a broadcast, and then correlate those instances with audience ratings data (such as Nielsen data) to measure the number of impressions generated by the ad, web traffic data (such as Google Analytics data) to estimate the traffic driven by the ad, or their own sales data, to provide actionable intelligence regarding their advertising campaigns. 
 Our aiWARE platform encompasses the following processes, which are discussed in more detail below: 
  
• | Ingestion: Our platform captures and ingests structured and unstructured data through various adapters that are specific to each ingestion source and normalizes the ingested data for further processing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Orchestration and Processing: Once source data is captured into our platform through the ingestion process, it is transcoded and run through one or more cognitive engines depending on the information and analysis desired by the end user, which extract from and/or add useful metadata to the media. Our proprietary Conductor™ technology analyzes source data files and intelligently routes them to the most appropriate transcription engine(s) to optimize processing performance. We are working to extend Conductor’s capabilities to other cognitive classes, such as object recognition.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary Indexing and Storage: The metadata produced by our cognitive processing is indexed and stored in a temporal elastic database that correlates disparate metadata derived from various cognitive engines across our platform, as well as third-party datasets, providing comprehensive search capabilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applications and Cognitive Analytics: Once the media has been indexed and stored, cognitive analytics can be deployed to uncover relationships, enable insights and recommend actions. We have developed a suite of core applications, and several industry targeted applications, to facilitate the use of our platform and enable users to discover patterns across a diverse set of media to correlate data, optimize objectives and provide near real-time insights.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2018, we enhanced our aiWARE architecture to enable the platform to support real-time cognitive processing for a growing number of use cases, particularly in the areas of compliance, public safety and surveillance.  The platform’s real-time framework enables users to leverage data in seconds, optimizing their workflows and compliance.  We have transitioned almost all of the content ingested and processed in the platform onto this improved framework. 
 2

Ingestion and Adapters
 Data exists in a myriad of formats.  We have built a scalable, source and type agnostic ingestion process that utilizes adapters, which are lightweight, pluggable software modules that have been purpose-built on our real-time framework to capture audio or video media or other data from wherever it resides, to ingest it into our platform for further processing, actions and analytics. Adapters are specific to the ingestion source type and allow for media from that source to be processed through our recording infrastructure and flow through our platform. Our ingestion process includes an adapter module framework that enables aiWARE to dynamically load data from external sources and repositories (i.e. Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox, Box, Google Drive, HTTP/RTSP/RTMP Streams, IP-based cameras, etc.) automatically. Our solution enables external developers to write these adapters to extend the platform to be able to ingest additional data sources. We plan to continue to expand our current collection of adapters to enable the capture of an increasingly diverse array of data types and formats, whether industry-standard or proprietary, over time.  
 During 2018, we expanded the capabilities of aiWARE to ingest and process structured data such as public and private databases, enabling developers to create applications that can analyze such data and/or correlate it with unstructured data such as audio, video and photos, further expanding the universe of potential use cases for our customers.
 Cognitive Engine Ecosystem
 Our platform includes an open ecosystem that allows third-party developers to easily integrate additional cognitive engines within our platform, which makes our solution readily scalable for a broad range of processes and vertical markets. We continually seek to add new engines in a variety of cognitive categories to address the needs of particular customer use cases and ensure that users can access a broad selection of capabilities from multiple vendors across many classes of cognition, all of which can be accessed via a simple, easy-to-use and tightly integrated platform. Our goal is to create a broad ecosystem, offering all major cognitive engine capabilities through a single open and integrated platform. We believe that our aiWARE platform incorporates more cognitive engines, across more classes of cognition, than any competitive offering. 
 Our innovative AI ecosystem currently incorporates over 300 cognitive engines of various classes and types from multiple third-party vendors, including Google, IBM, Microsoft, Nuance and Amazon, among others, in addition to several of our own proprietary cognitive engines, including our Machine Box engines. These cognitive engines use advanced algorithms to capture and extract data for a variety of cognitive processes, including transcription, face detection, face recognition, object detection, object recognition, sentiment analysis, language translation, audio/video fingerprinting, geolocation, visual moderation, optical character recognition, logo recognition, metadata extraction, and media format transcoding, among others. By having a number of engines from different providers within the same class, we are able to benchmark the engines to identify the optimal engine for a user’s needs and in some cases use them together to provide better overall accuracy than any single engine can achieve.  
 Our acquisition of Machine Box brought us state-of-the-art machine learning technology that developers can use to train their own custom engines.  For example, Objectbox™, which we launched in February 2019, allows developers to train it with their own content containing the desired objects to be detected, resulting in a high level of accuracy.  The resulting customized cognitive engine can then be deployed within aiWARE, giving users a production-ready environment with object detection output leverageable in an AI-enabled application or custom workflow. 
 Conductor Technology
 We have, and are developing, proprietary Conductor technology to analyze data and intelligently route it to the most appropriate cognitive engine(s) within a cognitive class to improve the performance of the data analysis process, enabling users to achieve higher accuracy and derive more robust intelligence from their data. For example, our Conductor for speech-to-text transcription uses multiple machine learning algorithms, including deep learning neural networks, to train, test and validate datasets to predict the best transcription engine for the user’s specific data, and in some cases to select and employ multiple engines, to maximize the accuracy of the transcription results. This capability enables our platform to produce higher transcription accuracy than a single engine solution, and is particularly important for use cases involving multi-language or multi-dialect voice recordings that require multiple transcription engines. 
 We are currently working to expand our Conductor technology to other cognitive classes and to develop inter-class capabilities. We believe that, in the future, the application of our proprietary inter-class Conductor technology will enable our aiWARE platform to derive contextual meaning from one cognitive class, such as object recognition, and apply this context and understanding to other classes of cognition, including transcription and facial recognition. We consider our Conductor technology to be a key competitive advantage for us, and we have filed patent applications covering various aspects of this technology.

Temporal Elastic Database 
 Once media has been processed on our aiWARE platform, we store the results of the cognitive engine processing in a scalable, time-correlated temporal elastic database, or TED. Utilizing this proprietary database, we have the unique ability to synthesize various disparate cognitive results in a cohesive, time-based format, allowing users to access multivariate intelligence previously unattainable from their audio or video media or other data. We can then dissect and analyze this information, producing a multi-dimensional index for ease of search, discovery and analytics. TED provides access to processed data through a dynamic multivariate toolset that enables queries of all elements within, around and derived from the data. Elements include, but are not limited to, cognitive engine outputs (transcripts, translations, recognized objects and faces, etc.), file metadata, structured datasets, and user-associated metadata such as content template outputs and freeform tags. 
 TED’s architecture leverages several commercial, open source, distributed and non-relational databases with proven scalability and performance characteristics. While storage agnostic, TED currently runs on Elasticsearch, leveraging the Apache Lucerne inverted index architecture. 
 Applications 
 We have developed our aiWARE Essentials, a suite of applications that comprise the base level services of our platform.  We have also developed several applications addressing specific customer use cases within our key markets.  The modular structure of our aiWARE platform enables rapid development of applications that unlock actionable insights from customer datasets that are relevant to the specific needs of different markets.  This allows us and third parties, including system integrators and end user customers, to quickly and easily build and deploy new applications on top of our aiWARE architecture.
 aiWARE Essentials
 Our aiWARE Essentials applications include the following: 
  
• | CMS. Content Management System (“CMS”) enables our users to ingest, process and search their media. The CMS application provides a common workflow for adding media sources through ingestion adapters. Cognitive workflows can be assigned to media sources, allowing the automated and customized processing of media from each distinct media source. Once media has been ingested into the CMS system, the media can be managed, reviewed, edited and further processed by cognitive engines within the application. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discovery. Discovery allows users to create and execute direct searches against cognitive engine output, either through predefined queries called Watchlists, or via ad-hoc searches. Once a user has generated a search result from a Watchlist or ad-hoc search, they are able to take several permission-controlled actions. These actions include viewing the media snippet, downloading the snippet, editing the cognitive engine metadata, verifying content in the search results and sharing the search results and associated media clips individually or including them as part of a Collection.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Collections. Collections presents groupings of search results or Watchlists in shareable units called Collections. A Collection of search results can be titled and described, then shared externally, via email, link or embedded widget. Users can edit the search results within a Collection from the application before sharing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Library. Library enables users to create libraries of reference training data such as known faces, objects, or audio files. Engines can then be trained against specific private or public libraries to facilitate specialized engine processing to maximize accuracy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attribute
 Attribute is an AI-powered media attribution application that tracks the efficacy of advertising in broadcast radio and television. The application delivers customer behavior impact analytics from pre-recorded, native and organic mentions, enabling broadcasters to analyze the effect of an advertiser’s advertising placements. The application systematically verifies advertisements and mentions in broadcasts and correlates them with the advertiser’s Google Analytics website data. The correlated information is displayed in a media attribution dashboard. Attribute empowers broadcaster sales representatives and campaign managers to demonstrate an advertiser’s campaign effectiveness and reveal data-driven insights for optimization of ad placements to drive greater customer return on investment (“ROI”), helping to drive increases in customer advertising spending.

IDentify
 Our IDentify application is a powerful AI-driven tool that enables law enforcement and judicial agencies to increase the speed and efficiency of investigative workflows.  IDentify allows users to upload and maintain booking and known offender databases in aiWARE and use facial recognition technology to automatically compare video and photographic evidence, such as footage from body cameras, dash cameras and CCTV surveillance cameras, with these databases to identify potential suspects for further investigation.  Users can optionally add detected but unknown faces to a persons of interest database for future digital evidence comparison.  Once users have reviewed and developed suspect lists from the processing results, they can share suspect information, including booking photo and information, with colleagues through the application.
 Redact
 Our Redact application enables law enforcement and judicial professionals to leverage AI to automate the redaction of faces and other sensitive information within video and image-based evidence, significantly streamlining their video evidence redaction workflows.  The application employs face detection technology to automatically detect faces in evidence for review and selection.  Users can define other sensitive items appearing in video evidence and choose to automatically track the defined items for redaction throughout the video or at a single time stamp.  The application then systematically obscures selected faces and sensitive data from the evidence.  Users can quickly download and share the redacted evidence, together with a report of all actions taken against redacted video evidence to support compliance with chain of custody requirements.
Veritone Developer Application 
 Our Veritone Developer application is a self-service development environment that empowers developers to create, submit and deploy cognitive engines and/or user applications directly into the aiWARE architecture. Veritone Developer enables cognitive engine developers to access our application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and developer toolkits to rapidly integrate their engines onto our aiWARE platform.  It also enables system integrators, end user customers or other application developers to access our APIs and developer toolkits to develop new private or public applications utilizing the metadata produced by our aiWARE platform.  This provides developers with a self-service mechanism to build on top of the core aiWARE architecture to satisfy specific use cases, or to create software products that can be distributed to Veritone’s user base as an extension of our core aiWARE offerings. 
Other Industry Targeted Applications
 We are currently developing an application that leverages our cognitive capabilities and Conductor technology to provide legal professionals with an effective means of searching voluminous sets of media and electronic documents to support their early case assessment efforts.  This application will allow users to rapidly ingest, process and search large volumes of audio, video, image and text-based documents, to identify and segregate relevant evidence for further review and analysis.  Once processed and reviewed through the application, users will be able to export the relevant subset of media and documents for transfer to their eDiscovery or case management platform for further processing and workflows.
 We are also developing an application to address compliance use cases for regulated industries such as financial services, insurance and healthcare. This compliance application will enable customers to use aiWARE to monitor a wide range of electronic communications, together with trading data, with a correlation engine to identify potential compliance issues and route the data to compliance personnel via preconfigured workflows. 
 Deployment Models 
 Our aiWARE platform is available through multiple deployment options, including a fully cloud-based option on both commercial and secure government cloud instances, and a hybrid on-premises/cloud option.  We are continuing to enhance the platform’s architecture to allow for greater portability of the platform and flexibility to deploy it in virtually any environment, including private and additional public cloud environments and on-premises. 
 aiWARE is currently deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS)’ commercial cloud in the United States and in the United Kingdom.  We also offer a secure, government cloud deployment of our platform within AWS’ secure government cloud, and are currently deploying our platform in Microsoft Azure’s secure government cloud, to support government and public safety related customers. In March 2019, we received an Authority to Operate (“ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) for our government cloud-based platform.  
 5

Our hybrid on-premises/cloud version of aiWARE allows users to conduct cognitive processing using certain engines on a network-isolated basis behind the user’s firewall, so that only the metadata produced by those engines needs to be moved outside of the user’s network. Users may elect to conduct processing utilizing additional cloud-based engines and to utilize our cloud-based suite of applications to search and analyze the results. This version of aiWARE is ideal for users who want their original content to remain on their network for security or transmission cost reasons.   
 We intend to continue to enhance the portability of aiWARE in order to provide substantially all of the features and functionality of the platform within any environment to meet customers’ needs.
 Digital Asset Management Solutions
 Through our acquisition of Wazee Digital, we have expanded our offerings to include digital asset management solutions.  We have integrated the AI-powered cognitive capabilities of aiWARE into these solutions to enable customers to enrich and enhance the value of their content and expand their revenue opportunities.

Target Markets 
 As the volume of data being created and collected continues to explode, we believe that AI technology will play an increasingly larger role in solving some of the world’s most complicated challenges.  We have identified numerous ways in which our aiWARE platform and related AI technology may be used to extract valuable insights from large volumes of data to solve real-world problems across a broad range of markets.  We are focused initially on the needs of customers in the media and entertainment, legal and compliance and government markets.  We intend to leverage the capabilities that we have developed for these key markets to expand into other markets in the future.
Media and Entertainment 
 We license our aiWARE solutions to leading media companies, including national radio and television broadcasters, major studios, networks and sports organizations.  These customers are leveraging our AI technologies to unlock value from their content, drive revenue and gain operational efficiencies in their businesses.
 Our aiWARE platform, including our Essentials and Attribute applications, enable radio and television broadcasters to provide advertisers with near real-time insights and analytics into their advertising campaigns.  aiWARE transforms the way these media broadcasters conduct their business by implementing AI-powered applications in their ad tracking and verification workflows, enabling them to provide near real-time ad verification and integrated audience analytics.  Our Attribute application delivers additional analytics by correlating pre-recorded, native, and organic mentions in a broadcaster’s programming with an advertiser’s website traffic data.  aiWARE empowers broadcaster sales representatives and campaign managers to demonstrate an advertiser’s campaign effectiveness and reveal data-driven insights for optimization of ad placements to drive greater customer ROI, helping to drive increases in customer advertising spending.

Our aiWARE-enabled Core and Digital Media Hub offerings are used by leading media owners and broadcasters to manage, enrich and monetize their content.  Some of the world’s largest content owners rely on these products to store, manage, search, discover and distribute petabytes of content.  Media owners and broadcasters are leveraging aiWARE to enhance their post-production and media archive retrieval workflows.  Utilizing the aiWARE Essentials applications, these customers are able ingest their live and archived media into aiWARE and run an array of cognitive engines on the media to identify keywords, faces, logos and objects, enriching the content with additional metadata to allow it to be quickly and easily searched, analyzed, curated and shared in near real-time.  aiWARE can be integrated with existing digital asset management systems through our robust APIs, allowing customers to benefit from AI-powered search capabilities within their digital asset management systems.  
 We have developed workflows to address certain critical use cases for media and entertainment customers, to enable them to leverage the power of aiWARE to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.  For example, we have developed a solution that enables broadcasters to automate their compliance with the Children’s Television Act, which prohibits the use of the program talent or other identifiers within a children’s program in commercials during that program. The solution automates what is currently a difficult, labor-intensive and costly process, helping them to improve the accuracy of their compliance efforts while reducing the time and costs required. 
 We also ingest and process publicly available media in aiWARE to enable such media to be searched and analyzed.  We license access to this public media index to media and other customers, including political organizations such as campaigns, political consultants, elected officials, committees, political action committees, or PACs, Super PACs and special interest groups.  Our public media index allows these political organizations to analyze public media, conduct research and provide access to previously inaccessible data, enabling them to quickly identify a candidate’s positions on key issues, identify flip-flopping or inconsistencies, monitor media coverage of issues and trending topics, and understand local voter sentiment.
 Legal and Compliance 
 Within the Legal market, our AI technologies support eDiscovery, where audio and video content analysis is playing an increasingly important role in litigation. The eDiscovery segment includes a broad range of software and managed service providers with strong existing capabilities for identifying, collecting and producing electronically stored information primarily from text-based documents, including email. Historically, eDiscovery processing has disregarded audio and video files due to the high cost and complexity involved in automatically identifying relevant keywords, phrases or other details contained therein. Today, legal professionals must deal with escalating volumes of audio and video content resulting from recorded telephone calls, voice mails, video recordings and other sources. 
 The cognitive capabilities of aiWARE enable professionals to quickly search and analyze audio, video and structured data to identify particular words, phrases, sentiments and voices at a fraction of the cost of other legal eDiscovery solutions. We have integrated our platform with Relativity, an industry leading eDiscovery software platform, enabling Relativity users to leverage our AI capabilities to perform large-scale, automated analytics of audio and video files within the Relativity environment as part of their e-discovery efforts.  Our platform can also be integrated with other eDiscovery solutions through our open APIs to meet customers’ needs.  We are also developing an application to provide customers with an effective way to rapidly ingest, process and search large volumes of audio, video, image and text-based documents to identify and segregate relevant evidence for further review and analysis.  We have entered into agreements with major providers of eDiscovery services and solutions and multinational law firms, pursuant to which they are using our platform to analyze the vast amounts of audio and video data evidence in current litigation, which was previously too expensive to access and use effectively.  
 We have also identified a need of customers in a broad range of industries, such as the financial services, insurance, healthcare and other highly-regulated industries, to utilize AI technology to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of their compliance efforts. For example, our aiWARE platform could be leveraged by users in these industries to monitor electronic communications such as recorded telephone calls and e-mails, together with trading data, to identify compliance issues such as improper securities or financial product sales practices or off-label marketing of pharmaceuticals, in near real time. We are currently developing a compliance application to enable these customers to use aiWARE to monitor a wide range of electronic communications, together with trading data, with a correlation engine to identify potential compliance issues and route the data to compliance personnel via preconfigured workflows.  We are currently pursuing opportunities with major financial institutions, and outsourced call monitoring providers serving these customers, which would use our platform to process monitored audio recordings to identify regulatory or policy violations or other suspicious behavior.

Government 
 Our aiWARE platform enables law enforcement agencies and other government authorities to organize and gain insight from the large amount of audio, video and structured data they accumulate on a daily basis, including from police body cameras, police car recorders, interview room cameras, 911 audio tapes, surveillance cameras and a variety of other digital media technologies. As the volume of video data collected has grown enormously in recent years, so has the challenge of reviewing that data to assist in investigations. In most cases, due to the unstructured nature of this video data, it currently must be reviewed manually, a task that consumes huge amounts of time and causes delays in investigations. As a result, such data largely has not been used other than as back up to protect police and government agencies from potential claims. In addition to the challenges of using the huge volumes of video footage being collected, authorities are also faced with the daunting task of responding to requests for such information from the public. Many states have statutes that require public agencies to provide certain information, including in many cases audio and video files, and several states have passed laws mandating that video content must be stored and accessible for a specified number of months. Reviewing video footage to identify and authenticate the appropriate footage to be disclosed, and to redact faces and other sensitive information from the footage prior to disclosure, are currently time-consuming, largely manual processes. As a result, law enforcement and other public safety agencies are continuing to invest in solutions in this area. 
 We have recently released our IDentify and Redact applications, which are tailored specifically to address the needs in this market.  These applications are currently being used by multiple law enforcement agencies in the United States and United Kingdom under pilot licenses.  
 Other Vertical Markets and Applications
 The open architecture, modularity and power of our aiWARE platform make it easy to scale and adapt our solutions to a variety of other vertical markets without significant cost or integration requirements. We are currently evaluating and/or developing industry-specific solutions for a broad range of customers to enable them to leverage our platform to analyze public and private audio, video and structured data. For example, we are currently adapting aiWARE to allow for integration with security and video management systems to enable use of our AI processing capabilities for customers’ surveillance requirements.  
Sales and Marketing 
 As of February 28, 2019, we had 56 sales and marketing employees. The sales and marketing activities for our aiWARE SaaS solutions and our aiWARE content licensing and media services are focused on driving awareness and increasing brand recognition of our platform, technologies and services across our core vertical markets, gaining new customers and increasing revenue from our existing customers. In our advertising business, we continue to focus our sales efforts on expanding business with our existing advertising clients and gaining new clients. 
 aiWARE SaaS Solutions 
 We conduct sales and marketing activities related to our aiWARE SaaS solutions through a combination of our direct sales force and indirect channel partners such as value-added resellers (“VARs”), distributors, system integrators, managed services providers and referral partners.  Our direct sales organization is comprised of teams of account executives and sales managers, who are supported by sales development representatives, sales engineers and other inside sales and customer support personnel, currently located in the United States and the United Kingdom. These sales teams are generally organized based on their specialized knowledge and expertise within each of our target markets. We also have business development managers who are focused on identifying, developing and managing our relationships with strategic accounts, including technology and go-to-market partners and enterprise customers, across all of our target markets. Our sales team collaborates closely with our product management, product development and data science teams to evaluate and develop solutions to address the needs of customers. 
 We have also established, and we intend to continue to expand, an indirect sales channel comprised of VARs, distributors and referral partners. We have entered into agreements with channel partners located in the United States and internationally. These agreements generally provide the channel partners with discounts below our standard prices for platform licenses, processing and other services, have terms of one year which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period. Substantially all of our agreements with channel partners are nonexclusive; however, we allow channel partners to register sales opportunities through our deal registration program, in which case we may grant a channel partner priority to pursue an opportunity for a specified period of time, subject to certain conditions.

We intend to expand our direct and indirect sales channels in the United States and internationally in order to aggressively pursue wider recognition for our technology and capabilities, and to drive greater market penetration in our key target markets.
 From a marketing perspective, we are focused on increasing our brand name recognition within each of our target markets. Our marketing efforts include comprehensive multi-channel campaign strategy and execution, new product introduction education and sales enablement programs as well as thought leadership programs including press and analyst relations designed to reach both market influencers and the media. 
 aiWARE Content Licensing Services
 We conduct sales and marketing activities relating to our digital content licensing services business through our direct sales force, which is comprised of representatives located in New York, Los Angeles and Denver who identify, develop and manage our relationships with strategic customers in the advertising, entertainment/documentary and network broadcasting industries. We maintain our Commerce web portal, where stock content and select libraries can be licensed and downloaded directly, but the majority of our business is driven through high-value libraries that require an approval process in order to gain access. We also cross-sell additional Veritone products and services, including media management and aiWARE, to our content licensor partners.  
Advertising 
 We market and sell our advertising services through a combination of our direct sales and indirect channel sales. We primarily market and sell directly to advertisers through outbound sales networking and client and partner referrals. Our indirect sales channel consists of referral partners who are mainly advertising agencies or marketing consultants who are unable to provide certain services to their clients, such as radio, podcast and YouTube placements. In addition to our sales efforts for new clients, we further expand sales opportunities and upsell through our campaign strategists who work directly with our advertising clients to optimize and enhance media spending on advertising campaigns. We plan to continue to expand our domestic sales footprint through the addition of direct sales representatives and campaign strategists. 
Customers 
 We market and sell our aiWARE SaaS solutions to customers primarily in the media and entertainment, legal and compliance and government markets.  To date, we have generated most of our revenues from customers in the media and entertainment market.  During 2018, ten customers accounted for approximately 84.4% of the total revenues from our aiWARE SaaS solutions, of which two national radio broadcasting customers accounted for approximately 44.8% of our total revenues from these solutions.  As we grow our revenues from our aiWARE SaaS solutions, both within the media and entertainment market and across our other vertical markets, we believe that our dependence on any single customer or group of customers will be minimized.  
 In our advertising business, we target clients that make significant investments in advertising, particularly in native and spot-based advertising campaigns delivered over broadcast radio, satellite audio, streaming audio, digital video services and other social media channels and podcasting. During 2018, ten advertising clients accounted for approximately 52.2% of the total revenues from our advertising business.  We have continued to grow and diversify our advertising client base over the past two years, which has significantly reduced our dependency on a limited number of large clients.  
 No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues in 2018.
 We believe that our relationships with our key customers are good. However, if our key customers discontinue or reduce their business with us, or suffer downturns in their businesses, it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short-term basis. If we lose business from key customers and we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business, it would have a long-term negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Competition 
 The market for AI-enabled solutions is rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with new capabilities and solutions introduced by both large established players such as IBM, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce seeking to harness the power of AI across multiple vertical markets or enterprise functions, as well as smaller emerging companies developing point solutions that generally only address a single cognitive category or a specific industry segment.

aiWARE SaaS Business. We believe the following competitive attributes are necessary for our aiWARE SaaS business to successfully compete in the AI industry for corporate, institutional and government customers: 
  
• | Applications to enable the platform to be effectively leveraged for a wide variety of use cases;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to seamlessly utilize multiple cognitive engines in the same and different classes;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Breadth and depth of cognitive capabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Performance of cognitive engines, particularly accuracy and speed;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Availability of cloud-based and on-premises deployment models and functionality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ease of deployment and integration;
--+------------------------------------


• | Platform scalability, reliability and security;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to deploy state-of-the art AI capabilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Customer support;
--+------------------


• | Strength of sales and marketing efforts; and
--+---------------------------------------------


• | Cost of deploying and using our products.
--+------------------------------------------

 We believe that we compete favorably on the basis of the factors listed above. We believe that few of our competitors currently compete directly with us across all of our cognitive capabilities and vertical markets, and that none of our competitors currently deploy an AI operating system with an open ecosystem comprised of a comparable number of multiple third party cognitive engines that can be accessed by customers from a single integrated platform. 
 Our competitors fall into five primary categories: 
  
• | Infrastructure-based cloud computing vendors offering cognitive APIs, such as IBM Watson via Bluemix, Microsoft Cognitive Services via Azure and Amazon Machine Learning via AWS; typically, these solutions provide raw computing and storage solutions in conjunction with cognitive categories such as translation, transcription and object detection from which customers can build their own solutions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large established media services companies with global advertising reach that are also deploying new media analytics technologies to best service the needs of major brands; these include the major ad agencies and their affiliates;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Smaller AI-focused vendors offering solutions within a single cognitive category such as Clarifai (object detection), VoiceBase (natural language processing) or Gracenote (audio fingerprinting);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data management and/or analytics vendors that offer solutions that recognize patterns, anomalies, and correlations from customer datasets, such as Alpine Data Labs, Alteryx, Angoss Software, Dell, FICO, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and SAS;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | System integrators that aggregate and integrate solutions from multiple underlying providers of cognitive services for clients, such as Accenture and Deloitte Consulting; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | SaaS software providers focused on a particular industry segment, such as eDiscovery, digital asset management or law enforcement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Many of the same potential competitors listed above participate in our AI ecosystem, enabling their services to be accessed by our customers through our platform. For example, we leverage cloud computing solutions and storage from Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure, and also deploy and integrate cognitive engines from such vendors as IBM, Google, Microsoft, VoiceBase and Clarifai. Further, within our target vertical markets, we are collaborating with companies within the above categories, such as platform providers within eDiscovery. 
 Advertising Business. Competitors of our advertising services are mainly traditional advertising agencies that are either large full-service agencies or smaller niche agencies with a particular specialization or focus, such as radio media placement or podcast advertising. We believe that we currently are, and will continue to, compete successfully against our competitors on several key factors. We are a leader in endorsed radio and podcast advertising services and expect to be able to command more of our clients’ advertising budgets as we expand our media services further within digital and television. In addition, we leverage our platform to provide our clients with innovative technology that we believe provides them with better analytics and insights into their advertising campaigns than our competitors for better advertising performance and optimization. Lastly, due to our reputation and strength within the industry, we have exclusive relationships with most of our advertising clients for audio related media placement.

Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets and larger intellectual property portfolios. As a result, certain of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. In addition, some competitors may offer products or services that address one or a limited number of functions at lower prices, with greater depth than our products or geographies where we do not operate. With the introduction of new products and services and new market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Moreover, as we expand the scope of our platform, we may face additional competition. 
 Research and Development 
 As of February 28, 2019, our research and development organization consisted of 93 employees, who are responsible for the design, development and testing of our AI and software solutions. The team is comprised of dedicated research employees, software engineers, quality engineers, data scientists, data engineers, site operations engineers, mobile app developers, product managers and user experience designers. We focus our efforts on developing new features and expanding the core technologies that further enhance the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of our platform, as well as allow us to operate in new vertical markets. In addition, we contract with select third-party engineering services to support development and quality assurance testing.  We plan to continue to make significant investments in developing our AI technologies, expanding the functionality and capabilities of our aiWARE platform, and building new software capabilities. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
 As of February 28, 2019, in the United States, we had 22 issued patents, which expire between 2027 and 2036, and had 39 patent applications pending for examination. As of such date, we also had 12 issued patents and 48 patent applications pending for examination in foreign jurisdictions (including international PCT applications), all of which are related to our U.S. patents and patent applications. In addition, as of February 28, 2019, in the United States, we had 30 registered trademarks and pending applications to register nine additional marks. As of such date, we also had 29 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions and five pending trademarks.  We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by implementing a policy that requires our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, companies in the communications and technology industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We may face allegations in the future that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. 
 Regulatory Environment 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.

Our customers utilize our aiWARE SaaS solutions and related services to process, analyze and store data, which may contain personal information that is subject to data protection and privacy laws in various jurisdictions.  For example, in providing certain solutions and related services to customers located in the Europe, we are deemed to be a data processor under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).  The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for non-compliance, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and extends the scope of the EU data protection to all companies processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of the company’s location.  As a result, we are obligated to comply with the GDPR in processing personal data on behalf of our customers.  We are also obligated to comply with the GDPR as a data controller with respect to personal data of certain employees and individuals employed or engaged by our customers, vendors and service providers, which we receive and process in the course of our business.  Data protection regulations similar to the GDPR have been implemented in other jurisdictions, including in California and other states within the United States.
 Employees 
 As of February 28, 2019, we had a total of 325 employees, of which 317 were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
