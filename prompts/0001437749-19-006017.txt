ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 
NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a medical device company predominately focused on eye care. We are currently focused primarily on commercializing Avenova®, a prescription product sold in the United States for cleansing and removing foreign material including microorganisms and debris from skin around the eye, including the eyelid.
 
Avenova is an eye care product formulated with our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid. Avenova has proven in laboratory testing to have broad antimicrobial properties as a preservative in solution as it removes foreign material including microorganisms and debris from the skin on the eyelids and lashes without burning or stinging.
 
Our overall business strategy remains the same since November 2015, when we restructured our business to focus our resources on growing sales of Avenova in the United States. However, the Company recently announced a refocus to strategically shift its commercialization strategy to focus on high performing territories and territories identified as having significant prescription volume potential along with favorable health plan coverage while continuing to focus on contracting with additional mail-order pharmacies as channel partners. Our current three-part business strategy is comprised of: (1) focusing our resources on growing the U.S. commercial sales of Avenova, including implementation of a new sales and marketing strategy intended to increase product margin and profitability; (2) maintaining low expenses and continuing to optimize sales force efficiency, including strategic geographical reach and efforts directed to maintain and increase insurance reimbursement for Avenova; and (3) seeking additional sources of revenue through partnering, divesting and/or other means of monetizing non-core assets in urology, dermatology, and wound care.
 
Pursuant to our business strategy, we have developed additional products containing our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid, including NeutroPhase® for the wound care market and CelleRx® for the dermatology market. Since the launch of NeutroPhase in 2013, we have established U.S. distribution partners and an international distribution partner in China. We currently do not sell or distribute CelleRx, although we are looking into several distribution possibilities.
 
Avenova, NeutroPhase, and CelleRx are medical devices cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") under the Food and Drug Administration Act Section 510(k). The products are intended for use under the supervision of healthcare professionals for the cleansing and removal of foreign material, including microorganisms and debris. For wound treatment, NeutroPhase® is also intended for use under the supervision of healthcare professionals for moistening absorbent wound dressings and cleansing minor cuts, minor burns, superficial abrasions and minor irritations of the skin. It is also intended for moistening and debriding acute and chronic dermal lesions.
 
Avenova
 
Prescription Avenova is a proprietary solution with hypochlorous acid that acts as an antimicrobial preservative in solution and has been shown to neutralize bacterial toxins in laboratory tests. Because it is a gentle isotonic solution, we believe that it is well suited for daily eyelid hygiene. We have received approximately 700,000 new prescriptions or reorders for Avenova since the launch of the product in 2014. We believe that Avenova offers distinct advantages, when compared to alternative regimens that contain soaps, bleach, and other impurities, as it removes unwanted microorganisms from the skin without the use of harmful ingredients such as detergents and bleach.

We currently believe our target market to be the millions of Americans who suffer from minor irritation of the skin around the eye (commonly referred to as blepharitis), making it prudent to utilize a cleanser with the advantages of Avenova. To access our target market, our salesforce is calling on a base of prescribers that includes the approximately 18,000 ophthalmologists and approximately 40,000 optometrists in the U.S. Our sales and marketing campaign targets major urban areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco.
 
We began selling Avenova in the United States in 2014. Since then, we have consistently reported increases in key metrics, including the total number of prescribers, as well as growth in prescription volume as reported by distributors and the number of retail pharmacies ordering Avenova (both of which have been confirmed by third-party prescription data providers). We have distribution agreements with McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen Corporation that make Avenova accessible nationwide in nearly all retail pharmacies across the United States, and we have entered into certain agreements directly with some preferred pharmacy networks. These agreements with partner pharmacies give us greater control over the patient experience and ensure patients obtain the product at the best possible price. Avenova is also marketed through numerous ophthalmology and optometry networks, including some specialty pharmacy groups that specialize in obtaining patient refills and maintaining patient compliance.
 
Based on consistent positive sales performance, we incrementally grew our salesforce to approximately 50 medical sales representatives in 2016 and maintained a similar number throughout 2017 and 2018, although we recently decreased this number to 15 high-performing field sales representatives at the end of the first quarter of 2019 to conserve cash.
 
We expect that our prescription business will continue to be an important part of total Avenova sales.  Although we are seeking new distribution channels, we continue to focus our primary sales efforts on building our prescription business under a value pricing model. We maintain a rebate program for electronic payment transactions and in the form of instant rebate cards. The rebate cards are intended to be used by patients who either do not have insurance coverage or whose insurance coverage does not cover Avenova, thereby lowering the price for the patient at the pharmacy. Our partner pharmacies ensure that proper insurance reimbursement occurs, and that our patients are receiving the best possible price.
 
We also expect to invest in systems that support prescribing physicians' efforts to educate their patients. We believe we have made it easier for doctors to get Avenova into the hands of patients by providing availability through well-known national pharmacy chains, partner pharmacies, or directly through the practitioners' office.
 
Certain key opinion leaders in the field of ophthalmology and optometry have embraced Avenova as a tool for cleansing and removing foreign material including microorganisms and debris from skin like the eyelid, and they have joined our Ophthalmic and Optometry Advisory Boards (the "Advisory Boards") to promote its use among their peers. We have entered into written agreements with these key opinion leaders for their services, which include equity awards.
 
Competitors for Avenova 
 
There are many companies that sell lid and lash scrubs, most of which, to the best of our knowledge, are surfactant (soap) based. Unlike its competitors, Avenova consists solely of saline and 0.01% pure hypochlorous acid, without the bleach impurities included in competitive offerings. While newer over-the-counter products have recently been commercially launched, they all include bleach or other impurities. Because it lacks these impurities, we believe that physicians and their patients will choose Avenova over other competitive prescription products or over-the-counter soap products. While antibacterial soaps are commonly used to reduce or prevent bacterial contamination on the skin, we do not view them as effective competitors of Avenova.
Strategic Alternatives and Other Assets
 
In addition to our hypochlorous acid family of products, we have synthesized and developed a second category of novel compounds also aimed at addressing the global, topical anti-infective markets. We are also in the process of seeking additional sources of revenue by licensing or selling select non-core assets in urology, dermatology and wound care, as described in more detail below.
Aganocide Compounds
 
This second product category includes auriclosene, our lead clinical-stage Aganocide compound, which is a patented, synthetic molecule with a broad spectrum of uses against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Our Aganocide compound is a derivative of the naturally occurring dichlorotaurine, mimicking the anti-infective chemistry and mechanism of action that human white blood cells, known as leukocytes, use against infections. Our Aganocide compound possesses a significantly reduced likelihood of bacteria or viruses developing resistance, which is critical for advanced anti-infectives. The World Health Organization has issued the international nonproprietary name ("INN") "auriclosene" for our lead Aganocide® compound NVC-422. Each INN is a globally recognized unique name, and we believe INNs facilitate the identification of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Auriclosene is a novel chemical entity and was granted composition of matter patent protection to 2024 by the U.S. Patent Office. Although we conducted clinical trials using the Aganocide compounds from 2007 to 2015, none have received FDA approval, and we therefore cannot commercialize these compounds in the United States.

AIS (Urology) 

Our urology program utilizes the technology of our Aganocide compounds and is in an advanced stage of clinical development. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful results have been reported from two Phase 2 clinical studies with our Auriclosene Irrigation Solution ("AIS") in urinary catheter blockage and encrustation ("UCBE"). We announced the results of a Phase 2b clinical study in September 2016 which demonstrated that AIS, when compared to a sodium citrate buffer, proved more effective in reducing urinary blockage in patients with chronic indwelling urinary catheters who have repeat history of blockage. This study enrolled a population of 36 chronically catheterized patients with spinal cord injury and other neurological disorders. The primary efficacy endpoint comparing percent flow rate reduction of AIS-treated catheters to buffer-treated catheters was achieved with statistical significance (p values < 0.05). The clinical efficacy endpoint was also achieved with statistical significance, with no blockage in subjects in the AIS arm versus clinical blockage in 28% of the subjects treated with vehicle. No serious adverse events were reported, and overall tolerability was considered good. This program will require a partner willing to invest in phase 3 clinical studies in order to move this program forward and seek FDA approval.
 
intelli-Case 
 
While a majority of the approximately 40 million contact lens wearers in the United States disinfect their contact lenses with a multipurpose disinfection system to prevent potentially serious infections, we estimate that approximately 12% of the contact lens wearers use hydrogen peroxide as a disinfection solution. Many ophthalmologists and optometrists are known to favor the use of hydrogen peroxide for its disinfection ability and lens material compatibility, yet, to the best of our knowledge, side effects associated with misuse and non-compliance discourage peroxide system use. For example, hydrogen peroxide in too low of a concentration does not fully disinfect lenses and in too high of a concentration can severely irritate the eye.
 
We have developed a contact lens case that improves the safety of those contact lens wearers who use hydrogen peroxide solution to disinfect their lenses. In June 2015, we received FDA-clearance for the intelli-Case, an easy-to-use device for use with hydrogen peroxide disinfection solutions for soft and rigid gas permeable contact lenses. The intelli-Case monitors the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide during the disinfection cycle with sophisticated microprocessor electronics embedded in the cap of what otherwise looks like a standard peroxide lens case. The LED indicators on the case inform the user if the lenses are safe to insert into the eyes, resulting in a disinfection system that is safe yet simple to use.
 
We have paused all development work on intelli-Case until we find an outside partner with the resources to make this device broadly available in the market.
 
CelleRx (Dermatology)
 
Created for cosmetic procedures, CelleRx (0.015% hypochlorous acid as a preservative in solution) is a cleansing solution intended for use after laser resurfacing, chemical peels and other cosmetic surgery procedures. We believe that CelleRx is superior to Dakin solution, which contains bleach impurities.
 
Because our main focus is on Avenova and the eyecare market, we currently do not sell or distribute CelleRx. Initial proof of concept studies have shown promising results, and we may begin to explore market opportunities for this product in the coming year.
 
NeutroPhase (Wound Care)
 
Consisting of 0.03% hypochlorous acid, NeutroPhase is used to cleanse and remove microorganisms from any type of acute or chronic wound, and can be used with any type of wound care modality.
 
NeutroPhase is intended to treat the millions of patients in the United States who suffer from chronic non-healing wounds, such as pressure, venous stasis and diabetic ulcers. NeutroPhase is used by some physicians as an irrigation solution as part of the adjunct treatment for Necrotizing Fasciitis ("NF").
 
NeutroPhase is competing in a crowded wound cleanser market with many older and lower-priced products with similar uses, such as Vashe and Betadine Surgical Scrub. However, we believe NeutroPhase has distinct competitive advantages in a market where there is currently no dominant product. NeutroPhase is distributed through commercial partners in the United States and China.

Customers, Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Our salesforce calls on primarily ophthalmologists, optometrists, and other eye care professionals who can prescribe Avenova. There are currently approximately 10,000 doctors prescribing Avenova in the United States. These doctors have written over 180,000 prescriptions in the United States for Avenova in 2018. Although the number of prescribing physicians who write more than 10 scripts per month has risen dramatically, no individual doctor represented in excess of 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 
We currently outsource manufacturing of all our products to two contract manufacturers with facilities located in the United States. We believe that our contract manufacturers have adequate manufacturing capacity to satisfy our demands and that additional contract manufacturers are also available should they be required.
 
All raw materials and other supplies utilized in the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturers are available from various third-party suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by a variety of means, including obtaining patents, maintaining trade secrets and proprietary know-how and technological innovation to operate, without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. In order to maintain our trade secrets, we have entered into confidentiality/invention rights agreements with all our employees and confidentiality agreements with our contract manufacturers.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 100 issued patents worldwide. Our issued patents are within two patent families: Neutrox hypochlorous acid and Aganocide compounds. The Neutrox hypochlorous acid patents underlay our Avenova products, which is our primary business. Within our Neutrox hypochlorous acid patent family, we own two issued U.S. patents and eight issued foreign patents. The Aganocide compound patent family underlay products that are still in clinical stages, which we are not currently developing and are instead focused almost exclusively on Avenova. Within our Aganocide compound patent family, we own eight issued U.S. patents and 81 issued foreign patents.
Research and Development
 
For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Pursuant to our business strategy focusing our resources on growing the commercial sales of Avenova and maintaining low expenses, we are currently not conducting any substantive research and development. Any substantial research and development costs incurred in the future would be related to our urology program, which we do not expect to move forward without outside investment.
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive government regulation, principally by the FDA and state and local authorities in the United States and by comparable agencies in foreign countries. Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical and medical device products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and under comparable laws by the states and in most foreign countries. We also hold our CE Mark and ISO 13485 certifications. To maintain these certifications, we undergo significant quality control audits with the relevant European authorities every year.
 
FDA Approval/Clearance Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must receive 510(k) clearance. It has been the Company's experience thus far that the FDA's 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months, but can last significantly longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market. We have obtained the required FDA clearance for all of our current products that require such clearance.
 
The FDA decides whether a device line must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval ("PMA"). PMA is the FDA process of scientific and regulatory review to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The PMA process is based on statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification ("PMN") requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The PMN must demonstrate that the proposed device is "substantially equivalent" in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device, which is a pre-existing medical device to which equivalence can be drawn, that is either in Class I, Class II, or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA's general regulatory controls for medical devices, or the "General Controls", which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's quality system regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) PMN process described below. Avenova is classified as a Class I device.
 
Class II devices are subject to the FDA's General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) PMN procedure. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, or MDUFMA, as of October 2002 unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) PMN submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process. intelli-Case is classified as a Class II device.
 
Class III devices are those devices which have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the PMA process described below. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees under MDUFMA than are 510(k) PMNs. None of our products are Class III devices.
 
A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites.
 
Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
 
A host of regulatory requirements apply to our marketed devices, including the quality system regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), the Medical Reporting Regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA specified types of adverse events involving their products), labeling regulations, and the FDA's general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or "off-label" uses. Class II devices also can have special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidelines that do not apply to Class I devices. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new cGMP requirements could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Health Care Fraud and Abuse
 
In the United States, there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b)) prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program (including Medicare and Medicaid). Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the Office of Inspector General within the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued regulations, known as the safe harbors, which identify permissible practices. If all of the requirements of an applicable safe harbor are met, an arrangement will not be prosecuted under this law. Safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, payments to bona fide employees, certain discount arrangements, and certain payment arrangements involving GPOs. The failure of an arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal. However, conduct that does not fully satisfy each requirement of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG or the Department of Justice. Violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment, monetary fines and assessments, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Law, many states have their own kickback laws. Often, these state laws closely follow the language of the federal law. Some state anti-kickback laws apply regardless of whether a federal health care program payment is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and relationships with health care providers or pharmacies by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with them.

Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payors that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq.) imposes liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program (including Medicaid and Medicare). Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, and imprisonment.
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created certain criminal statutes relating to health care, including health care fraud and false statements related to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among others, knowingly and willingly executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to monitor and report certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, for disclosure to the public. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians for marketing, medical directorships, and other purposes. Some states mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, and some states limit or prohibit such gifts.
 
Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians. Our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Foreign Regulation
 
Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the requirements may differ.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
Customers that are prescribed our product generally rely on third-party payors, such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of our product. As a result, demand for our product is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors.
 
Private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that private third-party payors will cover and reimburse our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. Most importantly, we have received notices from several national payors that Avenova will not be covered in 2019. Currently, none of our products are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and we do not anticipate that they will be reimbursed by such programs in the future.
 
CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, frequently changes product descriptors, coverage policies, product and service codes, payment methodologies and reimbursement values. Private payors often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of Medicare. We cannot assure you that private third-party payors will cover and reimburse our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. Further, in the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to lower expenditures for medical products and services, which may adversely affect reimbursement for our products. 
 
Other U.S. Regulation
 
We must also comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, healthcare reform, patient privacy and information, fire hazard control and, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 70 employees, all of whom were full-time employees. After the reduction in force in March 2019, the Company currently has 33 employees, half of which are field sales representatives dedicated solely to the sale of Avenova. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Facilities
 
Our principal executive office and administrative operations are located in Emeryville, California. On August 24, 2016, we entered into an Office Lease (the "Lease"), pursuant to which we leased approximately 7,799 rentable square feet of real property located on the eleventh floor (Suite 1150) at 2000 Powell Street, Emeryville, California 94608 from KBSIII Towers at Emeryville, LLC (the "Landlord"), for our new principal executive offices. The expiration date of the Lease is February 28, 2022, unless earlier terminated pursuant to any provision of the Lease. The Company has the option to extend the term of the Lease for one five (5)-year period upon written notice to the Landlord due no earlier than twelve (12) months and no later than nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Lease. We believe that our office and administration facilities are suitable and adequate for our current operations, but we may require additional space and facilities as our business expands.
 
The Company still has a lease commitment for the laboratory facilities and office space at Suite 550, EmeryStation North Building, 5980 Horton Street, Emeryville, California ("EmeryStation") under an operating lease which will expire on October 31, 2020. On July 11, 2016, the Company entered into a Sublease Agreement to sublease all 16,465 rentable square feet of real property at EmeryStation (the "Sublease Agreement"). The commencement date under the Sublease Agreement was September 8, 2016. The expiration date of the Sublease Agreement is October 21, 2020, as amended (while the expiration date of the Company's master lease for the EmeryStation premises is October 31, 2020), unless earlier terminated pursuant to the Company terminating its master lease for EmeryStation or the Sublease Agreement.
 
Borrowings
 
In February 2019, in connection with a $1.0 million loan to the Company facilitated by China Kington (the "February 2019 Loan"), we issued a promissory note payable to Pioneer Pharma (Hong Kong) Company Limited ("Pioneer Hong Kong"), which has a perfected security interest in all tangible and intangible assets of the Company. The February 2019 Loan includes an interest payment of $150,000 which along with the entire principal sum is payable in full upon our next financing with Pioneer Hong Kong, but in no event later than July 27, 2019. In connection with the February 2019 Loan, the Company must pay China Kington a 2% fee for brokering the transaction and enter into a consulting agreement with China Kington for the term of one year to facilitate closer oversight of the Company's expenses and strategic direction by the Board of Directors. Bob Wu, acting in a dual role as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors and as principal of China Kington, will be paid $100,000 pursuant to this consulting agreement.
 
In January 2016, in connection with a bridge loan (the "Bridge Loan") facilitated by China Kington, we issued five (5) promissory notes to certain lenders between December 2015 and January 2016 for an aggregate amount of $3.0 million.
 
After the closing of the first tranche of the April 2016 Financing (as defined below), in May 2016, we used $2.5 million of the proceeds to repay the principal on the promissory notes outstanding under the $3.0 million Bridge Loan.
 
After the closing of the second tranche of the April 2016 Financing, in August 2016 we repaid the final $0.5 million outstanding under the Bridge Loan and all liens on our property and assets associated with the Bridge Loan were released.
 
Recent Events 
 
See the above description under "Borrowings" regarding our loan from Pioneer Hong Kong.
 
Triton Funds LP Term Sheet
 
On March 25, 2019, the Company entered into a Term Sheet (the “Term Sheet”) with Triton Funds LP, a Delaware company (“Triton”). Pursuant to the Term Sheet, upon the transaction closing, Triton will have the right to purchase shares of common stock of the Company up to a value of $3,000,000 (the “Shares”) at a purchase price equal to 90% of the lowest trading price of the Company’s common stock for the five business days prior to the closing date. In addition, the Term Sheet requires a donation of 150,000 shares of common stock to Triton Funds LLC (the “Donation Shares”) and a document preparation fee of $15,000. The Term Sheet also requires that a Form S-3 be filed by April 1, 2019 to register the Shares and Donation Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
Securities Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note
 
On March 26, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Iliad Research and Trading, L.P. (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Company issued a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “Convertible Note”) to the Lender dated as of the Closing Date. The Convertible Note has an original principal amount of $2,215,000, bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum and will mature on September 26, 2020, unless earlier paid, redeemed or converted in accordance with its terms. The Company received proceeds of $2,000,000 after an original issue discount and payment of Lender’s legal fees.
 
 7



The Convertible Note provides the Lender with the right to convert, at any time, all or any part of the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.65 per share (“Lender Conversion Price”) or the Market Price. The Market Price is defined as 85% of the lowest closing bid price during the twenty (20) Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable measurement date.
 
Pursuant to a Security Agreement between the Company and the Lender, repayment of the Convertible Note is secured by all of the assets of the Company.
