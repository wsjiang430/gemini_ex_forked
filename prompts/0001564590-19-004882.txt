 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing to treat atrial fibrillation, or AF, in certain patients who also have heart failure, or HF.  
 Gencaro has a mechanism of action that we believe is unique in the beta-blocker drug class and is modulated by a specific genotype. We estimate this genotype is present in about 50% of North American and European general populations. We believe that Gencaro’s potential efficacy is enhanced in treating patients who have this genotype and, if Gencaro is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, Gencaro could potentially be a safe and effective therapy for treating AF in patients who have HF. We also believe that Gencaro, if approved, will have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets.

In February 2018, we reported the results of our Phase 2B clinical trial, known as GENETIC-AF, in which we evaluated Gencaro for the prevention of AF recurrence in patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, < 0.50. This population included 267 patients that had HF with reduced LVEF < 0.40, or HFrEF, or HF with mid-range LVEF ≥ 0.40 and < 0.50, or HFmrEF. GENETIC-AF compared Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. There are no approved or guideline recommended drug therapies for prevention of AF in HFmrEF patients, which constituted approximately one-half of the GENETIC-AF patients. 
In GENETIC-AF, Gencaro was observed to have a similar treatment effect to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) in the overall population for prevention of AF recurrence. However, additional analyses prespecified in the statistical analysis plan showed statistically significant treatment effects in favor of Gencaro in the majority of the Phase 2B population (N=196; HR=0.54; p = 0.011). Gencaro also showed statistically significant treatment effects compared to TOPROL-XL for the prevention of AF recurrence in a subset of these patients with HFmrEF (N=91; HR=0.42; p = 0.017). We plan to conduct a pivotal Phase 3 trial, known as PRECISION-AF, evaluating Gencaro in HFmrEF patients because of Gencaro’s observed potential treatment effect in these patients in GENETIC‑AF. 
 The prevalence of AF is higher in HFmrEF patients as compared with HF generally; it is estimated that 30%-60% of HFmrEF patients also have AF. For patients with HF, AF can contribute to the disease processes that lead to the progression of heart failure and worsening clinical outcomes including hospitalizations and death. This increased risk of illness and death when AF is present with heart failure is true across the spectrum of HF, including HFmrEF. Given these risks and the absence of HF or AF therapies specifically indicated for the HFmrEF population, we believe there is an unmet medical need for drug therapy with greater efficacy to prevent or delay the development of AF in these patients.
 In February 2019, we received a Special Protocol Assessment agreement, or SPA, from the FDA for our planned Phase 3 clinical program. The FDA’s SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA’s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product’s efficacy and safety. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA evaluates the protocol and responds to a sponsor’s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate for the indication studied. An SPA agreement can potentially reduce the regulatory risk of bringing a drug to market.
Our SPA details a single adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial (PRECISION-AF) designed as a double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, international, study comparing Gencaro with TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the prevention of recurrent AF or all-cause mortality, or ACM, in 

HFmrEF patients. Eligible patients will have HFmrEF, a recent AF event and the genotype which we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the submitted trial will be time to first event of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter or ACM during a 26-week follow-up period. Subject to securing significant additional financing, we anticipate initiating PRECISION-AF in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
 We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safe and more effective therapy than currently available therapeutics for treating heart failure patients with AF. We believe Gencaro has the potential to be unique in several aspects, including:
  
• | The first genetically-targeted cardiovascular therapy;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | The only drug therapy indicated for AF in patients with HFmrEF; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The only therapy for AF approved against an active comparator.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 The genotype that we believe enhances Gencaro’s efficacy can be detected by a genetic test that can be performed by a centralized laboratory or potentially at the point of care during the patient visit. We also believe that Gencaro, if approved, will have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status in the United States, Europe or other markets in which it may be approved.
 
The Proposed Gencaro Phase 3 Clinical Trial
 Based on our GENETIC-AF trial results, as well as results of previous Phase 3 pharmacogenetic substudy data from the Phase 3 heart failure clinical trial of bucindolol, known as the BEST trial, we submitted an SPA to the FDA detailing our proposed Phase 3 clinical trial and potential approval path for Gencaro. In February 2019, we received an SPA agreement for PRECISION-AF, a Phase 3 pivotal study comparing Gencaro against TOPROL-XL for the treatment of AF in HFmrEF patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype.

The PRECISION-AF Phase 3 clinical trial is designed as a double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, international, adaptive study comparing Gencaro with TOPROL-XL for the prevention of recurrent AF/atrial flutter, or AF/AFL, or all-cause mortality, or ACM, in HFmrEF patients. The study will enroll approximately 400 patients at investigative sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Eligible patients will have HFmrEF (LVEF  40 and < 50%), a recent AF event and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype which we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. The planned trial will use standard significance criteria (p < 0.01 with adjustment for interim analysis) for the primary endpoint and will include an interim analysis after a portion of total patients have been enrolled. The interim analysis is designed to assess safety, validate initial study assumptions and maintain adequate statistical power for the primary endpoint. Subject to securing additional financing, we anticipate initiating PRECISION-AF in the fourth quarter of 2019. Any future development of Gencaro, including initiating any Phase 3 clinical trial, is dependent on obtaining significant additional financing, even if we enter into a strategic collaboration around the development of Gencaro.
 
GENETIC-AF and BEST Trial DNA Substudy
 Our planned Phase 3 development program of Gencaro is based on the results from GENETIC-AF and a prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of bucindolol in 2,708 HF patients. Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype.
 GENETIC-AF enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus an active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to recurrent AF/AFL or ACM. Eligible patients had LVEF < 50%, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. A subgroup of patients underwent continuous (24/7) heart rhythm monitoring via implanted loop recorders or other implanted therapeutic devices of Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company, to evaluate daily AF burden, or AFB. A prespecified time-to-first event analysis was conducted using a total AFB of at least 6 hours per day to define an event of AF recurrence.
 Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, TOPROL-XL (hazard ratio of 1.01 [95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.42]). In the U.S. patient cohort of 127 patients (approximately 50% of all patients and events), a trend for benefit in favor of Gencaro over TOPROL-XL was observed (hazard ratio of 0.70, [95% confidence interval: 0.41, 1.19]). The GENETIC-AF results in the United States were consistent with what had been observed in the pharmacogenetic substudy of the BEST heart failure trial, taking into account that BEST was placebo controlled and GENETIC-AF was Gencaro versus an active comparator. However, our analysis also showed significant treatment effects in favor of Gencaro in a majority of patients in the trial, based on factors pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan.
 We believe that the inclusion of a small number of patients in the trial (13.9% of overall population) with long-standing and heavily pretreated HF and AF led to attenuation of the treatment effect estimates for the primary endpoint of GENETIC-AF. Therefore, in accordance with procedures outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan, post-hoc analyses were performed that excluded 37 patients with extraordinarily long durations of HF and AF (subjects who had been diagnosed with HF and/or AF for more than 12 years). In these analyses, we observed a trend for benefit in favor of Gencaro over TOPROL-XL by intermittent, clinic-based heart rhythm monitoring for the entire cohort (230 patients [N=115 for each treatment arm], hazard ratio of 0.68, [95% confidence interval: 0.45, 1.02]) and for the HFmrEF cohort (113 patients, hazard ratio of 0.61, [95% confidence interval: 0.34, 1.10]). The onset of AF relative to the development of HF was also identified in our post-hoc analyses to have a relationship to treatment effect. In these analyses, there was an attenuation of the treatment effect estimates for the primary endpoint in patients who had long-standing AF (i.e., more than 2 years) prior to developing HF. We believe this is due to differences in the underlying pathophysiology for AF patients who eventually develop HF compared to HF patients who subsequently develop AF. Therefore, a post-hoc analysis was performed in the above patient population (N=230) that excluded patients who had developed AF for more than 2 years prior to developing HF. In these analyses, a significant reduction in the GENETIC-AF primary endpoint was observed in the overall population (N=196; HR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.87; p = 0.011) and in the HFmrEF cohort (N=91; HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.86; p = 0.017). Based upon our analysis of the GENETIC-AF data, we believe further clinical development of Gencaro can be successful using entry criteria to identify HFmrEF patients with the characteristics for disease duration and onset described above and outlined in the following table:

Population Subpopulation | Time to AF/AFL/ACM
N | HR (95% CI) | P-value 
All Patients | 267 | 1.01 (0.71, 1.42) | 0.961
HF and AF for less than 12 years | 230 | 0.68 (0.45, 1.02) | 0.064
AF not more than 2 years prior to HF | 196 | 0.54 (0.33, 0.87) | 0.011
HFmrEF | 91 | 0.42 (0.21, 0.86) | 0.017

 Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated, with 84% of patients attaining their target dose compared to 72% of patients receiving TOPROL-XL. The most frequently reported adverse events were similar in both groups and consistent with the known safety profile of the beta-blocker class of drugs. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug by the investigator occurred in 23.8% of patients in the Gencaro group and in 30.1% of patients in the TOPROL-XL group. Of note, adverse events of bradycardia were less frequently reported in the Gencaro group (3.7%) compared to patients receiving TOPROL-XL (12.0%). During the 24-week efficacy follow-up period there were three deaths (ACM) in the TOPROL-XL group and none in the Gencaro group. Three patients died in the long-term treatment extension period after receiving Gencaro for more than a year. 
 We believe data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF in HFrEF patients. A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro’s efficacy (known as the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis. In addition, the BEST study, the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF. Furthermore, patients with a beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 50% of the patients screened and all enrolled patients in the GENETIC-AF trial and 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the North American and European general populations.
 Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro required a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype. Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, developed the genetic test, obtained an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA and provided the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC‑AF trial. We retain all rights to the genetic test. Future clinical trials of Gencaro, if any, are expected to use a similar diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype. 
 Medtronic collaborated with us on the GENETIC-AF trial in supporting our AFB substudy. The collaboration was administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic used its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices. In April 2018, Medtronic and ARCA agreed to extend the current U.S., Canadian and European Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement for an additional year. 
 We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing. If Gencaro is approved, we believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop for up to 10 years after approval in the United States, Europe and other markets, depending on when the drug is approved.  
 
AB171
 AB171 is a thiol-containing derivative of isosorbide mononitrate. Pre-clinical data from human endothelial cells indicate that compared to nitrates in clinical use, AB171 has a genotype specific enhancement of nitric oxide, or NO, release and produces less peroxynitrite, a biologically harmful product of nitrate action. AB171 also has potent anti-oxidant properties, and these effects may contribute to its favorable differentiation from other nitrates for prevention of myocardial remodeling, anti-atherosclerotic effects and the loss of effectiveness when used as a sustained therapy. We believe the unique pharmacology of AB171, coupled with targeting to genetically-identified enhanced response subpopulations, has the potential to translate to better long-term responses than currently 
 4

available treatments. We have identified what we believe to be a pharmacogenetic target for AB171 we believe may enable genetically-targeted cardiovascular development programs in two cardiovascular indications: HF and peripheral arterial disease. The European Patent Office has issued to us a patent on methods of treating cardiovascular disease and conditions with a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate based on genetic targeting. The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We also have related patent applications pending in the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office. 
 We are currently designing the preclinical development plan for AB171 and initiated Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling activities during 2018; subject to availability of capital, this work would be followed by nonclinical studies with AB171 to support future submission of an IND application, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for peripheral arterial disease and for HF. 
 Financial Resources 
 To support the continued development of Gencaro, including the planned PRECISION-AF clinical trial, we will need additional financing to fund the Phase 3 trial and our general and administrative costs through its projected completion. Considering the substantial time and costs associated with the development of Gencaro and the risk that we may be unable to raise a significant amount of capital on acceptable terms, we may also pursue partnering and licensing opportunities, a strategic combination or other strategic transactions. If we are delayed in obtaining financing or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may discontinue our development activities on Gencaro or discontinue our operations.  
 We believe our cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2018, together with the $2.4 million of net proceeds raised in 2019 from sales of our common stock, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our current cost structure, through the third quarter of 2019. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate.
 In 2017, we entered into a sales agreement, as amended, with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $10.2 million, in an “at the market offering.” In January 2019, we amended the amended sales agreement to increase the maximum aggregate value of shares which we may issue and sell from time to time under this sales agreement by approximately $2.5 million, from $10.2 million to $12.7 million. As of February 22, 2019, we have sold an aggregate of 9,242,406 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, as amended, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $12.6 million. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $11.9 million, after deducting initial expenses for executing the “at the market offering” and commissions paid to the placement agent. We have sold all shares available under the current prospectus. 
 On October 18, 2018, we held a special meeting of our stockholders to approve a series of certificates of amendment to the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding common stock, at a ratio of between 1-for-3 and 1-for-20, inclusive, and to authorize the Company’s board of directors to, for a period of up to one-year, select and file such a certificate of amendment to effect such a reverse split of the Company’s outstanding common stock, if, in the our board’s judgment, it is deemed necessary. Our board of directors has not selected a ratio for the reverse split.
Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company developing cardiovascular therapies, using genetic targeting, where possible, to enhance therapeutic response. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following strategies: 

• | Advance the development of Gencaro. We intend to advance Phase 3 clinical development of Gencaro as a therapy for HF patients with AF. In PRECISION-AF, we plan to evaluate Gencaro as a therapy for patients with HFmrEF, for whom no approved drug therapy currently exists. We received an SPA agreement for PRECISION‑AF that, if successful, could qualify as a single, pivotal trial and support the submission of an NDA for Gencaro. However, our execution of PRECISION-AF and other future Gencaro development is dependent upon our ability to finance those efforts through raising capital or a strategic partnership, or a combination thereof.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Raise additional funding or complete a strategic transaction. To support our continued operations, we expect to seek additional funding through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, the completion of a strategic transaction, or a combination thereof.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Product lifecycle and indication expansion of Gencaro. We believe the treatment of AF in HFmrEF patients is an unmet medical need with a near-term and straightforward regulatory pathway. We believe there are product indication expansion opportunities for Gencaro for the entire spectrum of heart failure, including HFrEF and HFpEF patients with AF, other cardiac arrhythmias, and new formulation development. We are seeking the support of strategic partners to develop these opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Advance the development of AB171. During 2018, we initiated IND-enabling development activities with AB171, a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for HR and peripheral arterial disease. Further development of AB171 is dependent on additional financing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build a cardiovascular pipeline. Our management and employees, including our chief executive officer, are experienced in cardiovascular research, molecular genetics and clinical development of cardiovascular therapies. We are seeking to leverage this expertise to identify, acquire and develop other cardiovascular products or candidates, particularly those with potential for pharmacogenetic based development, such as AB171.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our strategies are dependent upon our ability to obtain additional funding through the sale of public or private equity or debt securities, the completion of a strategic transaction, or a combination thereof. If we are unable to secure additional funding or complete a strategic transaction, we may not be able to continue development of Gencaro, notwithstanding our receipt of an SPA agreement from the FDA. 
 Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure Market Background and Opportunity
Heart failure is a chronic condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s demands for oxygen. Heart failure has numerous serious consequences, including severe impacts on quality of life, increased hospitalizations, lost wages and productivity, and premature death. Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the developed world. According to the 2019 American Heart Association, or AHA, Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, there were an estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 20 years or more with HF (based on data between 2013 and 2016). The spectrum of heart failure includes HF in which LVEF is 50% or more and is considered preserved ejection fraction, known as HFpEF, and heart failure in which the LVEF is less than 40%, considered reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF and LVEF of at least 40%, but less than 50%, considered mid-range ejection fraction, known as HFmrEF. Together, HFrEF and HFmrEF comprise an estimated 64% of all HF patients in the United States. In 2012, the economic cost of HF in the United States was estimated to be nearly $31 billion, of which two-thirds, or over $20 billion, was attributable to direct medical costs. 
 HFmrEF is a subgroup of HF patients with reduced LVEF for whom there are no approved AF drug therapies. The prevalence of AF is higher in HFmrEF patients as compared with HF generally; it is estimated that 30%-60% of HFmrEF patients also have AF. Approximately one-half of the trial population in GENETIC-AF Phase 2B study were HFmrEF patients. In patients with heart failure, atrial fibrillation contributes to the disease processes that lead to the progression of heart failure and worsening clinical outcomes including hospitalizations and death. This increased risk of illness and death when AF is present with heart failure is true across the spectrum of HF, including HFmrEF.
 AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart’s two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF can have significant quality of life impacts and potentially serious medical consequences, including increasing the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems. In individuals with heart failure, AF contributes to the disease processes that lead to the progression of heart failure and worsening clinical outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2015 was 33.3 million. According to AHA Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Reports from 2017 - 2019, the prevalence of AF in the United States was estimated to be 5.2 million people in 2015. In the European Union, the prevalence of AF was estimated to be 8.8 million (age 55 and over) in 2010. It is estimated that AF costs the U.S. economy about $6.0 billion annually.
 AF and HF share many of the same risk factors and about 40% of people having either AF or HF will develop the other condition. Both AF and HF are related to dysfunction and remodeling of the myocardium, and as such share many pathophysiologic features including chamber dilatation, increased interstitial fibrosis and cardiac myocyte apoptosis. However, longstanding AF that eventually leads to left ventricular dysfunction and HF has a different pathophysiology compared to HF with AF developing secondarily. In longstanding AF, fibrosis and hypertrophy develop in both the atrium and ventricles, whereas in HF that precedes AF there is predominantly eccentric hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction in the ventricle and to a lesser extent in the atrium, with only minimal fibrosis in most cases.
 Although AF increases stroke risk above an already increased risk in HF, this risk can be mitigated by administration of oral anticoagulants. Although stroke is the most feared complication of AF, it is the increased risk of mortality and hospitalization conferred by new onset AF in HF that is of major concern. AF in patients with HF may predispose to progression of the disease, including worsening of left ventricular dysfunction, increased hospitalization burden, and increased risk of death. This increased risk of morbidity and mortality with AF appears to be true across the spectrum of HF, including HFmrEF.

Relationship of AF to Clinical Outcomes

AF is an important cardiovascular, or CV, endpoint and it has an even greater impact in patients with HF. An important clinical consequence of AF in HF is an increase in the risk of embolic events including stroke, and for this reason alone it is preferable for a HF patient to be in sinus rhythm, or SR. In patients with established HF it is clear that new onset AF, including new AF events after conversion of persistent AF to SR, is associated with increased mortality and worsening HF risks. Framingham Heart Study data indicate there is a potential interrelationship between the development of AF and HF, with each condition developing as HF progresses and often (21% of the time) both presenting contemporaneously. In the Framingham study, when AF developed after HF there was a 1.6-fold (95% CI: 1.2, 2.1) increase in mortality after adjusting for potential modifiers, and when HF developed after AF the hazard ratio was 2.7 (95% CI: 1.9, 3.7). 
 Additional supporting data is from the Women's Health Study, which is based on 1011 AF cases developed over a 15.4 year span. In this study, new onset AF was associated with a 2.1-fold (95% CI: 1.6, 2.8) increase in ACM and a 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.7, 6.5) increase in CV mortality. Moreover, in women with new onset AF, the risk of developing HF increased by 14.7-fold (95% CI: 11.2, 19.2). New onset AF also worsens the prognosis in patients with established HF, a finding that was observed in the BEST trial as well.
 Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in Heart Failure 
 Effective medical therapy for HF patients with AF must address both disease conditions. Patients with both HF and AF have a significantly worse prognosis, and therefore we believe effective therapies for these patients should be of paramount importance. However, the current drug therapy options for patients with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation are limited. Treatments that have been approved and are effective for HF or AF in isolation are now understood to have efficacy and/or safety limitations if used in patients in whom both conditions are present. Importantly, none of the beta blockers approved for heart failure, or other indications, have been studied exclusively in or approved for patients with HFmrEF, a substantial segment of the total HF population.  
 In treating heart failure, several drugs classes have been shown to improve outcomes and ameliorate symptoms and are now considered standard of care, including in patients with co-morbid AF. Three drugs in the beta-blocker class are approved in the United States for the treatment of heart failure (metoprolol, carvedilol, and bisoprolol). These drugs have the highest level of recommendation in the United States and European Union heart failure guidelines and are prescribed for most patients with HFrEF who also have AF. They continue to be viewed as foundational therapy for these patients in part for their efficacy in controlling the high heart rate that is typically found with AF, rate control, and is believed to contribute to the pathological effects of AF in HF patients. However, the beta blockers approved for HF are only mildly effective at maintaining normal cardiac rhythm, or rhythm control, a characteristic recognized as increasingly important in treating AF. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates that the efficacy of these beta blockers is uncertain when AF is present and becomes permanent. Additionally, none of these beta blockers have been exclusively studied in patients with HFmrEF, thus there is limited evidence of efficacy in patients with HFmrEF, a substantial subgroup of the HF population and about one half of the study population in GENETIC-AF. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a beta-blocker with greater efficacy in controlling AF and in providing better symptom relief and outcome benefits for these patients, including patients with HFmrEF.
 The goals of current medical therapy for AF are to maintain sinus rhythm or to control ventricular rate in patients who cannot maintain sinus rhythm in order to minimize patient symptoms and avoid the risk of further complications and disease progression. Addressing the rhythm and rate abnormalities of AF is believed to be particularly important in HF patients because of the relationship between the presence of AF and worsening heart failure. However, the current treatment options for controlling AF in HF patients have significant limitations. Anti-arrhythmic drugs are a drug class that is often prescribed to control the irregular heartbeat of AF, and these drugs are frequently used in addition to beta-blockers in patients with both heart failure and atrial fibrillation to treat the AF arrhythmia. However, most anti-arrhythmic agents with AF indications are either contraindicated or have significant label warnings for use in HF patients due to an increased risk of mortality.
 In the United States, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy is confined to the Class 3 anti-arrhythmic agents, amiodarone and dofetilide, and amiodarone is not approved for the treatment of AF. In addition, amiodarone has multiple toxicities, is pro-arrhythmic, and likely increases mortality in HFrEF. Although the pro-arrhythmia of dofetilide can be reduced by in-hospital monitoring on institution of therapy, this requirement of dofetilide use does not preclude the potential occurrence of drug induced arrhythmias that can result in death. Considering these safety concerns, physicians treating heart failure patients seek to limit the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs.  
 Surgical techniques, such as ablation, are also used in some patients with heart failure to control the arrhythmia of atrial fibrillation. However, surgical methods are invasive and have other drawbacks, and are not a substitute for drug therapy to provide heart failure benefits, such as with beta-blockade, but rather are generally used in heart failure patients as an additive therapy. Anticoagulants are effective against the risk of stroke in AF patients and are widely prescribed, but these drugs do not address the pathological effects of the irregular and rapid heartbeat that is the hallmark of AF. 
 7

Consequently, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new therapeutics that may provide better treatment for patients with HF and AF, which can safely treat the rhythm and rate disorders in these patients with greater efficacy, while improving their clinical outcomes and prognoses.
 Gencaro 
 Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent with mild vasodilator properties. Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2, receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents them from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, which activate these receptors. We believe Gencaro has two unique anti-adrenergic properties not possessed by other beta-blockers currently approved for the treatment of HF: (1) it is moderately sympatholytic, i.e., it lowers adrenergic drive to a level that can be detected on measurements of central or systemic venous norepinephrine levels, and, (2) through “inverse agonism” promotes inactivation of active-state human myocardial beta-1 receptors in a genotype specific manner. These properties, as described below, were observed to interact with receptor polymorphisms in such a way that we believe targeting specific genotypes of these variants could improve the therapeutic response of patients. We believe Gencaro’s efficacy is enhanced in patients with the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, which we estimate is present in about 50% of the North American and European general populations. 
 Gencaro was the subject of the BEST trial, a Phase 3 HF mortality trial in 2,708 patients, mostly in the United States. The BEST trial included a DNA bank of over 1,000 patients, which was used to evaluate the effect of genetic variations in cardiac receptors on patients’ response to Gencaro. ARCA-affiliated scientists conducted genetic sub-studies with data from the BEST DNA bank that showed patients with certain variations in these receptors had substantially improved outcomes on primary and certain secondary clinical endpoints in the BEST trial, such as mortality, cardiovascular mortality, HF progression, hospitalization and prevention of arrhythmias, relative to the counterpart genotype groups and the general patient population of the trial. We believe that these genetically determined receptor variations, which are detectable using standard DNA testing technology, can serve as diagnostic markers for predicting enhanced therapeutic response to Gencaro, and potentially avoiding adverse events in individual patients. We have patented our methods for treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro in the United States, Europe and other markets based on genetic testing. 
 Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics 
 Gencaro’s pharmacology appears to be different from other compounds in the beta-blocker class in several fundamental respects. First, under previous sponsors, studies in human myocardial preparations showed Gencaro, but not other tested beta-blockers approved to treat HF, predisposes to a shift in equilibrium of beta-1 389 arginine but not 389 glycine receptors from a constitutively active to an inactive state, a property known as inverse agonism. Second, other studies, including BEST, indicated that Gencaro lowers the systemic levels of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, released by cardiac and other adrenergic nerves. The beta-1 389 arginine receptor, 100% of the receptor population in patients with a 389 arginine homozygous genotype, has much higher affinity for binding to NE compared to 389 glycine receptors, and published data indicate that NE lowering from Gencaro is beneficial in patients who have only beta-1 389 arginine receptors. In contrast, patients with lower NE affinity beta-1 389 glycine genotypes may have blunting of efficacy from greater amounts of NE lowering. We believe that Gencaro's inverse agonist property contributes to the enhanced lowering of heart failure and arrhythmia event rates in patients who are beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype relative to individuals who are beta-1 389 Gly carriers or to the general population. In addition, we believe the unique NE lowering properties of Gencaro have a selectively beneficial effect in patients who have only beta-1 389 arginine receptors, because of the high affinity of these receptors for NE. As a result, the GENETIC-AF trial was targeted at patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, which was present in approximately 50% of screened patients. We believe that these properties and their pharmacogenetic implications for modulating effectiveness are unique to Gencaro, and if the drug is approved, will be described in in the prescribing information. 
Gencaro Heart Failure Development and the DNA Substudy
 Gencaro was the subject of a major heart failure study known as the BEST trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of bucindolol’s effect on reduction of mortality and morbidity in an advanced chronic HF population (LVEF less than 35%). The primary endpoint of the BEST trial was ACM, and the pre-specified main secondary endpoint was progression of HF, defined as death from HF, cardiac transplant, HF hospitalization, or an emergency room visit for the treatment of worsening HF not requiring hospitalization. The trial was planned to run four and one-half years, and enroll 2,800 patients. The trial enrolled a total of 2,708 chronic, mostly U.S., HF patients. The trial was notable for including a major DNA bank, in which 1,040 of the BEST patients participated by providing blood for DNA analysis. The DNA bank provided the basis for the genetic substudies that discovered Gencaro’s modulation by genetic variations of the beta-1 cardiac receptor. 
 The BEST trial was terminated early because, after positive mortality results from two other HF trials involving other beta-blockers had been reported, a substantial number of BEST trial investigators concluded that it was unethical to continue to give placebo to 
 8

BEST trial participants. It was initially reported the trial had failed to reach its primary endpoint of ACM, showing a 10% risk reduction in mortality with a p-value of 0.10. Our reanalysis of the BEST results in accordance with the FDA approved, pre-specified statistical analysis plans (which had not been performed by the sponsors of BEST) demonstrated a 13% risk reduction on the primary endpoint of ACM in the BEST trial with a p-value of 0.053. 
 The results of the genetic substudies that were conducted using the BEST DNA bank were not available until several years after the completion of the trial. Importantly, these substudies indicated a significant enhancement of response on the major heart failure clinical endpoints from the BEST trial in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. The risk reduction on HF clinical efficacy endpoints such as mortality and hospitalization ranged from 34% to 48% in this genotype. In addition, in arrhythmia endpoints of atrial fibrillation, or VT/VF, tracked by adverse events, or AEs, and surveillance electrocardiograms, or ECGs, the risk reduction by bucindolol in the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype appeared to be even greater, with risk reductions of 74% for both endpoints. 
 Shown below are certain of the primary and secondary endpoint data from the BEST HF DNA substudy results, by genotype:

 Analysis of BEST trial for AF 
 The BEST study data were further analyzed focusing on AF prevention, rate control in patients with established AF, and on clinical outcomes of patients with AF. Although there was no pre-determined AF endpoint, including reduction in risk of AF, in the BEST trial, according to our analysis of adverse events and surveillance ECG’s during the trial, 7.9% of patients developed new onset AF, with a greater incidence observed in the placebo group (9.7%) compared to the bucindolol group (6.2%). This corresponded to a 36% reduction in the incidence of new onset AF (based on crude event rates) for patients receiving bucindolol (p = 0.002). In a time to event analysis, the risk of new onset AF was reduced by 41% (p = 0.0004) with bucindolol treatment. Patients in the BEST study with the beta-1 389 Arg/Arg genotype who received Gencaro had a 74% reduction in the risk of developing new onset AF (p = 0.0003). 
 Further published analyses of the data from BEST suggest that Gencaro may also have potential efficacy for other clinical endpoints and outcomes related to AF. A published analysis of the BEST data revealed that of the 303 patients in the BEST trial with established AF, 67% of those who received Gencaro achieved ventricular response rate control, defined as a resting heart rate of less than or equal to 80 beats per minute without symptomatic bradycardia (p < 0.005). In AF patients who achieved ventricular response rate control, Gencaro produced a 39% reduction (p = 0.025) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations. In addition, Gencaro also improved cardiovascular clinical endpoints for those AF patients possessing the beta-1 389 arginine genotype that ARCA believes is most favorable for Gencaro response. In a substudy of 1,040 patients in BEST in which patient genotypes were analyzed, Gencaro was associated with a 72% decrease (p = 0.039) in cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalizations in those 52 AF patients in the substudy with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype.

Analysis of the BEST Study data also shows that Gencaro has potential efficacy against the serious arrhythmias of VT/VF, which also appears to be genetically regulated. A published report demonstrated that patients in the BEST Trial who received Gencaro experienced a 58% reduction in the incidence of VT/VF (p = 0.00006), adjusted for the competing risk of mortality. In addition, the authors of this report determined that Gencaro reduced the incidence of VT/VF by 74% (p = 0.00005) in patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. 
 Clinical and Regulatory Strategy
 The regulatory strategy for Gencaro is to obtain an initial approval to treat atrial fibrillation in a genotype specific population with HFmrEF. We enrolled patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype in our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B clinical trial because our analysis of the BEST DNA substudy demonstrated a 74% reduction in AF events, in addition to reducing event rates for major clinical endpoints such as mortality and HF hospitalizations. 
 
In February 2018, we reported the results of GENETIC-AF, our Phase 2B clinical superiority trial, in which we evaluated Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of recurrent AF in patients with HF (LVEF less than 0.50). GENETIC‑AF compared Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is considered a standard of care for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. The GENETIC-AF trial only enrolled patients with the beta‑1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, the specific genotype that we believe enhances Gencaro’s potential therapeutic effects. Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, metoprolol succinate. However, additional analyses prespecified in the statistical analysis plan also showed clinically meaningful treatment effects in favor of Gencaro in a large majority of the Phase 2 population. Gencaro also showed a significant treatment effect compared to Toprol XL in reducing AF recurrence in a subgroup of HF patients with HFmrEF. About one-half of the GENETIC-AF population were HFmrEF patients, a HF population for which there are no approved or guideline-recommended therapies. We plan to conduct a Phase 3 pivotal superiority trial, known as PRECISION-AF, evaluating Gencaro in this population because of Gencaro’s observed potential treatment effect in these patients in the GENETIC‑AF trial, the unmet medical need for approved or guideline recommended drug therapies for prevention of AF in HFmrEF patients, and what we believe to be a near-term path to potential regulatory approval with this indication.
 Based on our GENETIC-AF trial results, as well as results of previous Phase 3 pharmacogenetic substudy data from the Phase 3 heart failure clinical trial of bucindolol, known as the BEST trial, we submitted an SPA to the FDA detailing our proposed Phase 3 clinical trial and potential approval path for Gencaro. In February 2019, we received an SPA agreement for PRECISION-AF, a Phase 3 pivotal study comparing Gencaro against TOPROL-XL for the treatment of AF in HFmrEF patients with the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. FDA also provided guidance on the possible development of Gencaro in HFrEF and HFpEF patients, which we feel are potential product life cycle opportunities for Gencaro.
 
The PRECISION-AF Phase 3 clinical trial is designed as a double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, international, adaptive study comparing Gencaro with TOPROL-XL for the prevention of recurrent AF/AFL or ACM, in HFmrEF patients. The study will enroll approximately 400 patients at investigative sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Eligible patients will have HFmrEF, a recent AF event and the genotype which responds most favorably to Gencaro. A substudy planned to include a smaller group of patients within the trial would utilize AFB as one method to determine AF recurrence, as measured by an implanted cardiac electronic device. The planned trial will use standard significance criteria (p < 0.01with adjustment for interim analysis) for the primary endpoint and will include an interim analysis after a portion of total patients have been enrolled. The interim analysis is designed to assess safety, validate initial study assumptions and maintain adequate statistical power for the primary endpoint. Subject to securing significant additional financing, we anticipate initiating PRECISION-AF in the fourth quarter of 2019. Any future development of Gencaro, including initiating the Phase 3 clinical trial, is dependent on obtaining additional financing, even if we enter into a strategic collaboration around the development of Gencaro.
 In 2015, the FDA designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in a genetically targeted heart failure population (heart failure patients with reduced LVEF) as a Fast Track development program.  
 Fast Track drug development designation was included in the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, as a formal process to enhance interactions with the FDA during drug development. A drug development program with Fast Track designation is eligible for consideration for some or all of the following programs for expediting development and review: scheduled meetings to seek FDA input into development plans, priority review of the NDA the option of submitting portions of an NDA for review prior to submission of the complete application and potential accelerated approval.

The Gencaro Test 
 If approved, we believe that Gencaro will be the first cardiovascular drug to be integrated with a companion diagnostic to predict enhanced efficacy. We believe the drug label we will propose for Gencaro would identify the patient receptor genotype studied in the trial that can expect enhanced efficacy and, and that the label would recommend receptor genotype testing prior to initiation of therapy. Therefore, the commercialization of Gencaro may require that an FDA approved diagnostic test for this genotype be available. Such a test, or the Gencaro Test, could be performed by a variety of laboratory processes or platforms. We used one such platform for the GENETIC-AF trial, and retain all rights to it. We believe the Genaro Test could be developed and commercialized through a preferred diagnostic provider, by the company marketing Gencaro, or a combination of approaches. We also believe that point of care genetic tests, which could be performed during the patient’s visit to the physician, may be feasible as part of the commercialization strategy.
 Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro required a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype. Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, developed the genetic test, obtained an IDE from the FDA and provided the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC-AF trial. We retain all rights to the genetic test. Future clinical trials of Gencaro, if any, are expected to use a similar diagnostic test to identify the patient’s receptor genotype.
 Licensing and Royalty Obligations 
 We have licensed worldwide rights to all preclinical and clinical data
 from development of bucindolol through the BEST trial from Cardiovascular Pharmacology and Engineering Consultants, LLC, or CPEC, who has licensed rights to this data from BMS. In addition, we have sublicensed CPEC’s rights from Bristol Meyers Squibb, or BMS. CPEC is a licensing entity which holds the rights of the biotechnology companies that were the commercial sponsors of the BEST trial. If the FDA grants marketing approval for Gencaro, the license agreements state that we are required to make a milestone payment of $8.0 million within six months after FDA approval. The license agreements also state that we are required to make milestone payments of up to $5.0 million in the aggregate upon regulatory marketing approval in Europe and Japan. The licenses state that our royalty obligations range from 12.5% to 25% of revenue from the related product based on achievement of specified product sales levels including a 5% royalty that CPEC is obligated to pay BMS. The agreements state that we have the right to buy down the royalties to a range of 12.5% to 17% by making a payment to CPEC within six months of regulatory approval. In October 2017, we entered into an agreement with CPEC’s minority owner, Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Aeolus, pursuant to which we acquired Aeolus’ minority membership interest in CPEC. The transaction effectively buys-out Aeolus’ royalty interest thereby reducing or eliminating the stated milestone and royalty obligations by 35% that could be payable by us, if Gencaro receives regulatory approval and is commercialized. In the transaction, we also acquired all of CPEC’s rights to milestones and royalties for Europe and certain other territories outside of the United States.
 All of the patents that were the subject of the CPEC and BMS licenses have expired. Based on this and the terms of these licenses, we believe that the financial obligations stated in these agreements will be reduced or eliminated, if and when they become payable under their stated terms.
 We also have licensed worldwide rights to intellectual property covering the pharmacogenetic response of Gencaro based on the cardiac receptor polymorphisms, which is owned by the University of Colorado. We have no material future financial obligations under this license. We also have licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to develop and commercialize diagnostics for these receptor polymorphisms, for the purpose of prescribing Gencaro. 
 Development Pipeline 
 Our development activities are substantially focused on our lead product candidate, Gencaro, for the potential treatment of HF patients with AF. The primary endpoint of the GENETIC-AF trial was the prevention of AF in these patients. We believe the treatment of AF in HFmrEF patients is an unmet medical need with a near term and straightforward regulatory pathway. We believe there are product indication expansion opportunities for Gencaro for the entire spectrum of heart failure, including HFrEF and HFpEF patients with AF, other cardiac arrhythmias, and new formulation development. We are seeking the support of strategic partners to develop these opportunities. Finally, we have developed and patented an isomer version of bucindolol, which appears to be substantially more potent than the current formulation. 
 We do not expect to pursue development of Gencaro for HFmrEF patients with AF or other disease indications without obtaining additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership or collaboration. We believe Gencaro has potential to address these additional indications, and that the clinical response of patients with these diseases may be genetically influenced, based on the same genetic markers we have identified for our proposed treatment of AF with Gencaro. 
 AB171 is a thiol-containing derivative of isosorbide mononitrate. Pre-clinical data indicate that AB171 may have anti-oxidant properties and may be favorably differentiated from other nitrates for prevention of myocardial remodeling, anti-atherosclerotic effects and the loss of effectiveness when used as a sustained therapy. We believe the unique pharmacology of AB171, coupled with targeting to genetically-identified enhanced response subpopulations, has the potential to translate to better long-term responses than currently available treatments. We have identified what we believe to be a pharmacogenetic target for AB171 that is the basis for our patents and which we believe may enable genetically-targeted cardiovascular development programs in two cardiovascular indications: HF 
 11

and peripheral arterial disease. The European Patent Office has issued to us a patent on methods of treating cardiovascular disease and conditions with a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate based on genetic targeting. The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We also have related patent applications pending in the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
We are currently designing the preclinical development plan for AB171 and initiated IND enabling activities during 2018, and subject to availability of capital, to be followed by nonclinical studies with AB171 to support future submission of an IND application, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for HF and peripheral arterial disease. 
 We also have exclusive pharmacogenetic and other patent rights to drug candidates that have potential indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology and other therapeutic areas. We may seek partners to assist us in the development of these candidates or who may license them. We may also seek funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.  
 Competition 
 Current HF treatments include three beta-blockers approved for heart failure in the Unites States. However, their efficacy in providing control of the arrhythmia caused by AF, or rhythm control, is only mild. It is also now acknowledged that evidence is lacking that the approved beta-blockers provide outcome benefits for patients who develop permanent AF. Furthermore, these drugs have not demonstrated efficacy for patients with HFmrEF, a population included in the Gencaro development program. Current AF treatments include pharmaceutical, procedural or device intervention. There are several antiarrhythmic drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment and/or prevention of recurrent AF. However, these drugs have safety and/or administration concerns and all but one have contraindications or label warnings regarding their prescription in patients with heart failure. 
 Drugs that are currently approved or used for the treatment or prevention of AF in HF, including HFmrEF, either have not demonstrated efficacy in these patients, or have notable risks due to adverse side effects or lack sufficient efficacy. Therefore, in HF, and specifically in HFmrEF patients, we believe there is a substantial unmet medical need for AF therapies that are more effective and have fewer side effects than those currently available. We believe that Gencaro’s treatment of AF in HF patients could provide a more effective and safer pharmacotherapy than treatments currently used in these patients. 
 The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to treat cardiovascular conditions. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing, and commercial resources than we have. 
 If approved, the drugs which Gencaro would potentially compete with are largely generic in the United States. Gencaro would be priced at a premium compared to these therapies. In addition, our proposed prescribing information for Gencaro includes a recommendation for genetic testing, which will add additional procedures to the process of prescribing Gencaro, which, together with its premium price, could make it more difficult for us to compete against existing or future therapies. 
 Manufacturing and Product Supply 
 Gencaro is a small molecule drug with an established manufacturing history. Multiple manufacturers of both the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and drug product have successfully produced Gencaro for use in clinical trials over the course of its clinical development. We outsource all manufacturing and analytical testing of the Gencaro API and drug product. We have selected third party contract manufacturing organizations on the basis of their technical and regulatory expertise. Our approach with our contract manufacturing partners has been to replicate the manufacturing processes that were used to support the prior pivotal clinical trial with Gencaro, and to minimize any changes from these baseline processes, thereby reducing technical and regulatory risk. We contracted with Groupe Novasep to complete the drug substance registration batches required for the Gencaro NDA. These batches were successful, and the resulting drug substance was used to supply the drug product registration campaign. Remaining inventory was placed in current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, storage to provide a backup supply for the GENETIC-AF trial, and for use as an initial source of drug substance to support eventual product launch, if approved. 
 For drug product production, we have contracted with Patheon, Inc. to manufacture the Gencaro tablets. Gencaro is produced in a tablet form, utilizing standard solid oral dosage processing techniques. Six separate dosage strengths were manufactured, with the maximum recommended dose of 50mg twice daily for patients weighing 75kg or less and 100mg twice daily for patients weighing more than 75kg. Registration batches were successfully completed by Patheon, Inc. and tablets from these runs were placed in cGMP storage to supply the GENETIC-AF trial. In addition, we contracted with a separate service provider for packaging and distribution of our clinical trial materials.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Our research and development expenses were $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $14.1 million for 2017, a decrease of approximately $9.8 million. Subject to securing significant additional financing, we anticipate initiating our PRECISION‑AF clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2019. R&D expense in 2019 is expected to be higher than 2018, if we initiate our PRECISION‑AF clinical trial. If we are unable to initiate our PRECISION‑AF clinical trial, then R&D expense is expected to be lower than 2018.
Government Regulation 
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels and foreign countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, marketing, distribution, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical and medical device products. In the United States, the FDA regulates these activities at the federal level pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In Canada, Health Canada regulates these activities. In Europe, the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees of the respective countries regulate these activities. We anticipate that all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The process of obtaining approval and the subsequent process of maintaining compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. In addition, these statutes, rules, regulations and policies may change and our products may be subject to new legislation or regulations. Both before and after approval or clearance, failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other state and federal statutes can lead to significant penalties or could disrupt our ability to manufacture and sell these products. In addition, the FDA could refuse to provide certificates needed to export our products if the agency determines that we are not in compliance. 
Premarket Approval of Drugs 
 FDA approval is required for marketing of any new drug, dosage form, indication, or strength. The steps required before new human therapeutic drug products are marketed in the United States and foreign countries include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and comparable agencies in foreign countries. There is no guarantee that products will be approved in a specific timeframe or at all. 
 Preclinical Phase. Preclinical studies are generally conducted in the laboratory to identify potential drug candidates and to evaluate their potential efficacy and safety. These studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate short and long-term toxicity in animals. Preclinical studies are governed by numerous regulations, including but not limited to FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices. 
 Clinical Phase. Before human clinical trials can commence, an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, submitted to FDA must become effective. For an IND to become effective, the applicant must submit, among other things, information on design of the proposed investigation, reports necessary to assess the safety of the drug for use in clinical investigation, and information on the chemistry and manufacturing of the drug, controls available for the drug, and primary data tabulations from animal or human studies. The clinical phase of development involves the performance of human studies, including adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication. Typically, clinical evaluation involves three sequential phases, which may overlap. During Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a relatively small number of subjects or patients to determine the early safety profile of a product candidate, as well as dose tolerance, absorption, and the pattern of drug distribution and drug metabolism. Phase 2 trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted by a specific target disease to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosage tolerance and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. In Phase 3, larger-scale, multi- center trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a specific target disease over a longer term to confirm Phase 2 results and provide reliable and conclusive data supporting efficacy and safety of a drug as required by regulatory agencies for drug approval. The conduct of clinical trials is subject to extensive regulation. FDA may delay or suspend clinical trials through clinical holds. 
 NDA Submission. In the United States, the results of preclinical and clinical testing along with chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA. Under the current Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, after submission of an NDA and payment, or waiver, of the required fee, the FDA’s goal is to review most standard NDAs within 10 months from the time that a sponsor’s application is accepted as filed by the FDA, which can occur within a 60-day window following the initial submission of the application. At the end of the 10 months, the FDA’s goal is to issue a “complete response,” or approve the NDA. While FDA’s goal is to issue a complete response within 10 months, the process may take longer than 10 months, particularly if multiple review cycles are required. Gencaro has been granted Fast Track Designation which allows for a rolling review of a marketing application. A rolling review allows FDA to consider reviewing portions of an NDA before the sponsor submits the complete application.
 13

In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval or deny the application if the FDA determines that the application does not satisfy the statutory and regulatory approval criteria. A denial may include a request for additional information, including additional clinical data and/or an additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Under the Food and Drug Modernization Act of 1997, the FDA is authorized to approve a drug based on a single adequate and well-controlled study if such study and other confirmatory data are sufficient to establish the drug’s effectiveness. However, it has long been the FDA’s general position that the standard of proof of a drug’s effectiveness generally requires at least two well-controlled and adequate Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrating statistically significant results as compared to a placebo or active control (with p-values of less than 0.05) with respect to the primary endpoint or endpoints of the trial. 
 In addition, in accordance with current FDA law and regulations, the FDA may refer a drug to an advisory committee for review prior to approval. Most new compounds are referred to an FDA advisory committee, which could add additional time to the review process. There is no guarantee that the advisory committee will recommend approval of a drug candidate. In some cases, FDA may require completion, within a specified time period, of additional clinical studies after approval, referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, to monitor the effect of a new product and may prevent or limit future marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. Furthermore, prior to granting approval, the FDA generally conducts an inspection of the facilities, including outsourced facilities that will be involved in the manufacture, production, packaging, testing and control of the drug substance and finished drug product for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. 
 If the FDA approves the NDA, the sponsor is authorized to begin commercialization of the drug in accordance with the approval. Even if the FDA approves the NDA, the FDA may decide later to suspend or withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems are recognized after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, and the agency has the power to require additional clinical studies, to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA also has authority to request implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, that could restrict distribution of Gencaro or require us to provide additional risk information to prescribers. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by comparable foreign regulatory authorities is necessary prior to the commencement of marketing of a product candidate in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required for FDA approval. 
 Post-approval Compliance. If regulatory approval for a drug or medical device is obtained, the product and the facilities manufacturing the product are subject to periodic inspection and continued regulation by regulatory authorities, including compliance with cGMP, as well as labeling, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events. In addition, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for labeling, promotion to health care professionals, direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Companies are responsible for compliance with such requirements and would be responsible to ensure that all contract manufacturing organizations who perform work for them also comply with such requirements. Similarly, if a drug manufacturer hires contract sales representatives or consultants to promote its products, such organizations or individuals must comply with all of the same requirements applicable to the drug manufacturer. The FDA regularly inspects companies to determine compliance with cGMPs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with statutory requirements and the FDA’s regulations can result in a variety of administrative or enforcement actions, including but not limited to an FDA Form 483 (which is issued by the FDA at the conclusions of an inspection when an investigator has observed any conditions that may constitute violations), a public warning letter, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product detentions, refusal to provide export certificates, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. 
 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides for patent term restoration and the award, in certain circumstances, of non-patent marketing exclusivities. 
 14

Generic Drug Approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act established an abbreviated FDA review process for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to approved pioneer drugs. Approval for a generic drug is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. Generic drug applications are “abbreviated” because they generally do not include clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, an ANDA applicant must establish that its product is bioequivalent to an approved drug and that it is the same as the approved drug with respect to active ingredient(s), route of administration, dosage form, strength and recommended conditions of use (labeling). The FDA will approve the generic as suitable for an ANDA if it finds that the generic does not raise questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the pioneer drug. A drug is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the pioneer drug or if it is intended for a different use. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of an approved drug listed in FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or the Orange Book, must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug has been listed in the Orange Book; (ii) that each patent listed in the Orange Book for that approved drug has expired; (iii) FDA should approve the product on the date on which a listed patent expires; or (iv) that such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the generic drug. If the ANDA applicant makes a certification pursuant to (iv) above, or a Paragraph IV certification, and the NDA holder files an infringement suit against the ANDA applicant within 45 days of receiving the Paragraph IV notification, the NDA owner is entitled to an automatic 30-month stay of FDA’s ability to approve the ANDA. This 30-month stay will end early upon any decision by a court that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the generic drug. 
 Patent Term Extension. While the term of a U.S. patent is generally 20 years from the earliest priority date of a patent application (excluding a provisional patent application), a U.S. patent that covers subject matter requiring regulatory approval to market is eligible for an extension of that patent term. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of an application. Patent Term Extension, or PTE, extends the term of an issued patent for generally (i) the length of the FDA approval process, i.e., the complete period of NDA review, and (ii) half of the time spent in clinical trials, i.e., the IND period. However, the maximum period of restoration cannot exceed five years, or restore the total remaining term of the patent to greater than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. 
 Under 35 U.S.C. § 156(a), a patent covering a method of using a product is eligible for PTE if the following conditions are met: 
  
1) | the patent has not yet expired;
---+--------------------------------


2) | the patent was not previously extended;
---+----------------------------------------


3) | the patent owner submits an application for PTE that includes all necessary supporting information within 60 days of FDA approval;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | the product was subject to regulatory review before its commercial marketing or use; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5) | the drug application is for the first permitted commercial marketing of the product.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have obtained four U.S. patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,678,824; 8,080,578; 8,093,286; 8,946,284). We believe that, if Gencaro is approved by the FDA, any one of the U.S. patents may be eligible for PTE, which could provide approximately 5 years of additional patent life based on our current clinical trial plans. 
 A Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC, is a form of patent term extension that is available for pharmaceutical products approved for marketing in the European Union, or EU. We obtained a patent in Europe on methods for using Gencaro that is similar to US Patent 7,678,824 (EP 1802775); this EU patent is in force in certain countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We believe that this patent may be eligible for an SPC, if Gencaro is approved for marketing in any European country in which the patent is in force, which could provide up to five years of additional patent life. We believe that our patents in other jurisdictions may also be eligible for similar term extensions.
 Non-Patent Marketing Exclusivities. Separate and apart from patent protection, the Hatch-Waxman Act entitles approved drugs to various periods of non-patent statutory protection, known as marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of “new chemical entity” marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a product that contains an active moiety not found in any other approved product. This exclusivity means that another manufacturer cannot submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the marketing exclusivity period ends. This exclusivity protects the entire new chemical entity franchise, including all products containing the active ingredient for any use and in any strength or dosage form, but will not prevent the submission or approval of stand-alone NDAs where the applicants have conducted their own clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. There is an exception, however, for a competitor that seeks to challenge a patent with a Paragraph IV certification. Four years into the five-year exclusivity period, a manufacturer who alleges that one or more of the patents listed with the NDA is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed may submit an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for a generic or modified version of the product. 
 15

The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of “new use” marketing exclusivity for the approval of NDAs, and supplements, where those applications contain the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA’s approval of the applications. Such applications may be submitted for new indications, dosage forms, strengths, or new conditions of use of approved products. So long as the studies are essential to the FDA’s approval or were conducted by or for the applicant, this three-year exclusivity prohibits the final approval of ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for products with the specific changes associated with those studies. It does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for other products containing the same active ingredient, without those changes. 
 Similar non-patent market exclusivity is provided for in the EU and other international jurisdictions. We believe that, if approved in the EU, Gencaro may be eligible for ten years of market exclusivity in the EU, measured from the date of approval there.
 FDA Premarket Review of Medical Devices 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that a company wishes to market in the United States requires either approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, or clearance of a premarket notification, commonly known as a “510(k)” from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which may require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. Clearance of a 510(k) usually requires between three months and one year from the time of submission of the 510(k), although the process may take longer. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance procedure is less rigorous than the PMA approval procedure, but is available only to companies who can establish that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed “predicate” device that was (i) on the market prior to the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, (ii) reclassified from Class III to Class II, or (iii) has been cleared through the 510(k) procedure. 510(k)s must typically be supported by performance data, including preclinical data, bench testing, and in some cases, clinical data. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, or for which there is no predicate, are placed in class III, and require a PMA. 
 PMA Pathway. Generally, a PMA must be supported by extensive data and valid scientific evidence, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information and will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSR. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application”, although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, and it may take significantly longer. The PMA application process can be expensive, and there is a substantial “user fee” that must be paid to FDA in connection with the submission of a PMA application. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application or the manufacturing facility is not favorable, the FDA may deny approval of the PMA application or issue a “not approvable” letter. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials, which can delay the PMA approval process by several years. In addition, if FDA discovers that an applicant has submitted false or misleading information, FDA may refuse to review submissions until certain requirements are met pursuant to its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. If the FDA approves the PMA, it may place restrictions on the device. After the PMA is approved, if significant changes are made to a device, its manufacturing or labeling, a PMA supplement containing additional information must be filed for prior FDA approval. PMA supplements often must be approved by the FDA before the modification to the device, the labeling, or the manufacturing process may be implemented. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive such clearances or approvals, the loss of previously received clearances or approvals, or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the proposed study is deemed a non-significant risk study, which is eligible for an exemption from the IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites. Submission of an IDE application does not give assurance that the FDA will issue the IDE. If the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan in such a way that may affect its scientific soundness, study indication or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects. The trial must also comply with the FDA’s regulations, including the requirement that informed consent be obtained from each subject. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the United States.
 In Vitro Diagnostic Companion Diagnostic Devices. FDA has described IVD companion diagnostic devices as in vitro diagnostic devices that provide information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of an IVD companion diagnostic device with a particular therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the labeling of both the diagnostic device and the corresponding therapeutic product, as well as in the labeling of any generic equivalents of the therapeutic 
 16

product. An IVD companion diagnostic device could be used to (i) identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; (ii) identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with a particular therapeutic product; or (iii) monitor response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g., schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. Although FDA’s regulation of IVD companion diagnostic devices is evolving and implemented on a case-by-case basis, FDA’s stated policy for a novel therapeutic product is that an IVD companion diagnostic device should be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously to support the therapeutic product’s safe and effective use. The clinical performance and clinical significance of the IVD companion diagnostic device is to be established using data from the clinical development program of the corresponding therapeutic product. FDA recognizes, however, that there may be cases where contemporaneous development may not be possible. With respect to the Gencaro Test, there is no assurance that we will be able to develop and obtain approval or clearance contemporaneously with Gencaro. Failure to develop the Gencaro Test or obtain clearance or approval could delay approval of Gencaro, if FDA regards the Gencaro Test as an IVD companion diagnostic test that is essential to the safe and effective use of Gencaro. 
 Continuing Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the manufacturer, or holder of a PMA approval. Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices distributed in the United States must be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, and current good manufacturing practices. These regulations govern the manufacturing process, including design, manufacture, testing, release, packaging, distribution, documentation and purchasing, as well as complaint handling, corrective and preventative actions and internal auditing. In complying with the QSRs, manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort. Companies are also subject to other post-market and general requirements, including but not limited to product listing and establishment registration, post-market surveillance requirements, limitations on promotion, and requirements for recordkeeping and reporting of certain adverse events, malfunctions, corrections and removals. As discussed above, FDA regularly inspects companies to assess compliance with the QSRs and other post-market requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, and potential civil and criminal penalties. As part of such arrangement, we will seek to have the diagnostic company take responsibility for compliance with the FDA’s device approval and on-going regulatory requirements. 
 International Marketing Approvals. International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country and are subject to change. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements. We are also subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our work. The extent and character of governmental regulation that might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. 
Medical Device Tax
 In March 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted and President Obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation. Among other initiatives, these laws impose significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on U.S. medical device sales, with certain exemptions, beginning on January 1, 2013. On January 22, 2018, legislation was enacted suspending the medical device tax in 2018 and 2019. It will be reinstated on January 1, 2020, unless a permanent repeal takes place before that date. The Gencaro Test is likely to be subject to this tax if this tax is reinstated in the future.
Intellectual Property 
 The future success of our business will partly depend on our ability to maintain market exclusivity for Gencaro, if approved, in the United States and important international markets, and for other products or product candidates that we may acquire or develop. We will rely on statutory protection, patent protection, trade secrets, know-how, and in-licensing of technology rights to maintain protection for our products. 
 We believe that both patent protection and data exclusivity statutes will give Gencaro, if approved, market exclusivity in the United States and in major international markets. If approved by the FDA or international regulatory agencies, Gencaro will qualify as a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, as it has never received regulatory approval in any jurisdiction. As an NCE, Gencaro, if approved, will enjoy market exclusivity in the United States and most international markets under data exclusivity statutes. These laws provide for an exclusivity period beginning from regulatory approval, during which any generic competitor is barred from submitting an application that relies on the data that has been submitted in connection with the approval of the NCE. In the United States, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an initial period of up to five years from approval of the NCE, during which a generic application attempting to rely on the data submitted for the NCE cannot be filed with the FDA. This period can be effectively extended to seven and one-half years from FDA approval because a provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for an automatic 30-month extension of the exclusivity 
 17

period if we promptly pursue litigation against a company attempting to enter the market with a generic for a drug that is covered by a composition of matter or method of use patent. 
 Many international markets have data exclusivity statutes that are analogous to Hatch-Waxman and sometimes more protective. The analogous statute in the European Medicines Evaluation Agency will, in general, provide Gencaro with a minimum of ten years of protection from marketing approval before such a generic application may be approved. Protection under Hatch-Waxman and other data exclusivity statutes is sometimes considered superior to patent protection, as the generic cannot be marketed during the period of exclusivity, thus eliminating the need to initiate patent infringement litigation with its accompanying risks and costs. 
 In addition to protection under data exclusivity statutes, we believe that Gencaro’s patent portfolio will also provide market exclusivity, if approved. We have been granted patents in the United States and Europe that claim the use of Gencaro in patients predicted to have a favorable response to the drug based on genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding the beta-1 and/or alpha-2C receptors. We believe that this patent strategy may deter generic competition because of the threat of patent litigation or may exclude generic competition from the market until the patents expire if we are successful in litigation. Consequently, if our patent strategy is successful, we believe we may avoid generic competition with Gencaro in the United States or certain countries in Europe until at least the expiration of these patents, which would be no earlier than 2026 in the United States and into 2025 in Europe. In addition, we believe that if Gencaro is approved, any one of our U.S. patents may be entitled to an extension of its term and the European patent may be entitled to an extension through a supplemental protection certificate in one or more countries in Europe. The length of any such extension may vary by country. We cannot predict whether any such extensions will be granted, but if they are, they may provide market exclusivity for Gencaro into approximately 2031 in the United States and Europe. In addition, we were granted a patent on the S-isomer formulation of Gencaro, which we believe could be important in Gencaro’s future development and could extend market exclusivity of the S-isomer form in the United States to approximately 2034, assuming it is the first approved formulation. 
 For AB171, the European Patent Office issued patent on methods of treating cardiovascular disease and conditions with a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate based on genetic targeting. The European patent, entitled “Methods and Compositions for Cardiovascular Diseases and Conditions,” provides protection for this novel approach to treating patients with cardiovascular disease and conditions. The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We have related patent applications pending at the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office.
 We also have other patent rights in additional drug candidates having possible indications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, and other therapeutic areas; these are in both early and later stages of development. We may seek collaborators to assist us in the development of these candidates or we may seek to raise funds to advance the development of the compounds on our own.
