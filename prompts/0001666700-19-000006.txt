The Company's website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report.
THE INTENDED BUSINESS SEPARATIONS
DowDuPont plans to separate into three, independent, publicly traded companies - one for each of its agriculture, materials science and specialty products businesses (the “Intended Business Separations” and the transactions to accomplish the Intended Business Separations, the “separations”). DowDuPont has formed two wholly owned subsidiaries: Dow Holdings Inc., to serve as a holding company for its materials science business, and Corteva, Inc., to serve as a holding company for its agriculture business. 
In furtherance of the Intended Business Separations, DowDuPont is engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps (the “Internal Reorganization”) to realign its businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. As part of the Internal Reorganization, the assets and liabilities aligned with the materials science business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Dow Holdings Inc. and the assets and liabilities aligned with the agriculture business will be transferred or conveyed to legal entities that will ultimately be subsidiaries of Corteva, Inc. 
Following the Internal Reorganization, DowDuPont expects to distribute its materials science and agriculture businesses through two separate U.S. federal tax-free spin-offs in which DowDuPont stockholders, at the time of such spin-offs, will receive a pro rata dividend of the shares of the capital stock of Dow Holdings Inc. and of Corteva, Inc., as applicable (the “distributions”). The materials science business, after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization, will be referred to as “Dow” and the agriculture business, after the consummation of the applicable Internal Reorganization, will be referred to as “Corteva.” Following the separation and distribution of Dow, which is targeted to occur on April 1, 2019, DowDuPont, as the remaining company, will continue to hold the agriculture and specialty products businesses. DowDuPont is then targeted to complete the separation and distribution of Corteva on June 1, 2019, resulting in DowDuPont holding the specialty products businesses of the combined Company. After the distribution of Corteva, it is expected that DowDuPont will become known as "DuPont."
3

Prior to the distribution of Dow, DowDuPont intends to enter into a separation agreement with Corteva and Dow (the “separation agreement”) setting forth the agreement among the parties regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the separations. Under the separation agreement, certain environmental and legal liabilities will be allocated among DuPont, Dow and Corteva. Those liabilities primarily related to DowDuPont’s specialty products businesses, materials science business and agriculture business will generally be retained or assumed by DuPont, Dow and Corteva, respectively, unless otherwise specifically allocated. 
With respect to environmental and legal liabilities from discontinued and/or divested operations and businesses, those of Historical Dow will be retained or assumed by Dow and those of Historical DuPont will be retained or assumed by Corteva or DuPont according to the terms of the separation agreement.
These liability allocations will be implemented through transfer or substitution, if possible, or indemnity.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, DowDuPont consummated a public underwritten offer of eight series of senior unsecured notes (the "DowDuPont Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $12.7 billion. (See the discussion of the DowDuPont Notes in Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations).
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This communication contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “see,” “will,” “would,” “target,” and similar expressions and variations or negatives of these words.

Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, including statements about the Intended Business Separations, the separations and distributions. Forward-looking statements, including those related to the DowDuPont’s ability to complete, or to make any filing or take any other action required to be taken to complete, the separations and distributions, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.
