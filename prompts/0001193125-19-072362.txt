Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a blank check company incorporated on April 25, 2016 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Initial Business Combination). 
 We intend to effectuate an Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the Public Offering) that closed on June 12, 2018 (the Closing Date) and the private placement of warrants to purchase shares of our Class A common stock (Private Placement Warrants) that closed on the Closing Date, and from additional issuances of, if any, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt. We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an Initial Business Combination with operating businesses, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete an Initial Business Combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We also have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenue to date. Based on our business activities, we are a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash. 
 Until the closing of the Public Offering, our only source of liquidity was an initial sale of shares (the Founder Shares) of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to an affiliate of our Sponsor and the proceeds of a promissory note (the Note) from an affiliate of our Sponsor, in the amount of $300,000, as well as the proceeds of a separate promissory note (the 2016 Note) from an affiliate of our Sponsor in 2016, in the amount of $300,000. The Note and the 2016 Note were repaid upon the closing of the Public Offering and in December 2016, respectively. 
 On June 12, 2018, we closed the Public Offering of 69,000,000 units (the Units), including 9,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional units in full, at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating proceeds to us of $690,000,000 before underwriting discounts and expenses. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of our company, $0.0001 par value per share, and onethird of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant excercisable for one share of Class A common stock (each, a Warrant and, collectively, the Warrants) at a price of $11.50 per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, we closed the private placement of an aggregate of 10,533,333 warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, to our Sponsor, at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant, generating proceeds of $15,800,000. Each Warrant and Private Placement Warrant will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Initial Business Combination and 12 months from the Closing Date, and will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of the Initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

 On the Closing Date, we placed $690,000,000 of proceeds (including $24,150,000 of deferred underwriting discount) from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants into a trust account at Wilmington Trust, N.A. (the Trust Account) and held $2,000,000 (net of offering expenses, other than underwriting discounts, paid upon the consummation of the Public Offering) of such proceeds outside the Trust Account. Of the funds held outside the Trust Account, $300,000 was used to repay the Note to our Sponsor, with the balance used or reserved for: offering and formation costs; legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses in connection with any business combinations; legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) continued listing fees; office space, administrative and support services; a reserve for liquidation expenses; and working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses (including franchise taxes net of anticipated interest income). 
 On July 27, 2018 we announced that the holders of our Units may elect to separately trade the Class A common stock and Warrants included in the Units commencing on July 30, 2018 on the NYSE under the symbols GSAH and GSAH WS, respectively. Those Units not separated will continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol GSAH.U. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our strategy is to identify and complete our Initial Business Combination with a company in the diversified industrial sector, which includes, among others, Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Services, Chemicals, Home & Building Products, Building & Construction, Capital Goods, Packaging and Supply Chain, that stands to benefit from Mr. Cotes experience and operating capabilities. We expect to distinguish ourselves with our ability to: 

 | Leverage our Extensive Network of Relationships to Create a Unique Pipeline of Acquisition Opportunities. We believe the combination of Mr. Cotes industry experience and our ability to access Goldman Sachs preeminent network of relationships with CEOs, founders, family owners and private equity sponsors will help us to identify and evaluate suitable target businesses that could benefit from Mr. Cotes operational and strategic expertise and from Goldman Sachs experience in structuring complex transactions and accessing capital for growth.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Bring Unique Rigor to the Process of Identifying and Acquiring a Private Business that will Ultimately be well Received in the Public Markets. We believe that Mr. Cotes strong M&A track record, together with GSAM extensive experience investing in both the private and public markets, will provide a distinct advantage for identifying, valuing and completing a business combination that will meet our investors expectations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Transform the Target Business and Create Value for Stockholders Following a Business Combination. Based on his track record, we believe that Mr. Cote will be able to add value post combination, especially to undermanaged, subscale or otherwise underperforming businesses, by applying strategies he has successfully employed in the past in order to accelerate revenue growth, improve profit margins and develop a results-oriented culture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the diversified industrial sector presents an attractive investment opportunity for us. Specifically, many industrial companies tend to be cash generative businesses that are growing at rates slightly higher than U.S. gross domestic product. In addition to these fundamentals, the sector is fragmented and contains a large number of privately-held and sponsor-owned businesses that we believe could benefit from Mr. Cotes experience of accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins, and improving capital allocation decision-making. In addition to independent privately- and sponsor-held middle market businesses, we believe many larger companies in the sector are in the process of evaluating their portfolios of businesses and reviewing candidates for potential divestitures, which we believe may also prove to be attractive business combination targets. We believe that many of these middle market and portfolio businesses are valued at between $1.0 and $5.0 billion, a range that is consistent with many of the targets we have focused on, although we may choose to pursue targets outside of this range whether within or outside of the diversified industrials sector.

 Businesses in the industrial sector are subject to special risks, including being subject to cyclical demand, fluctuations in customer demand, competition and consolidation, and volatility in costs of raw materials and energy commodities. For example, businesses in the industrial sector may be particularly susceptible to rises in the price of crude oil or natural gas. 
 Competitive Strengths 
 We believe Mr. Cotes reputation and GSAMs sourcing, valuation, diligence and execution capabilities will provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities from which to evaluate and select a business that will benefit from our expertise. Our competitive strengths include the following: 

 | Industry Leading Executive. We believe Mr. Cotes strong track record as an executive in the industrial industry will be viewed favorably by target businesses in need of professionalized management, improved operating processes and controls, better access to industry relationships and strategic planning.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Proprietary Sourcing Channels and Leading Industry Relationships. We believe the capabilities of Goldman Sachs Investment Banking Division, Ayco, GSAMs Private Credit Group and GSAMs Alternative Investments & Manager Selection Group, along with GSAMs and Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Managements reach to their clients, some of whom own or are associated with potential acquisition targets, will provide us with a differentiated pipeline of acquisition opportunities that would be difficult for other participants in the market to replicate. We expect these sourcing capabilities will be further bolstered by Mr. Cotes reputation and deep industry relationships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Investing Experience. We believe GSAMs deep experience investing in private and public markets, combined with Mr. Cotes track record of identifying and sourcing transactions in the diversified industrial sector, position us well to appropriately evaluate potential business combinations and select one that will be well received by the public markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Access to Goldman Sachs Capabilities Post-Initial Business Combination. We believe that potential sellers will be interested in a relationship with the Goldman Sachs platform and look favorably upon Goldman Sachs involvement in a transaction, including as a significant investor after an Initial Business Combination. Potential sellers may also have longstanding relationships with Goldman Sachs advisors and, therefore, may seek to engage with us to focus on value creation and to potentially facilitate access to capital markets for further growth and provide acquisition advice to implement roll-up strategies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment Criteria 
 We have developed the following high level, non-exclusive investment criteria that we will use to screen for and evaluate target businesses. We will seek to acquire a business that: 
 

 | A Leading Industry Position/Consolidation Opportunity in an Industrial Sector with Supportive Long-term Dynamics. We will seek to acquire a business that holds a leading position in an industry with attractive characteristics, such as having a differentiated product or service (especially if differentiated through technology). Specifically, we will seek to exclude businesses that (i) do not hold a strong position in the markets they serve, (ii) do not have a well-defined market, and (iii) are extremely sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Generates Stable Free Cash-Flow. We will seek to acquire a business that has historically generated, or has the near-term potential to generate, strong and sustainable free cash flow.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Would Benefit Uniquely from the Capabilities of Mr. Cote and Goldman Sachs. We will seek to acquire a business where the collective capabilities of Mr. Cote and Goldman Sachs can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 


 
 | Is Sourced through our Proprietary Channels. We do not expect to participate in broadly marketed processes, but rather will aim to leverage our extensive network to source our business combination.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Has a Committed and Capable Management Team. We will seek to acquire a business with a professional management team whose interests are aligned with those of our investors. Where necessary, we may also look to complement and enhance the capabilities of the target businesss management team by recruiting additional talent through Mr. Cotes and Goldman Sachs network of contacts.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Has the Potential to Grow, including through Further Acquisition Opportunities. We will seek to acquire a business that has the potential to grow organically and inorganically through additional acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as on other considerations, factors and criteria that our board of directors may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our Initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). 
 Our Acquisition Process 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with Goldman Sachs, our Sponsor, officers or directors, nor are we prohibited from doing so with a business that is affiliated with any GS Account. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with Goldman Sachs, our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or from an independent accounting firm, that such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 
 Members of our management team may directly or indirectly own our securities now or in the future, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination. 
 Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us. 
 While Goldman Sachs will not have any duty to offer acquisition opportunities to us, Goldman Sachs may become aware of a potential transaction that is an attractive opportunity for us, which it may decide to share with

  us. Goldman Sachs is a worldwide, full-service investment banking, broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization and a major participant in global financial markets. As such, Goldman Sachs provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high net-worth individuals. Goldman Sachs acts as an investment banker, research provider, investment adviser, financier, adviser, market maker, prime broker, derivatives dealer, lender, counterparty, agent, principal and investor. In those and other capacities, Goldman Sachs advises clients in all major markets and purchases, sells, holds and recommends a broad array of investments, including securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, indices, baskets and other financial instruments and products for its own account and for the accounts of clients, through client accounts and the relationships and products it sponsors, manages and advises. Goldman Sachs has direct and indirect interests in the global fixed income, currency, commodity, equities, bank loan and other markets, and the securities and issuers, in which we and GS Accounts may directly and indirectly invest. Additionally, we may, but are not required to, engage Goldman Sachs for services as a financial advisor in connection with identifying and investigating potential targets for our business combination. Conflicts may arise from Goldman Sachs sponsorship of our company, its provision of services both to us (including as a financial advisor) and to third-party clients, as well as from actions undertaken by Goldman Sachs for its own account. In performing services for other clients and also when acting for its own account, Goldman Sachs may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us. Any of Goldman Sachs financial market activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on us, and the interests of Goldman Sachs or its clients or counterparties may at times be adverse to ours. Please see Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance  Conflicts of Interest, for additional information regarding certain potential conflicts of interest relating to Goldman Sachs. 
 We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors, or Goldman Sachs, or policies applicable to Goldman Sachs, will materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our Initial Business Combination or we have failed to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months after the Closing Date. GSAM has agreed it will not sponsor any other special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act that is focused on one or more target businesses in the industrial sector until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our Initial Business Combination or we have failed to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months after the Closing Date. Other than the foregoing restrictions, neither Goldman Sachs nor any of its affiliates is restricted from participating in the formation of, and none of Goldman Sachs affiliates is restricted from becoming an officer or director of, any other special purpose acquisition company. 
 Sourcing of Potential Business Combination Targets 
 Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) manages and advises a substantial number of GS Accounts, including GS Accounts held by Goldman Sachs on a proprietary basis, GS Accounts held by Goldman Sachs personnel or clients and GS Accounts in which Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs personnel and clients have an interest. Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts may compete with us for acquisition opportunities that we may target for our Initial Business Combination. If Goldman Sachs or such other GS Accounts decide to pursue any such opportunity or Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) determines in its sole discretion not to offer such opportunity to us, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Goldman Sachs or by persons who may make decisions for us may be suitable for both us and for Goldman 
 
6 


  Sachs or other GS Accounts and may be directed to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or other third parties rather than to us. Although our Sponsor is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, we are not an investment advisory client of GSAM or any other business unit of Goldman Sachs (and we are not a GS Account). As such, none of GSAM, any other business unit of Goldman Sachs or any Goldman Sachs personnel (other than those who are members of our management team in their capacities as such) has any fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to our company, including, without limitation, to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. 
 Our management team, in their other endeavors (including any affiliation they may have with Goldman Sachs), may choose or be required to present potential business combinations or other transactions to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us. Certain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities (such as operating companies or investment vehicles) engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity or other transaction should be presented. In addition, investment opportunities sourced by GSAM or its personnel or presented to GSAM by other business units of Goldman Sachs or their personnel will be made available to us only after such opportunities have been offered to GS Accounts managed or advised by GSAM. To the extent that such GS Accounts decline to pursue any such opportunity, GSAM may in its sole discretion (but is not obligated to) offer all or any portion of such opportunity to us (or may instead offer all or any portion of such opportunity to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or third parties). Investment opportunities that are sourced by business units of Goldman Sachs other than GSAM or the personnel of such business units will not be made available to us, unless such opportunities are first presented to GSAM by such other business units or personnel. 
 We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with a company that is affiliated with Goldman Sachs, our Sponsor, officers or directors, nor are we prohibited from doing so with a business that is affiliated with any GS Account. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with Goldman Sachs, our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent and disinterested directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, that such Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 As discussed in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance  Conflicts of Interest, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us (including as described above). In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an affiliated joint acquisition. 
 Status as a Public Company 
 We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer target businesses an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
 Furthermore, once an Initial Business Combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the 
 
7 


  offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of such fiscal years second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 Additionally, we will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of such fiscal years second quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of such fiscal years second fiscal quarter. 
 Financial Position 
 With funds available for an Initial Business Combination in the amount of $672,012,083, as of December 31, 2018, assuming no redemptions and after payment of $24,150,000 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our Initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third-party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
Effecting our Initial Business Combination 
 We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our Initial Business Combination. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the Trust Account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the Trust Account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
 We may seek to raise additional funds in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination through a private offering of equity securities (including pursuant to a specified future issuance) or debt securities or loans (including from Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or their respective affiliates), and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offerings or loans rather than using the amounts held in the Trust Account. 
 
8 


 In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the Trust Account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately (including pursuant to a specified future issuance) or through loans (including from Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or their respective affiliates) in connection with our Initial Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 
 Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination 
 The NYSE rules require that our Initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not currently intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination, although there is no assurance that will be the case. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If our Initial Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. There is no basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination. 
 We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our Initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in our Initial Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. 
 To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 
 In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, 
 
9 


  inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. 
 The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 
 Lack of Business Diversification 
 For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our Initial Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. 
 Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our Initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
 

 | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our Initial Business Combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Targets Management Team 
 Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our Initial Business Combination with that business, our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our Initial Business Combination, it is highly unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
 We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our Initial Business Combination. 
 Following our Initial Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
 Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination 
 We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of 
 
10 


  the types of Initial Business Combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 
 

Type of Transaction | WhetherStockholderApproval isRequired
Purchase of assets | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | No 
Merger of the company with a target | Yes 

 Under the NYSEs listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our Initial Business Combination if, for example: 
 

 | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) shares of common stock that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then outstanding;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial securityholders; or

 | the issuance or potential issuance will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which stockholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: 
 

 | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine stockholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek stockholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the expected cost of holding a stockholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | the risk that the stockholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | other time and budget constraints of the company; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


 | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Permitted Purchases of our Securities 
 In the event we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our Initial Business Combination. There is no limit on the number of shares such persons may purchase. However, we are not aware of any current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and we are not aware of any formulated terms or conditions for any such transactions. In the event our initial stockholders, directors, officers, 
 
11 


  advisors or any of their respective affiliates determine to make any such purchases at the time of a stockholder vote relating to our Initial Business Combination, such purchases could have the effect of influencing the vote necessary to approve such transaction. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase public shares in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to (1) refrain from purchasing securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and (2) to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 
 In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates purchase public shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our Initial Business Combination, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our Initial Business Combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
 The purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our Initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our Initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
 In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
 Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors and/or any of their respective affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our Initial Business Combination. To the extent that our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the Trust Account or vote against our Initial Business Combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their respective affiliates will purchase shares only if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
 Any purchases by our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their respective affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will need to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which

12 


  is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our Sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their respective affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of common stock if such purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. 
 Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. At completion of the business combination, we will be required to purchase any public shares properly delivered for redemption and not withdrawn. The amount in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2018 was $10.09 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to our public stockholders who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
 We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either: (1) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination; or (2) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would typically require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other reasons. 
 If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Initial Business Combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the Initial Business Combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Upon the public announcement of our Initial Business Combination, we and our Sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
 
13 


 In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such Initial Business Combination. 
 If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 
 

 | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 We expect that a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration. 
 In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the Initial Business Combination. 
 If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Initial Business Combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors will count towards this quorum and have agreed to vote any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in favor of our Initial Business Combination. These quorum and voting thresholds and agreements, may make it more likely that we will consummate our Initial Business Combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination. 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (1) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners; (2) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes; or (3) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly 
 
14 


  submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
 Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our Public Offering, without our prior consent, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our Sponsor or its affiliates to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holders shares are not purchased by us or our Sponsor or its affiliates at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Initial Business Combination. 
 Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 
We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, rather than simply voting against the Initial Business Combination at the holders option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, the tender offer period will be not less than 20 business days and, in the case of a stockholder vote, a final proxy statement would be mailed to public stockholders at least 10 days prior to the stockholder vote. However, we expect that a draft proxy statement would be made available to such stockholders well in advance of such time, providing additional notice of redemption if we conduct redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 
 There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through The Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of 
 
15 


  whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
 The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an Initial Business Combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
 Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our Initial Business Combination. 
 If our Initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 
 If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the Closing Date. 
 Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 24 months from the Closing Date to complete our Initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within such period, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our Warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the 24-month time period. 
 
16 


 Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Founder Shares held by them if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date. However, if our initial stockholders or any of our officers and directors acquires public shares after our Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our Initial Business Combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 
 Our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SECs penny stock rules). 
 We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts held outside the Trust Account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the Trust Account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
 If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the Trust Account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the Trust Account and any tax payments or expenses for the dissolution of the trust, the per share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Please see Item1A. Risk Factors  If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share. Under Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims. 
 Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the Trust Account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that 
 
17 


  refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where we are unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. 
 In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (1) $10.00 per public share or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsors only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for our Initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our Initial Business Combination, and our public stockholders would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. None of our officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
 In the event that the proceeds in the Trust Account are reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in certain instances. For example, the cost of such legal action may be deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or the independent directors may determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. 
 We will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Our Sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our Trust Account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
 Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our 
 
18 


  public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
 Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date, we will: (1) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (2) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law; and (3) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
 Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. 
 As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the Trust Account is remote. Further, our Sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the Trust Account are not reduced below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
 If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our 
 
19 


  bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 
 Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the Closing Date or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the Initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the Trust Account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, a stockholders voting in connection with our Initial Business Combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the Trust Account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 
 Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 
 Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that if we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that: 

 | prior to the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, we shall either: (1) seek stockholder approval of our Initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable); or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | we will consummate our Initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination at a duly held stockholders meeting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | if our Initial Business Combination is not consummated within 24 months from the Closing Date, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prior to our Initial Business Combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (1) receive funds from the Trust Account or (2) vote on any Initial Business Combination.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our Initial Business Combination, our amended and restated 
 
20 


  certificate of incorporation will provide that we may consummate our Initial Business Combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting. 
 Competition 
 In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding Warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination. 
Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to Goldman Sachs 
 Our Sponsor is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs is a worldwide, full-service investment banking, broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization and a major participant in global financial markets. As such, Goldman Sachs provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high net-worth individuals. Goldman Sachs acts as an investment banker, research provider, investment adviser, financier, adviser, market maker, prime broker, derivatives dealer, lender, counterparty, agent, principal and investor. In those and other capacities, Goldman Sachs advises clients in all major markets and purchases, sells, holds and recommends a broad array of investments, including securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, indices, baskets and other financial instruments and products, for its own account and for the accounts of clients, through client accounts and the relationships and products it sponsors, manages and advises. Goldman Sachs has direct and indirect interests in the global fixed income, currency, commodity, equities, bank loan and other markets, and the securities and issuers, in which we and GS Accounts may directly and indirectly invest. While Goldman Sachs will not have any duty to offer acquisition opportunities to us, Goldman Sachs may become aware of a potential transaction that is an attractive opportunity for us, which it may or may not decide to share with us. In addition, we may, but are not required to, engage Goldman Sachs for services as a financial advisor in connection with identifying and investigating potential targets for our business combination. If we engage Goldman Sachs for such services, Goldman Sachs may provide competitive and preferential rates to us for such services. Raanan A. Agus, one of our directors is also currently associated with Goldman Sachs and will not be independent of Goldman Sachs (although there is no assurance that Mr. Agus will remain associated with Goldman Sachs). 
 As described in the preceding paragraph, Goldman Sachs is engaged in other businesses and has interests other than its sponsorship of and related interests in our company. We will not be entitled to compensation related to such businesses. These activities and interests of Goldman Sachs may include potential multiple advisory, transactional, and financial and other interests in securities, instruments and companies, including us, or that may be, directly or indirectly, purchased or sold by us. 
 Conflicts may arise from Goldman Sachs sponsorship of our company, its provision of services both to us (including as a financial advisor) and to third-party clients, as well as from actions undertaken by Goldman Sachs for its own account. In performing services for other clients and also when acting for its own account, Goldman Sachs may take commercial steps which may have an adverse effect on us. Any of Goldman Sachs 
 
21 


  financial market activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on us, and the interests of Goldman Sachs or its clients or counterparties may at times be adverse to ours. 
 The following discussion describes certain potential conflicts of interest that exist between Goldman Sachs and our company. These are considerations of which investors in our company should be aware, and which may cause conflicts that could disadvantage us. They are not, and are not intended to be, a complete enumeration or explanation of all of the potential conflicts of interest that may arise. Present and future activities of Goldman Sachs in addition to those described in this  Certain Potential Conflicts of Interest Relating to Goldman Sachs may give rise to additional conflicts of interest. Dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and new and different types of conflicts may subsequently arise. There can be no assurance that Goldman Sachs will be able to resolve all conflicts in a manner that is favorable to us, and any such conflicts may have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to consummate an Initial Business Combination. 
 Limitations on Our Access to Investment Opportunities Sourced by GSAM and Other Business Units of Goldman Sachs 
 Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) manages and advises a substantial number of GS Accounts, including GS Accounts held by Goldman Sachs on a proprietary basis, GS Accounts held by Goldman Sachs personnel or clients and GS Accounts in which Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs personnel and clients have an interest. Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts may compete with us for acquisition opportunities that we may target for the Initial Business Combination. If Goldman Sachs or such other GS Accounts decide to pursue any such opportunity or Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) determines in its sole discretion not to offer such opportunity to us, we may be precluded from procuring such opportunities. In addition, investment ideas generated within Goldman Sachs or by persons who may make decisions for us may be suitable for both us and for Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts and may be directed to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or other third parties rather than to us. Prospective investors should note that, although our Sponsor is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, we are not an investment advisory client of GSAM or any other business unit of Goldman Sachs (and we are not a GS Account). As such, none of GSAM, any other business unit of Goldman Sachs or any Goldman Sachs personnel (other than those who are members of our management team in their capacities as such) has any fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to our company, including, without limitation, to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. 
 Our management team, in their other endeavors (including any affiliation they may have with Goldman Sachs), may choose or be required to present potential business combinations or other transactions to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or third parties, before they present such opportunities to us. Please see Item 1A. Risk FactorsCertain of our officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity or other transaction should be presented. In addition, investment opportunities sourced by GSAM or its personnel or presented to GSAM by other business units of Goldman Sachs or their personnel will be made available to us only after such opportunities have been offered to GS Accounts managed or advised by GSAM. To the extent that such GS Accounts decline to pursue any such opportunity, GSAM may in its sole discretion (but is not obligated to) offer all or any portion of such opportunity to us (or may instead offer all or any portion of such opportunity to Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or third parties). Investment opportunities that are sourced by business units of Goldman Sachs other than GSAM or the personnel of such business units will not be made available to us, unless such opportunities are first presented to GSAM by such other business units or personnel. 
 Goldman Sachs and GSAMs Activities on Behalf of GS Accounts; Our Company is Not an Investment Advisory Client of GSAM or Any Other Business Unit of Goldman Sachs and is Not a GS Account 
 As described above, Goldman Sachs engages in a variety of activities in the global financial markets. The extent of Goldman Sachs activities in the global financial markets, including, without limitation, in its capacity as an 
 
22 


  investment banker, research provider, investment adviser, financier, adviser, market maker, prime broker, derivatives dealer, lender, counterparty, agent, principal and investor, as well as in other capacities, may have potential adverse effects on us or businesses that we seek to acquire. Goldman Sachs and its personnel, when acting in these or other capacities, may advise on transactions, make investment decisions or recommendations, provide differing investment views or have views with respect to research or valuations that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, our interests and activities or those of businesses that we seek to acquire. Transactions by, advice to and activities of Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts (including with respect to investment decisions, voting and the enforcement of rights) may involve us or businesses that we seek to acquire. For example, Goldman Sachs may be engaged to provide advice to a GS Account that is considering entering into a transaction with us, and Goldman Sachs may advise the GS Account not to pursue the transaction with us, or otherwise in connection with a potential transaction provide advice to the GS Account that would be adverse to us. Moreover, Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts who own our securities or securities of businesses that we seek to acquire and may vote on or take or refrain from taking actions with respect to such securities in ways that may be disadvantageous to us or our public stockholders. 
 Prospective investors should note that, although our Sponsor is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, our company is not an investment advisory client of GSAM or any other business unit of Goldman Sachs (and is not a GS Account). As such, none of GSAM, any other business unit of Goldman Sachs or any Goldman Sachs personnel (other than those who are members of our management team in their capacities as such) has any fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to our company, including, without limitation, to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware. Our management team is responsible for making all acquisition and other decisions on our behalf. Decisions made by our management team may differ from those by Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) on behalf of GS Accounts and may compete with, affect, differ from, conflict with, or involve timing different from, advice given to, or investment or voting decisions made by GSAM for GS Accounts. Neither GSAM nor any other business unit of Goldman Sachs will have any contractual or other obligation or duty to make available to us any information regarding its trading activities, strategies or views, or the activities, strategies or views, including those used for Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts. In the event that Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts hold securities of a business that we seek to acquire, Goldman Sachs, on behalf of itself or such other GS Accounts, may implement an investment decision ahead of, or contemporaneously with, or behind similar investment decisions made by us. The relative timing for the implementation of investment decisions for Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts, on the one hand, and by us, on the other hand, may disadvantage us. 
 Although our company may from time to time have access to certain fundamental analyses and proprietary technical models developed by Goldman Sachs and its personnel, Goldman Sachs and its personnel have no obligation or other duty to make such analyses and models available to us and, in certain cases, may be prohibited from doing so. In addition, Goldman Sachs has no obligation or other duty to seek information or to make available to or share with our company any information, investment strategies, opportunities or ideas known to Goldman Sachs personnel or developed or used in connection with other clients or activities and, in certain cases, they may be prohibited from doing so. Goldman Sachs and certain of its personnel, including those who are involved with our company, may be in possession of information not available to all Goldman Sachs personnel, and such personnel may act on the basis of such information in connection with the activities relating to Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts in ways that are adverse to our company. 
 Goldman Sachs is often engaged as a financial advisor, or to provide financing, to corporations and other entities and their directors and managers in connection with the sale of those entities, their assets or their subsidiaries. Sellers generally require Goldman Sachs to act exclusively on their behalf and / or for other reasons, we may be precluded in many instances from attempting to acquire securities of the business being sold or otherwise participate as a buyer in the transaction. Goldman Sachs also represents potential buyers businesses. Goldman Sachs may be incentivized to direct an opportunity to one of these buyers or to form a consortium with such buyers to bid for the opportunity, thereby eliminating or reducing the investment opportunity available to us.

 Lending and Loan Syndication; Investments in Different Parts of an Issuers Capital Structure 
 Goldman Sachs is engaged in the business of making, underwriting and syndicating senior and other loans to corporate and other borrowers, and may seek (but is not obligated) to provide these services to our company or businesses that we seek to acquire. For instance, we or such businesses may borrow money from Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts and Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts may (but are not obligated to) arrange or underwrite bank or high-yield financing used by us or such businesses. In addition, Goldman Sachs is the sponsor of (and some of the GS Accounts are) investment partnerships specializing in senior secured loan investments and mezzanine investments, which may (but are not obligated to) make senior secured loan and / or mezzanine investments in us or such businesses. The interest, fees and other compensation received by Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts in connection with these activities will not be shared with our company or our public stockholders. 
 Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) or other GS Accounts may invest in or extend credit to different parts of our capital structure or the capital structure of businesses that we seek to acquire. As a result, Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) or other GS Accounts may take actions that are directly adverse to us, our public stockholders or such businesses. In addition, Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) may advise GS Accounts with respect to different parts of our capital structure or the capital structure of businesses that we seek to acquire, classes of our securities that are senior to our common stock or classes of such businesses securities that are senior to the securities of such businesses owned by us. Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) may pursue rights, provide advice or engage in other activities, or refrain from pursuing rights, providing advice or engaging in other activities, on behalf of itself or GS Accounts with respect to our company or businesses that we seek to acquire, and such actions (or refraining from action) may have a material adverse effect on us or such businesses. 
 For example, in the event that Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) or a GS Account holds loans, securities or other positions in our capital structure that ranks senior in preference to our common stock, and our company experiences financial or operational challenges, Goldman Sachs (including GSAM), acting on behalf of itself or the GS Account, may seek a liquidation, reorganization or restructuring of our company, or terms in connection with the foregoing, that may have an adverse effect on or otherwise conflict with the interests of our other investors, including public stockholders. In the event our company becomes financially distressed, we may undertake a restructuring and, as a result, the equity interests in our company may be extinguished or substantially diluted while the creditors may receive a recovery of some or all of the amounts due to them and may receive equity in the company. In this regard, in the event that Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts are holders of our debt and our company is subject to a restructuring, Goldman Sachs or such other GS Accounts may recover amounts owed to them while the interests of public stockholders may be extinguished or substantially diluted. In addition, in connection with lending arrangements involving our company, Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts may seek to exercise its creditors rights under the applicable loan agreement or other document, which may be detrimental to our equity holders, including our public stockholders. Similar considerations will apply in the event that Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts hold loans, securities or other positions in the capital structure of businesses that we seek to acquire that rank senior in preference to the securities of such businesses acquired by us. 
 Goldman Sachs May Act in Multiple Commercial Capacities 
 To the extent permitted by applicable law, Goldman Sachs may act as broker, dealer, agent, counterparty, lender or advisor or in other commercial capacities for us or businesses that we seek to acquire. Prospective investors should not rely on, or have any expectation, that Goldman Sachs will act in any such capacities. Goldman Sachs may be entitled to compensation in connection with the provision of such services, and we will not be entitled to any such compensation. Goldman Sachs will have an interest in obtaining fees and other compensation in connection with such services that are favorable to Goldman Sachs, and in connection with providing such services may take commercial steps in its own interest, or may advise the parties to which it is providing services, or take other actions, any of which may negatively affect us. For example, Goldman Sachs may require 
 
24 


  repayment of all or part of a loan made to us or to a business we seek to acquire, which could cause us or such business to default or be required to liquidate assets more rapidly, which could adversely affect the value of our company or such business. Goldman Sachs may also advise us or a business we seek to acquire to make changes to our capital structure or the capital structure of such business, the result of which would be a reduction in the value of our securities or the securities issued by such business. Actions taken or advised to be taken by Goldman Sachs in connection with other types of transactions may also result in adverse consequences for our company or a business we seek to acquire. In addition, due to its access to and knowledge of funds, markets and securities based on its prime brokerage and other businesses, Goldman Sachs (on behalf of itself or other GS Accounts) may make decisions based on information or take (or refrain from taking) actions with respect to us or businesses that we seek to acquire in a manner that may be adverse to us. Goldman Sachs may also provide various services to us or to businesses that we seek to acquire, which may result in fees, compensation and remuneration, as well as other benefits, to Goldman Sachs, enhance Goldman Sachs relationships with various parties, facilitate additional business development and enable Goldman Sachs to obtain additional business and generate additional revenue. In addition, while it has no obligation or other duty to do so, Goldman Sachs, subject to applicable restrictions on sale, may act as a broker for public stockholders who are interested in selling their units, shares or warrants. 
 Subject to applicable law, we may acquire a business affiliated with or advised by Goldman Sachs or in which Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or their respective affiliates have an equity, debt or other interest, or to engage in investment transactions that may result in Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or such affiliates being relieved of obligations or otherwise divested of investments. For example, we may acquire a company affiliated with Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts, or purchase securities from, a business that uses the proceeds to repay loans made by Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts. These activities by us may enhance the profitability of Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts with respect to their investment in and activities relating to such companies. 
 In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may invest in money market funds sponsored, managed or advised by Goldman Sachs. In connection with any such investments, we generally will pay all advisory, administrative or Rule 12b-1 fees applicable to the investment. In such circumstances, as well as in all other circumstances in which Goldman Sachs receives any fees or other compensation in any form relating to the provision of services, no accounting or repayment to our company will be required. 
 Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) may create, write, sell, issue, invest in or act as placement agent or distributor of derivative instruments related to us, or with respect to our underlying securities or assets, or which may be otherwise based on or seek to replicate or hedge our performance. Such derivative transactions, and any associated hedging activity, may differ from and be adverse to our interests. Activities in respect of derivative transactions, and any associated hedging activity, may occur as a result of Goldman Sachs adjustment in assessment of our business based on various considerations, and Goldman Sachs will not be under any obligation or other duty to provide notice to us in respect of any such adjustment in assessment. 
 Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) or other GS Accounts may also have different rights in respect of a business that we seek to acquire, or invest in different classes of securities issued by a business that we seek to acquire that have different rights, including, without limitation, with respect to liquidity. The determination to exercise such rights by Goldman Sachs (including GSAM) on behalf of itself or certain GS Accounts may have an adverse effect us. 
 Goldman Sachs may make loans to clients or enter into margin, asset-based or other credit facilities or similar transactions with clients that may (or may not) be secured by publicly or privately held securities or other assets, including by a clients assets or interests other than our units, common stock and warrants. Some of these borrowers may be public or private companies, or founders, officers or shareholders in companies in which Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts (directly or indirectly) invest, and such loans may be secured by securities of such companies, which may be the same as, pari passu with, or more senior or junior to, interests held (directly 
 
25 


  or indirectly) by Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts. In connection with its rights as lender, Goldman Sachs may act to protect its own commercial interest and may take actions that adversely affect the borrower, including by liquidating or causing the liquidation of securities on behalf of a borrower or foreclosing and liquidating such securities in Goldman Sachs own name. Such actions may adversely affect us (e.g., if a large position in our common stock is liquidated, among the other potential adverse consequences, the value of our common stock may decline rapidly). In addition, Goldman Sachs may make loans to our public stockholders or enter into similar transactions that are secured by a pledge of, or mortgage over, a public stockholders units, common stock and/or warrants, which would provide Goldman Sachs with the right to take possession such securities in the event that such public stockholder defaults on its obligations. These transactions may be significant and may be made without notice to the public securityholders. 
 Goldman Sachs may have business relationships with, and purchase, or distribute or sell, services or products from or to, distributors, consultants and others who have a relationship with us or businesses that we seek to acquire. As a result, those persons and institutions may have conflicts associated with their dealings with us. 
 Goldman Sachs may, in its discretion, recommend that we, or a business we seek to acquire, have ongoing business dealings, arrangements or agreements with persons who are former employees of Goldman Sachs or are otherwise associated with a GS Account investor, portfolio company, or service provider. We, or a business we seek to acquire, may bear, directly or indirectly, the costs of such dealings, arrangements or agreements. These recommendations, and recommendations relating to continuing any such dealings, arrangements or agreements, may pose conflicts of interest due to Goldman Sachs relationships with such former employees or persons otherwise associated with an investor in a GS Account, portfolio company or service provider. 
 Conflicts Resulting from Our Company Being a Public Company 
 Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts may directly or indirectly trade our securities. Such trading activities may adversely affect us. For example, Goldman Sachs or other GS Accounts may establish a short position in our securities. This short position may result in the impairment of the price of our securities or may be designed to profit from a decline in the price of such securities. 
 Furthermore, Goldman Sachs may perform research and other analysis in respect of our company. Any views expressed by Goldman Sachs in connection with such research and analysis may be negative with respect to, or result in trading strategies that have a negative impact on the market for, us and our securities. 
 GSAM has adopted a Code of Ethics under Rule 204A-1 of the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, designed to provide that personnel of GSAM, and certain additional Goldman Sachs personnel who support GSAM, comply with applicable federal securities laws and place the interests of clients first in conducting personal securities transactions. GSAMs Code of Ethics imposes certain restrictions on securities transactions in the personal accounts of covered persons to help avoid conflicts of interest. Subject to the limitations of GSAMs Code of Ethics, covered persons (including those who are members of our management team) may buy and sell securities or other investments for their personal accounts, including investments in us, and may also take positions that are the same as, different from, or made at different times than, positions taken (directly or indirectly) by us. 
 Not all Members of Our Management Team are Independent of Goldman Sachs 
 Our management team is responsible for the management of our affairs. Raanan A. Agus, one of our directors is currently associated with Goldman Sachs and will not be independent of Goldman Sachs (although there is no assurance that Mr. Agus will remain associated with Goldman Sachs). As a result, Mr. Agus has, and in the future may have additional, fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, in addition to his obligations and duties as a member of our management team, including as a result of his association with Goldman Sachs, which could result in potential conflicts of interest. Additionally, all Goldman Sachs personnel are subject to firm-wide 
 
26 


  policies and procedures regarding confidential and proprietary information, information barriers, private investments, outside business activities and personal trading. Please see Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance  Conflicts of Interest for additional information regarding conflicts of interest relating to our management team. 
 Affiliated Joint Acquisition 
 In addition, we may, at our option, pursue an affiliated joint acquisition opportunity with Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or their respective affiliates. Any such parties may co-invest with us in the target business at the time of the Initial Business Combination, or we could raise additional proceeds to complete the acquisition by making a specified future issuance to any such parties, which may give rise to certain conflicts of interest. 
 We will pursue an affiliated joint acquisition if we believe such transaction will help us consummate a specific initial business combination or would be beneficial to the post-business combination company. None of Goldman Sachs, other GS Accounts or any of their respective affiliates has any current commitments to engage in such transactions, and we are not aware of any such parties having any plans or intentions to do so. We have also not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions, and the amount and other terms and conditions of any such transactions would be determined at the time thereof. 
 Holders of any shares of capital stock issued in an affiliated joint acquisition prior to the Initial Business Combination, will not be entitled to (1) receive funds from the trust account or (2) vote on any initial business combination. Additionally, such additional securities will not be entitled to vote on amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, any such issuance would dilute the interest of our stockholders. See Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or preferred stock to complete the Initial Business Combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of the Initial Business Combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon the conversion of the Class B common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of the Initial Business Combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks. Additionally, to the extent any affiliated joint acquisition involves the issuance of notes or other debt securities or we otherwise incur debt in connection therewith, such transaction could have negative effects on us, including those described in Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders investment in us. 
 If the Initial Business Combination involves an affiliated joint acquisition, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of such affiliated joint acquisition and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek stockholder approval of such affiliated joint acquisition. 
 Selection of Service Providers 
 We expect to engage service providers (including attorneys and consultants) that may also provide services to Goldman Sachs and other GS Accounts. We intend to select these service providers based on a number of factors, including expertise and experience, knowledge of related or similar products, quality of service, reputation in the marketplace, relationships with GSAM, Goldman Sachs or others, and price. These service providers may have business, financial, or other relationships with Goldman Sachs, including being a portfolio company of GSAM, Goldman Sachs, or a GS Account. These relationships may or may not influence our selection of these service providers. In such circumstances, there may be a conflict of interest between us, on the one hand, and GSAM, Goldman Sachs, and GS Accounts (or their portfolio companies), on the other hand, if we determine not to engage or continue to engage these service providers. The service providers selected by us may charge different rates to different recipients based on the specific services provided, the personnel providing the services, or other factors. As a result, the rates paid with respect to these service providers by us, on the one hand, may be more or less favorable than the rates paid by Goldman Sachs, on the other hand.

 Sponsor Indemnity 
 Our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below: (1) $10.00 per public share; or (2) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We have not independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our Sponsors only assets are securities of our company and, therefore, our Sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. We have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such obligations. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. We believe the likelihood of our Sponsor having to indemnify the Trust Account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
Employees 
 We currently have one officer and do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time that any such person will devote in any time period to our company will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
 Our Units, Class A common stock and Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. Our annual, quarterly and current resports, and any amendments to any of those reports, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable through our corporate website address at www.GSacquisition.com. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the uniform resource locators, or URLs, for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only. 
 We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
 We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), or International Financing Reporting Standards, as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the 
 
28 


  standards of the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such financial statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our Initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
 We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal years second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
