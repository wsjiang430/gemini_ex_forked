General and Historical Overview of Our Business

The Company was formed on December 9, 2004 under the laws of the State of Nevada as an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties in the United States and Canada. In March of 2014, the Company began its entry into the bioscience and alternative health and wellness business and discontinued its involvement in the oil and gas business in November 2014. In May 2016, the Company also commenced out-licensing its patented DehydraTECH™ technology (the “Technology”) for improved delivery of bioactive compounds that promotes healthy ingestion methods, lower overall dosing and higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. The Company has its office in Kelowna, BC, Canada.

Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX under the symbol “LXRP” and on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the symbol “LXX”.

In 2014, the Company changed its business direction to enter into the hemp oil-based food supplement industry in the US and the legal medical marijuana industry in Canada via a 49% interest in a joint venture arrangement. The 49% interest was subsequently sold on June 26, 2015 for $4,900 by the Company to focus on its food sciences activities.

The Company’s food sciences activities include the development of our proprietary nutrient infusion technologies for the production of functional foods, and the production of enhanced food products under our consumer product brands, ViPova™, Lexaria Energy™, TurboCBD™ and ChrgD+TM. The Company’s patented lipid nutrient infusion DehydraTECH technology is believed to improve taste, rapidity and delivery of bioactive compounds that include cannabinoids, vitamins, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), nicotine and other molecules compared to what is possible without lipophilic enhancement technology. This can allow for lower overall dosing requirements and/or higher effectiveness in active molecule delivery. 

We maintain our registered agent’s office and our U.S. business office at Nevada Agency and Transfer Company, 50 West Liberty, Suite 880, Reno, Nevada 89501. Our telephone number is (755) 322-0626.

Our Current Business 
Our business plan is currently focused on the development of strategic partnerships with licensees for our patented Technology in exchange for up front and/or staged licensing fees over time. Secondarily and more generally, we continue to investigate national and international opportunities for development and distribution of the Company’s enhanced functional food and supplement product offerings; to investigate expansions and additions to our intellectual property portfolio; and, to search for additional opportunities in alternative health sectors. This includes the acquisition or development of intellectual property if and when we believe it is advisable to do so. 

Our current patent portfolio includes patent family grants relating to: Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to Lexaria’s method of improving bioavailability and taste, and the use of DehydraTECH technology as a delivery platform for a wide variety of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) encompassing all cannabinoids including tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”); fat soluble vitamins; Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (“NSAIDs”) pain medications; and nicotine. 

Lexaria hopes to reduce other common but less healthy administration methods, such as smoking, as it embraces the benefits of its technology for public health. The Company is aggressively pursuing patent protection in national jurisdictions around the world. The Company currently has more than 55 patent applications pending worldwide and, due to the complexity of pursuing patent protection, the quantity of patent applications will vary continuously as each application advances or stalls. Lexaria is also filing new patent applications for novel new discoveries that arise from the Company’s R&D programs and, due to the inherent unpredictability of scientific discovery, it is not possible to predict if or how often such new applications might be filed.

During the past fiscal year the Company experienced the following significant corporate developments:

On September 7, 2018, the Company announced additions to its patent portfolio with three new Australian patents granted to Lexaria by the Australian Patent Office. The three Australian patents are projected to expire on June 10, 2035. 

The USPTO also issued two new Notices of Allowance for pending patent applications and the Company announced the grants on October 16, 2018. The two new patents are related to certain cannabinoid infused beverage compositions utilizing Lexaria’s proprietary DehydraTECH process. Newly granted patent numbers US 10,103,225 B2 and US 10,084,044 B2 provide protection for compositions as well as methods for making the compositions, each of which include the use of both non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (“CBD”) and also psychoactive cannabinoids such as THC. The Company holds fourteen issued patents within its first patent family, “Food and Beverage Compositions Infused With Lipophilic Active Agents and Methods of Use Thereof”, one in the second patent family “Methods for Formulating Orally Ingestible Compositions Comprising Lipophilic Active Agents”, and one in the third patent family “Stable Ready-to-Drink Beverage Compositions Comprising Lipophilic Active Agents” that significantly strengthen Lexaria’s intellectual property claims in the US and Australia. Of note, issuance of these patents in the second and third patent families represents the first time the Company has been granted claims for use of its technology in connection with the treatment of specific diseases and medical conditions affecting humans, which the Company believes will prove to be of significance to the pharmaceutical industry sector as it further develops and grows. We continue to pursue claims in corresponding pending applications around the world. 

On September 7, 2018, the Company announced the filing of a new strategic patent application. The new provisional patent application is entitled “Lipophilic Active Agent Infused Tobacco Leaves and/or Tobacco Materials and Methods of Use Thereof”. This application represents Lexaria’s tenth patent family and expands the applicability of the already-patented DehydraTECH process to impart benefits to tobacco leaves that may be utilized to deliver compounds that may or may not include nicotine.

On October 10, 2018, the Company announced completed the creation of four wholly-owned subsidiary companies. This new corporate structure more suitably reflects the distinct customer bases and business applications for each subsidiary, thereby allowing the Company to focus its future research and consider financing structures and industry partnerships specifically optimized to each. 


· | Lexaria CanPharm ULC, a Canadian company focused on providing DehydraTECH technology and other enhancements to the global cannabis industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lexaria Nicotine LLC, a US company with a global license to provide DehydraTECH technology to the global nicotine and tobacco industries. 
· | Lexaria Hemp Corp., a US company globally licensed to provide DehydraTECH to the rapidly growing hemp-based foods and supplements industries.
· | Lexaria Pharmaceutical Corp., a US company globally empowered to license DehydraTECH to the large and diverse pharmaceutical sectors. 


On November 13, 2018, the Company announced the launch of ChrgD+, a water-soluble, ready-mix hemp supplement powder packet formulation designed to be added to any drink. Lexaria engaged Cultivating Wellness Inc., a California-based brand development and distribution company, to create the ChrgD+ premium brand. Cultivating Wellness’ distribution network reaches tens of thousands of retail buyers in c-stores, grocery chains, specialty retail, and national accounts. We subsequently launched our retail e-commerce website for public consumers in June of 2019. 

On November 26, 2018, the Company announced it submitted a research application under Health Canada’s Cannabis Tracking and Licensing System for the operation of a Kelowna-based R&D laboratory within Lexaria’s new head office. The laboratory’s creation enhances Lexaria’s ability to formulate for analytical purposes, various products that may contain cannabinoids or other controlled substances. Experimental work on nicotine formulations, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamins and other bioactive compounds of interest began soon after completion of lab construction with work on cannabinoid related formulations occurring after receipt of Lexaria’s research license. Bringing formulation work in-house enables the Company to expand its work schedules while reducing costs and development timelines.

On January 15, 2019, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Lexaria Nicotine LLC (“Lexaria Nicotine”) and Altria Ventures Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”), executed definitive agreements to pursue innovation in oral, reduced risk nicotine consumer products using Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology. Altria is funding a milestone-based research & development program (“R&D Program”) in exchange for a minority equity interest in Lexaria Nicotine and certain DehydraTECH license rights. Altria will provide initial funding of $1 million, with the option for additional funding of up to $12 million total through multiple phased private financings. Altria was granted a license to use Lexaria Bioscience’s DehydraTECH technology for oral nicotine delivery forms on an exclusive basis in the United States and a non-exclusive basis elsewhere globally. Altria will pay Lexaria Nicotine a royalty on revenue generated from the sale of all nicotine products containing DehydraTECH, until such time it may acquire 100% ownership in Lexaria Nicotine. Altria will initially have the right to appoint one of the seven managers of Lexaria Nicotine and, through the additional phased investments, may have the right to appoint up to three of the seven managers. Altria has the option to acquire 100% ownership interest in Lexaria Nicotine commensurate with then-current fair market value. Altria gained no rights of ownership to Lexaria Bioscience and has no rights of board of director representation on Lexaria Bioscience

On February 21, 2019, the Company announced additional findings upon completion of further data analyses from its 2018 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded European human clinical study that evaluated TurboCBD, the Company’s proprietary, DehydraTECH powered, CBD fortified hemp-oil capsule. A single 90mg dose of TurboCBD provided evidence of lower blood pressure; higher blood flow to the brain; faster delivery onset of CBD into the bloodstream; and, larger quantities of CBD within the blood compared to a single 90mg dose of generic CBD.

Key metabolic and hemodynamic performance findings linked to bioavailability enhancements were revealed in the study, which compared a 90 mg dose of Lexaria’s TurboCBD to a 90 mg dose without Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology (the “positive control”) as well as a placebo, as follows:


· | Analysis of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at peak blood levels of CBD achieved with Lexaria’s TurboCBD demonstrated a significant reduction in MAP compared to placebo (95% CI; p=0.027). This finding was not observed with the dose-matched positive control formulation for which there was no significant decrease in MAP compared to placebo (95% CI; p=0.625);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Cerebral perfusion was also analysed by an index of conductance in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The findings revealed that Lexaria’s TurboCBD caused the greatest increase in MCA conductance relative to both the positive control formulation and placebo (95% CI; p=0.017 and P=0.002 respectively); 


Finally, over the six-hour study, analysis of the total area under the curve (AUC) demonstrated that Lexaria’s TurboCBD resulted in a notable trend for higher levels of CBD in the bloodstream overall than the positive control formulation with total AUC of 10,865 ± 6,322 observed with Lexaria’s formulation compared to 7,115 ± 2,978 observed with the positive control (95% CI; p=0.096). Furthermore, when normalized to body mass, the AUC at the peak CBD concentration was markedly and significantly (95% CI; p=0.02) higher with the TurboCBD 90 mg dose compared to the 90 mg dose positive control formulation.

On March 20, 2019, the Company announced an in vivo research program to test Lexaria designed nanotech enhancements comprised of eleven separate animal studies. Lexaria also announced that, effective March 15, 2019, it terminated the definitive license agreement entered into between Lexaria CanPharm ULC and NeutriSci International Inc. that was originally announced on February 26, 2018.

On April 24, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Canpharm ULC, to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to a private California-based company for its utilization in certain CBD-based beverages to be produced and sold in California and Nevada that may include any combination of ready-to-drink beverages such as non-alcoholic beers, wines and spirits; cold or hot coffee or teas, sports drinks and more.

On May 7, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Hemp Corp., to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to a private Nevada-based company for its utilization in certain CBD-based beverages to be produced and sold across the USA that may include any combination of ready-to-drink beverages such as non-alcoholic beers, wines and spirits; cold or hot coffee or teas, sports drinks and more.

On May 15, 2019, the Company released initial results from its research program announced March 2019 demonstrating measurable quantities of cannabidiol into blood in as little as 2 minutes. In each arm of the Lexaria animal studies, 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered CBD at 25mg per kg of bodyweight. Delivery of CBD into the bloodstream was monitored over a 60-minute duration. In the first animal study results, Lexaria compared its standard DehydraTECH formulation that combines cannabinoids with long-chain fatty acids (“LCFA”) using Lexaria’s patented dehydration processing technique to a concentration-matched formulation utilizing coconut oil which is a commonly used medium chain triglyceride (“MCT”) oil in the cannabis edibles industry.


· | At 2 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation delivered measurable CBD in blood, compared to no measurable CBD in blood until 6 minutes and onwards for the MCT oil formulation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | At 15 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation achieved a CBD blood concentration level that was 475% more than the MCT oil formulation; and, the DehydraTECH LCFA formulation CBD blood levels reached at 15 minutes were greater than the CBD blood levels reached by the MCT oil formulation at any time point during the 60-minute evaluation.
· | At 60 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation achieved a CBD blood concentration level of 319% more than the MCT oil formulation. 
· | Over the entire 60-minute study, the animals that received the standard DehydraTECH LCFA formulation achieved an average maximum CBD blood concentration level that was 334% more than the average maximum blood concentration level of the animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p<0.0021). 
· | Over the entire 60-minute study, the area under the curve (AUC) (total quantity of CBD delivered) for the Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation was 389% more than the MCT oil formulation (p<0.0011). 


Lexaria also tested for brain tissue concentrations to quantify 8-hour CBD delivery from the DehydraTECH-enabled LCFA formulation compared to the MCT oil formulation and DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation outperformed the MCT oil formulation by 246%. 

On May 21, 2019, the Company announced a major expansion in operations by Nuka Enterprises LLC, (“Nuka”) maker of “1906” brand edibles over the next two years into Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan and other states. The comprehensive semi-exclusive agreement provides Nuka and 1906 with competitive technological advantages until 2028. A second license provides Nuka and 1906 with the immediate ability to utilize DehydraTECH technology for CBD across the US marketplace.

On May 28, 2019, the Company released additional results from its research program wherein animal testing proved that combining Lexaria’s DehydraTECH delivery technology with generic nanotech techniques delivers 1,137% more cannabidiol into animal brain tissue following oral ingestion than certain existing industry formulations. Lexaria combined its DehydraTECH delivery technology with a standard form of nanotechnology and analyzed subsequent delivery into brain tissue following oral ingestion. In each arm of the Lexaria animal studies, 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered CBD at the rate of 25mg per kg of bodyweight. Delivery of CBD into the brain was reported 8 hours after dosing.


· | The Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation without nanotech achieved an average brain tissue accumulation level that was 246% higher than the average for those animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p=0.0013).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation with nanotech achieved an average brain tissue accumulation level that was 1,137% higher than the average for those animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p=0.0178). 


On June 4, 2019 the Company announced additional results from the March 20, 2019 announced animal studies demonstrating improved performance characteristics resulting in new patent applications. This arm of the study tested DehydraTECH delivery technology with compounds postulated to behave in a synergistic fashion for enhancement of gastro-intestinal absorption separate and distinct from nanotech techniques.

On July 10, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Hemp Corp, to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to Nic’s Beverages Ltd for use in CBD-based beverages to be produced and sold throughout the United States.

On July 11, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Hemp Corp., to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to Universal Hemp LLC, a B2B manufacturing company of hemp-derived bulk ingredients to the nutraceutical and consumer packaged goods industries to be produced and sold across the USA immediately, and in Canada when regulations permit. Agreed to minimum payments over the life of the 5-year agreement are $3,750,000.

On July 24, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a 10-year Joint Manufacturing Partnership (JMP) with Hill Street Beverages Company Inc. to produce commercial products including processed THC cannabis and/or CBD hemp powder including among other categories; tablets, capsules, or packets for sale in Canada and for export where permitted. The JMP will also produce similar powders as a bulk ingredient for manufacturing processes for sale to other licensed producers seeking to use DehydraTECH to create their own products for sale within Canada. Profits from this business unit will be shared equally between Hill Street and Lexaria. In addition to the JMP, Hill Street acquired two global semi-exclusive licenses (with minor exceptions) to utilize Lexaria’s DehydraTECH THC beverage infusion technology around the world, valid for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreements, Hill Street will pay an annual licensing fee and up to an additional $1,800,000 to Lexaria by issuing $800,000 in common shares of Hill Street to Lexaria initially, and Lexaria will issue $250,000 in restricted common shares to Hill Street. In addition, Hill Street will issue up to an additional $500,000 in shares of Hill Street when they enter each of the first two international markets subject to TSXV and CSE approval, as applicable. Pursuant to the terms of the JMP agreements, Lexaria will issue an aggregate $250,000 in restricted common shares to Hill Street. Closing of the Hill Street / Lexaria agreements is subject to normal regulatory approvals and the closing of the Hill Street / OneLeaf transaction announced by Hill Street. Subsequent to August 31, 2019, Hill Street has been unable to close its transaction with OneLeaf and is currently searching for an alternate location from which to base the Hill Street / Lexaria agreements, thus there is a possibility that this transaction may not close as expected. 

On August 8, 2019, the Company announced the successful completion of its Master Collaborative Research Agreement (“the R&D Program”) with the National Research Council of Canada to investigate technical aspects and new opportunities associated with bioavailability enhancement of lipophilic active ingredient compositions using Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology. The R&D Program determined that Lexaria’s DehydraTECH does not create a covalent-bonded new molecular entity. The R&D program also tested Lexaria’s formulations at highly acidic levels of pH 1.12, higher than many flavored beverages that have pH levels between 2.73 to 3.05, and mildly acidic levels of pH 4.82, and reports no chemical modification or presence of degradation of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for both of the formulation classes analysed in this aspect of the program: cannabinoids and nicotine polacrilex.

On August 8, 2019, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Lexaria CanPharm ULC., has been issued cannabis Research and Development (“R&D”) license LIC-7NONT76UNW-2019 by Health Canada with a four-year term until August 9, 2023 unless renewed.

On August 14, 2019, the Company announced four patent grants. Australia Patent #2016367036 Grant Date July 30, 2019 – Methods for formulating orally ingestible compositions comprising lipophilic active agents, Australia Patent #2018220067 Grant Date July 30, 2019 – Food and beverage compositions infused with lipophilic active agents and methods of use thereof, US Patent #10,374,036 Grant Date August 6, 2019 - Food and beverage compositions infused with lipophilic active agents and methods of use thereof, and US Patent #10,381,440 / Grant Date August 13, 2019 - Food and beverage compositions infused with lipophilic active agents and methods of use thereof.

On August 22, 2019, the Company announced the online commercial launch of ChrgD+, a water-soluble multi-spectrum hemp oil in a powdered format with our DehydraTECH technology. 

On August 22, 2019, the Company announced a patent granted in Australia: #2016367037 Grant Date August 15, 2019 – “Stable ready-to-drink beverage compositions comprising lipophilic active agents”.

The Company experienced the following significant corporate developments subsequent to August 31, 2019

On September 17, 2019, the Company announced that final study results of the 2018 human clinical study evaluating CBD delivery and effectiveness using its patented DehydraTECH powered TurboCBD capsules have been published in the peer reviewed medical journal, “Advances in Therapy”. Advances in Therapy focuses on clinical medicine and pharmaceutical research and has been published continually since 1984.

The study was conducted and well tolerated in 12 healthy young male athletes and the investigators concluded that further studies are warranted.

Food Science and Technology

Lexaria is a biotechnology and food science company focused on developing and out-licensing its proprietary technology for improved taste, rapidity, and delivery of bioactive compounds in foods and other ingestible products Lexaria is focusing its capital and management time on its pursuit of intellectual property, technology licensing opportunities, an expanding portfolio of patent pending applications, and functional food and supplement formulations.

On November 11, 2014, the Company acquired 51% of PoViva Tea LLC (100% October 23, 2017) and executed an operating agreement to develop a business of legally producing, manufacturing, importing/exporting, testing, researching and developing, a line of hemp oil with cannabidiol-infused teas, drinks and foods. Lexaria oversees all aspects of the business including, but not limited to, production, product quality, licensing, testing, product legality, accounting, marketing, capital investment, capital raising, sales, branding, advertising and fulfillment. 

The Company introduced an expanding variety of hemp fortified consumer food products throughout 2015 to demonstrate Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology to both consumers and potential licensees. From January 2015 to December 2015, seven (7) flavors of teas; hot chocolate; coffee, and two (2) flavors of protein energy bars were introduced – all utilizing Lexaria’s patented technology DehydraTECH for the more palatable and efficient delivery of bioactive molecules infused within those food products.

In the production of the products, for each raw material to be used in ViPova branded products, the Company assesses if the product inputs and the completed products comply with all applicable food and drug laws, and that the inputs and the finished products meet all applicable legal and quality standards including and as it relates to hemp oil content; THC content; molds and mildews; heavy metals; and may measure additional components. 

The US Federal government, through the US Department of Health and Human Services, owns US Patent #6630507, which among other things, claims that

“Cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and HIV dementia.”

For reference, cannabinoids are compounds that affect cannabinoid receptors located on many human cells. CB1 receptors are widely found within the human brain; and CB2 receptors are found with the human immune system and have been linked to anti-inflammatory and other responses.

Despite independent scientific findings in many locations around the world, some regulatory agencies do not officially recognize that a human endocannabinoid system exists.

Over one hundred different cannabinoids have been isolated from the cannabis plant, most of which do not have psychoactive properties. One that does have psychoactive properties is THC. Endocannabinoids are produced naturally in the human body while Phyto cannabinoids are produced in several plant species, most abundantly in the Cannabis plant.

CBD is one of the major Phyto cannabinoid forms of cannabinoids and is not psychoactive, often contributing more than 35% of the extracts from the cannabis plant resin. CBD occurs naturally in other plant species beyond cannabis. For example, the most widely acknowledged alternative source of Phyto cannabinoid is in the better understood Echinacea species, in widespread use as a dietary supplement. Most Phyto cannabinoids are virtually insoluble in water but are soluble in lipids and alcohol. The World Anti Doping Agency (“WADA”) has exempted CBD from its 2018 list of banned substances.

The Alternative Health sector is large and growing. A long-term Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was conducted from 2002 until 2008 with at least 29,370 subjects asked repeatedly if they had seen any kind of health care practitioner in the previous six months. The survey recorded whether the health care provider was a “complementary and alternative medicine care professional,” including “homeopathic, naturopathic, or herbalist.” 


Page 9 of 83


Between 5.3% and 5.8% of the survey group at any one time reported that they had seen a complementary or alternative medicine provider. Based on the US population of ~328,000,000, this suggests between 17.4 million and 19.0 million Americans are seeking an alternative health care professional at any given time.

Meanwhile the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an April 2011 NCHS Data Brief, reported that more than 50% of the population uses dietary supplements of one kind or another. Detailed findings from that report included:


· | Use of dietary supplements is common among the U.S. adult population. Over 40% used supplements in 1988–1994, and over one-half in 2003–2006. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Multivitamins/multiminerals are the most commonly used dietary supplements, with approximately 40% of men and women reporting use during 2003–2006.
· | Use of supplemental calcium increased from 28% during 1988–1994 to 61% during 2003–2006 among women aged 60 and over. 


Status of Operations; Consumer product development and sales

More than 150 million Americans drink tea every day, amounting to some 79 billion servings of tea in America every year. Our launch of ViPova black tea brand is meant to tap into this existing demand. Part of our corporate strategy is to build national brands through products that large groups of potential customers are already familiar and comfortable with. 

PoViva Tea, LLC (now Poviva Corp.). has filed multiple patents pending and has received several granted patents to bind active hemp oil ingredients with a lipid, potentially allowing for more efficient and comforting delivery of CBD.

Lexaria began producing cash flows from its products in January 2015 focusing on the immediate opportunities in the hemp-oil-sectors that are federally legal. Cannabinoids have been found by many researchers to have antioxidant properties and Lexaria plans to use the patented DehydraTECH process to infuse hemp oils into a number of popular food and beverages. 

Lexaria has launched a line of premium products, always relying on its DehydraTECH patented infusion process, to bring hemp oil into the mainstream. Because hemp oil does not have psychoactive properties we expect our products to appeal to the widest possible customer base. To date we have focused our sales efforts across the continental USA. Some studies have found that 3% of the Canadian population regularly consumes hemp food products, while 1% of the American population regularly consumes hemp food products. We believe the consumption of hemp-based food products offers exceptional growth possibilities.

According to Nutrition Business Journal, the Organic Food sector was a $246 billion industry in the USA during 2014, while Dietary Supplements was a $34.6 billion industry. According to Arcview, Legal Cannabis was a $4.7 billion US industry in 2015 and expected to grow to over a $20 billion sector before 2025 but is clearly a much smaller industry sector than the more established food sectors. Lexaria has not yet determined whether our hemp oil-infused products will be accepted into any or all three of these particular sectors.

Lexaria has a main corporate website (www.lexariabioscience.com) as well as smaller e-commerce focused websites devoted to consumer products. The majority of product sales have taken place through the e-commerce websites. A contracted national distribution center ensures rapid and accurate fulfillment of all orders. A 1-800 ordering center has also been placed into operation. Through its subsidiaries, Lexaria currently sells small quantities of 3 flavors of tea, a capsule, and a powdered drink additive, all infused with Lexaria’s technology to deliver multi spectrum hemp oil ingredients.

On June 11, 2015, Lexaria initiated the simultaneous filing of a U.S. utility patent application and an International patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) procedure, both through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). These applications follow the Company’s 2014 and 2015 family of provisional patent application filings in the U.S. and serve two additional broad purposes:


1. | Lexaria is seeking protection of its intellectual property under international treaties. To this end Lexaria has filed for PCT patent application protection. There are 148 countries that are signatories to the Patent Cooperation Treaty, including such major markets as Canada, China, India, much of Europe and the Middle East, the United Kingdom and Japan among others.

2. | Lexaria believes its lipid infusion technology has applications beyond the delivery of just cannabinoids. Based on further formulation testing, Lexaria has included additional lipophilic molecules that may be delivered via food and beverage formats utilizing its technology, widely encompassing three major new market opportunities for the Company: Nicotine; Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatories (NSAIDs); and Vitamins.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In December 2015, the Company filed two further provisional patent applications in the U.S. These new applications served to further broaden the variety and applicability of base compounds that can be used when formulating the Company’s lipid-based technology. The first of these applications identify compounds like edible starches (e.g., tapioca starch) that are commonly used in food products today and could, therefore, serve as a base for formulating and incorporating the Company’s Technology into a wide variety of every day food products. The second of these applications identify emulsifier compounds like gum arabic that are commonly used in beverage products today in order to facilitate similar flexibility for formulating the Company’s technology in every day, shelf-stable beverages.

On October 26, 2016, the USPTO issued U.S Patent No. 9474725, Cannabinoid Infused Food and Beverage Compositions and Methods of Use Thereof, pertaining to our method of improving bioavailability and taste of certain cannabinoid lipophilic active agents in food products. This was the Company’s first patent granted and has a publish date of October 27, 2016 (June 15 2017 in Australia No. 2015274698) and protects our technology for twenty years. Additional patent grants include, but are not limited to: the use of DehydraTECH technology as a delivery platform, “composition of matter” claims that protect the specific combination of substances which enable improved taste and bio absorption properties, that protect processes for making specific compositions of matter for enhanced cannabinoid delivery utilizing the DehydraTECH technology. Of note, Lexaria has received issuance of patents in its second and third patent families representing the first time the Company has been granted claims for use of its technology in connection with the treatment of specific diseases and medical conditions affecting humans, which the Company believes will prove to be of significance to the pharmaceutical industry sector as it further develops and grows. Our portfolio consists of the following granted patents:

The Company does not know and cannot know whether these strategies will be successful, or if successful, how long it will take to gain consumer acceptance and customer loyalty. It can be a challenge to be successful by introducing new consumer products to a competitive retail marketplace, and we can offer no assurances that our products will be a commercial success.

International Patent Protection

When Lexaria first began examining the legal medical cannabis market in 2013, and entered the market in 2014, the Company believed it could make an impact in perhaps both the Canadian and U.S. marketplaces. Our pursuit and development of technology has expanded our potential area of impact, both geographically and by sector. Because of the applicability of our technology to markets outside of the legal cannabis sector, we have taken the necessary steps to protect that intellectual property within larger global markets in other unrelated sectors such as nicotine, vitamins, and pharmaceuticals.
Additional Molecules

NICOTINE. More than 99% of all nicotine that is consumed worldwide is delivered through smoking cigarettes. Approximately 6,000,000 deaths per year, worldwide, are attributed primarily to the delivery of nicotine through the act of smoking according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also estimates that over $170 billion per year is spent just in the USA on direct medical care costs for adult smokers. 69% of U.S. adult smokers want to quit smoking and 43% of US adult smokers have attempted to quit in any twelve-month period.

Worldwide, retail cigarette sales were worth $722 billion in 2013, with over 5.7 trillion cigarettes sold to more than 1 billion smokers. 

NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES. NSAIDs are the second-largest category of pain management treatment options in the world. The global pain management market was estimated at $22 billion in 2011, with $5.4 billion of this market being served by NSAIDs. The U.S. makes up over one-half of the global market. The opioids market (such as morphine) form the largest single pain management sector but are known to be associated with serious dependence and tolerance issues.

Some of the most commonly known NSAIDs are ASA (Aspirin), Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and Acetaminophen (Tylenol - Acetaminophen is not accepted by all persons to be an NSAID). Although NSAIDs are generally a safe and effective treatment method for pain, they have been associated with a number of gastrointestinal problems including dyspepsia and gastric bleeding.

VITAMINS. The global vitamin and supplement market is worth $68 billion according to Euromonitor. The category is both broad and deep, comprised of many popular and some lesser known substances. Vitamins in general are thought to be an $8.5 billion annual market in the U.S. The U.S. is the largest single national market in the world, and China and Japan are the 2nd and 3rd largest vitamin markets.

Vitamin E is fat soluble and can be incorporated into cell membranes which can protect them from oxidative damage. Global consumption of natural source vitamin E was 10,900 metric tons in 2013 worth $611.9 million. 

On August 11, 2015, Lexaria signed a license agreement with PoViva Tea LLC for $10,000, granting Lexaria a 35-year non-exclusive worldwide license to unencumbered use of PoViva Tea LLC’s IP Rights, including rights of resale. This license agreement ensures Lexaria has full access to the underlying infusion technology. On January 14, 2019 this agreement was updated whereby Poviva Corp. granted Lexaria an exclusive license to the DehydraTECH technologies lasting the later of 25 years of the expiration date of the last of Poviva Corp.’s granted patents. 

Scientific testing and validation 

On August 24, 2015, the Company announced potential industry-changing achievements in enhanced gastro-intestinal absorption of CBD utilizing Lexaria’s technology. The third-party testing was conducted in two phases of in vitro tests beginning in June and completed in August 2015.

The independent laboratory results delivered average CBD permeability of 499% of baseline permeability, compared to CBD permeability without Lexaria’s Technology. These results exceed Company expectations. This was assessed in a strictly controlled, in vitro experiment using a human intestinal tissue model. Samples of Lexaria’s commercially available CBD-fortified ViPova black tea were administered in the model compared with concentration-matched CBD control preparations that lacked Lexaria’s patented formulation and process enhancements. Lexaria believes that its in vitro findings provide compelling evidence of the intestinal absorption enhancing capabilities of its technology, based on which it is exploring opportunities to progress to more advanced, follow-on bioavailability testing in animals. 


Page 12 of 83


The tests also showed 325% of baseline gastro-intestinal permeability of CBD comparing Lexaria’s CBD-fortified ViPova black tea to a second control of CBD and black tea combined, without Lexaria’s patented formulation enhancements. This confirmed that the specialized processing undertaken by Lexaria during its manufacturing process together with its formulation enhancements, does indeed significantly improve absorption levels.

The bioavailability of CBD (or of THC) varies greatly by delivery method. Smoking typically delivers cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of 30% (Huestis (2007) Chem. Biodiverse. 4:1770–1804; McGilveray (2005) Pain Res. Manag. 10 Suppl. A:15A – 22A). By comparison, orally consumed cannabis edibles typically deliver cannabinoids at an average bioavailability rate of only 5% (Karschner et al. (2011) Clin. Chem. 57:66–75). 

The Company’s present findings suggest that its technology may achieve a 5-fold improvement in cannabinoid absorption in edible form over that which can be achieved without its proprietary process and formulation enhancements. This conceptually supports that Lexaria’s technology represents a significant breakthrough in cannabinoid delivery by approximating the high absorption levels achieved as though through administration by smoking, but without the associated negative effects on human health caused by smoking.

The tests were completed in two phases culminating with testing using simulated intestinal fluid conditions that delivered these findings. These results were stronger than earlier iterations of the tests that did not use a simulated intestinal fluid environment and contributed to Lexaria’s understanding of the mechanisms at work. For these and other reasons, Lexaria believes that bioavailability testing in animals is likely to yield even stronger absorption results in the presence of natural intestinal fluid conditions.

CBD has been repeatedly found to provide beneficial pain relieving, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, neuroprotection, anti-psychotic, and anti-convulsive effects among others. Lexaria’s patented technology could significantly reduce individual serving requirements for CBD to consumers. This could lead to reduced costs of consumption for consumers and increased profitability for Lexaria.

Lexaria believes that the same technology used to enhance the absorption of CBD in the recent laboratory tests, is applicable to THC, nicotine, NSAIDs and other lipophilic compounds that are widely used today.

During January 2015, Lexaria conducted a study of nitric oxide levels in humans, as a biomarker for absorption of CBD, with the expectation that it would provide additional evidence of the efficient absorption of CBD from Lexaria food products enhanced with hemp oil, by demonstrating the elevation of nitric oxide in the human body in response to product ingestion.

The study data from human subjects demonstrated significant elevation of systemic nitric oxide levels as a surrogate biomarker for CBD bio absorption in response to ingestion of Lexaria’s products. This provided clinical support for the CBD bioavailability enhancing properties of Lexaria’s patented Technology, on the premise that bioavailable CBD is known to elevate levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the human body which, in turn, stimulates release of nitric oxide in the vascular system. 

In summary, consuming Lexaria’s food products resulted in elevated levels of nitric oxide within the body. The results of the study indicated that all of Lexaria food products elicited significant increases in salivary nitric oxide, achieving levels from 110 µM to as high as 220 µM in the test subjects. The ViPova beverage products generally had faster initial responses in as little as 15 minutes after product ingestion, whereas the initial responses from the Lexaria Energy protein-energy bars required 30 minutes. The faster response time with the beverage products was to be expected, given the relative ease of digesting liquids versus solids. All products sustained their maximum levels of nitric oxide detection through to the 60-minute end-points used in the study, indicating a need for additional study to determine the length of time that nitric oxide levels remain elevated following production consumption.

The study assessed six flavors of ViPova tea (Yunan Black, Herbal Cherry Black, Earl Grey, Herbal Bengal Chai, Herbal Masala Chai and Decaf English Breakfast), ViPova Columbian Supremo Coffee, ViPova Hot Chocolate and Lexaria Energy Foods’ Chocolate Berry Date and Cashew Berry Date protein-energy bars.

Six healthy human subjects (3 male and 3 female) between the ages of 22 and 65 years of age were recruited for the study. Subjects were screened for cardiovascular and allergic response to hemp products, were non-smokers and did not have any history of substance or alcohol abuse. One product was studied per day across all six subjects, with each subject consuming a full product serving size. Subjects were required to refrain from eating food or using vape products for at least 12 hours before test article administration on each day of the study. Nitric oxide levels in the test subjects were assessed using a commercially available, colorimetric test kit designed to quantify systemic nitric oxide via a detectable salivary marker. Immediately before test article administration each day, all subjects were required to demonstrate a negative baseline nitric oxide saliva test. Subjects were considered to have a negative test strip reading at a level of 20 µM according to the test strip scale, and positive readings anywhere above this. Subjects performed salivary nitric oxide testing at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes’ post-consumption of each product. All subjects remained sedentary from baseline through to the completion of testing for each product.

In August of 2018 we released results from our TurboCBD capsules in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind European human clinical study that evaluated TurboCBD - a proprietary, DehydraTECH powered, CBD fortified hemp oil capsule developed by Lexaria. The degree and speed of CBD absorption into blood plasma and potential cardiovascular and cognitive performance enhancement in 12 healthy male volunteers were studied.

Key bioavailability data highlights from the study comparing the 90 mg dose of Lexaria’s TurboCBD to a 90 mg dose of a positive control formulation without Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology were as follows:


· | 30 Minutes: CBD delivered from Lexaria’s TurboCBD capsules was absorbed much more effectively than from the positive control, delivering 317% more CBD to blood at the 30-minute mark of the study (i.e., 18.4 ng/mL compared to only 4.4 ng/mL on average respectively [95% CI; p=0.051]); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | 60 Minutes: The TurboCBD capsules went on to deliver more CBD to the blood at the 60-minute mark (i.e., 38.8 ng/mL) than the positive control capsules were able to reach at any time during the 6-hour study, further demonstrating the exceptional rapidity of action and effectiveness of the TurboCBD capsules;
· | 90 Minutes: The TurboCBD capsules further went on to deliver significantly more CBD to the blood (86% more) than the positive control capsules at the 90-minute mark (i.e., 53.0 ng/mL compared to only 28.4 ng/mL respectively [95% CI; p=0.034]); 
· | Through to Study Completion: Lexaria’s TurboCBD capsules continued to deliver more CBD to blood than the positive control capsules at each subsequent time point in the study through to the 6-hour mark when the study was completed. 


Additional study analysis was released in February 2019:

Key metabolic and hemodynamic performance findings linked to bioavailability enhancements were revealed in the study, which compared a 90 mg dose of Lexaria’s TurboCBD to a 90 mg dose without Lexaria’s DehydraTECH™ technology (the “positive control”) as well as a placebo, as follows:


· | Analysis of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at peak blood levels of CBD achieved with Lexaria’s TurboCBD demonstrated a significant reduction in MAP compared to placebo (95% CI; p=0.027). This finding was not observed with the dose-matched positive control formulation for which there was no significant decrease in MAP compared to placebo (95% CI; p=0.625);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Cerebral perfusion was also analysed by an index of conductance in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The findings revealed that Lexaria’s TurboCBD caused the greatest increase in MCA conductance relative to both the positive control formulation and placebo (95% CI; p=0.017 and P=0.002 respectively); 


Finally, over the six-hour study, analysis of the total area under the curve (AUC) demonstrated that Lexaria’s TurboCBD resulted in a notable trend for higher levels of CBD in the bloodstream overall than the positive control formulation with total AUC of 10,865 ± 6,322 observed with Lexaria’s formulation compared to 7,115 ± 2,978 observed with the positive control (95% CI; p=0.096). Furthermore, when normalized to body mass, the AUC at the peak CBD concentration was markedly and significantly (95% CI; p=0.02) higher with the TurboCBD 90 mg dose compared to the 90 mg dose positive control formulation.

These results corroborate and confirm other in vitro and in vivo studies that have evaluated Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology. Although this study evaluated absorption only of CBD and its metabolites, Lexaria believes nearly identical bioavailability enhancement results would be achieved with other cannabinoids.

During March of 2019 we also launched an in vivo research program to test Lexaria designed nanotech enhancements comprised of eleven separate animal studies and released initial results during May 2019 demonstrating measurable quantities of cannabidiol into blood in as little as 2 minutes. In each arm of the animal studies, 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered CBD at 25mg per kg of bodyweight. Delivery of CBD into the bloodstream was monitored over a 60-minute duration. In the first animal study results, Lexaria compared its standard DehydraTECH formulation that combines cannabinoids with long-chain fatty acids (“LCFA”) using Lexaria’s patented dehydration processing technique to a concentration-matched formulation utilizing coconut oil which is a commonly used MCT oil in the cannabis edibles industry.


· | At 2 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation delivered measurable CBD in blood, compared to no measurable CBD in blood until 6 minutes and onwards for the MCT oil formulation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | At 15 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation achieved a CBD blood concentration level that was 475% more than the MCT oil formulation; and, the DehydraTECH LCFA formulation CBD blood levels reached at 15 minutes were greater than the CBD blood levels reached by the MCT oil formulation at any time point during the 60-minute evaluation.


Page 14 of 83


· | At 60 minutes DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation achieved a CBD blood concentration level of 319% more than the MCT oil formulation. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Over the entire 60-minute study, the animals that received the standard DehydraTECH LCFA formulation achieved an average maximum CBD blood concentration level that was 334% more than the average maximum blood concentration level of the animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p<0.0021).
· | Over the entire 60-minute study, the area under the curve (AUC) (total quantity of CBD delivered) for the Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation was 389% more than the MCT oil formulation (p<0.0011). 


Lexaria also tested for brain tissue concentrations to quantify 8-hour CBD delivery from the DehydraTECH-enabled LCFA formulation compared to the MCT oil formulation and DehydraTECH’s LCFA formulation outperformed the MCT oil formulation by 246%. 

The Company released additional results from its March 2019 research program wherein animal testing proved that combining Lexaria’s DehydraTECH delivery technology with generic nanotech techniques delivers 1,137% more CBD into animal brain tissue following oral ingestion than certain existing industry formulations. Lexaria combined its DehydraTECH delivery technology with a standard form of nanotechnology and analyzed subsequent delivery into brain tissue following oral ingestion. Delivery of CBD into the brain was reported 8 hours after dosing.


· | The Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation without nanotech achieved an average brain tissue accumulation level that was 246% higher than the average for those animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p=0.0013).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Lexaria DehydraTECH LCFA formulation with nanotech achieved an average brain tissue accumulation level that was 1,137% higher than the average for those animals that received the MCT oil formulation (p=0.0178). 


Further results demonstrated that Enhanced DehydraTECH led to 811% more CBD delivery into blood than generic industry MCT coconut-oil formulations (p=0.00008); and 110% more CBD into blood than DehydraTECH in its traditional format (p=0.02). 


Page 15 of 83


· | Enhanced DehydraTECH delivered roughly twice as much CBD to animal blood at all measured time points in the study from the 15-minute mark onwards, compared to traditional DehydraTECH; and during the same time points from 717% to 1098% more CBD than the generic industry MCT coconut oil formulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Enhanced DehydraTECH delivered more CBD to blood in just 12 minutes than the MCT coconut-oil formulation was able to achieve at any point during the 1-hour test duration. 
· | Enhanced DehydraTECH is even faster acting, reaching a maximum blood concentration level (“tmax”) in just 45 minutes compared to traditional DehydraTECH at 50 minutes and the MCT coconut oil formulation at 57 minutes. 
· | Enhanced DehydraTECH delivered an astonishing 1,937% more CBD into animal brain tissue after 8 hours compared to generic industry MCT coconut oil formulations; and 487% more than traditional DehydraTECH. 


Both traditional DehydraTECH and Enhanced DehydraTECH delivered maximum blood concentration levels prior to the 60-minute end-of-test, with levels tapering off thereafter. The DehydraTECH technology therefore demonstrates both fast onset and fast offset as tested which is of interest for dose titration purposes when repeated dosing is desired.

We have also completed our first study evaluating DehydraTECH used in a topical cream formulation for absorption of CBD through human skin. Results proved significant increases in both speed and quantity of CBD absorption through skin when compared to control formulations. The absorption study was performed on human skin at a California-based laboratory that specializes in Franz diffusion cell skin permeability testing. Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology was used together with a sophisticated oil-in-water emulsion formulation design and compared to a series of matching oil-in-water emulsion formulations prepared with the same CBD inputs, with and without the DehydraTECH technology and with and without two leading skin penetration enhancers currently used in the skin products industry. Several factors were measured, including the time required to detect CBD skin penetration and quantity, and peak amounts of CBD absorbed into and through the skin, at multiple testing intervals over a 48-hour duration.


Page 16 of 83


Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-enabled topical formulation, absent either of the commercial penetration enhancers, was the fastest acting for absorption into the epidermis, dermis or through the skin into the systemic fraction representing permeation into the underlying circulatory system. Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-enabled product also had no odour even without the use of perfumes, contrary to other cannabinoid industry products that can be quite strongly odoriferous without the use of masking perfumes.

Furthermore, Lexaria’s DehydraTECH-enabled topical formulation without the addition of either of the commercial penetration enhancers, demonstrated the highest overall average quantity of CBD delivered through the skin and into the representative systemic fraction of all the formulations tested, with as much as a 225% increase in CBD permeability when compared to the highest performing commercial penetration enhancer formulation assessed and almost a 1,900% increase in CBD permeability when compared to a control formulation that was devoid of both the DehydraTECH technology or any commercial penetration enhancers. The commercial skin penetration enhancers only demonstrated performance that was on par or superior to the DehydraTECH-enabled formulations tested in so far as total CBD absorption into the shallow epidermis or dermis was concerned.

We have also completed our first ingestible nicotine in vivo (animal) absorption study. Lexaria is pursuing the use of its patented DehydraTECH technology as a possible new nicotine delivery method, an edible dose absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract, with potential both as a nicotine replacement therapy as well as an alternative product format for regular tobacco users. 

DehydraTECH delivered the following major nicotine absorption performance improvements: 1,160% faster delivery of equivalent peak quantities of nicotine to the bloodstream than achieved with controls (within 15 min vs. 2.9 hours), 148% gain in the quantity of peak nicotine delivery to the bloodstream relative to controls, 560% higher brain levels of nicotine where nicotine effects are focused, compared to controls, Lower urine levels of nicotine excreted than controls, for enhanced nicotine activity and bioavailability over the course of the study, lower quantities of key liver metabolites in the bloodstream than controls as hypothesized, suggesting bypass of first pass liver metabolism.

Study Design Parameters:

The study was designed to principally assess the relative ingestible nicotine absorption performance of DehydraTECH-powered formulations compared to concentration-matched control formulations that lacked any form of delivery enabling technology in rats. Nicotine was administered in a nicotine polacrilex derivative format as is widely commercialized today in nicotine replacement therapy products such as chewing gums. Twelve male rats were divided into four groups of three, such that DehydraTECH and control formulations were each tested at a 1 mg/Kg and 10 mg/Kg dosage level. Formulations were administered orally and all rats were cannulated for blood collection at multiple intervals over an 8 hour duration post-dosing with the first data collection at the 15-minute mark. Urine and feces were also collected for up to a 24-hour duration post-dosing, and essential organ tissue samples were also collected for examination after the study. All samples were subjected to analytical testing in order to quantify the levels of nicotine therein, as well as the levels of three major liver metabolites thereof, hydroxycotinine, nicotine N’-oxide and cotinine, in order to assess the relative metabolite levels absorbed by the different formulations. Lexaria’s hypothesis was tested to prove that its DehydraTECH technology would influence more rapid and complete intestinal bio absorption of nicotine lymphatically with less metabolic degradation by the liver. All animals were also assessed for general tolerability of the administered formulations. The study was conducted at the same independent laboratory in Philadelphia where the Company completed its initial CBD absorption study in 2015.
Results & Observations:

The Lexaria formulations generally achieved faster absorption, higher peak absorption and higher overall quantities of nicotine, on average, in the blood than the concentration-matched control formulations at both the 1mg and 10 mg/Kg doses tested. Furthermore, as previously reported, there were no obvious signs of gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting or diarrhea indicating that the animals appeared to tolerate the treatment well. 

Nicotine blood levels were evaluated multiple times over a period of 8 hours after dosing. In the 10mg/Kg dosing arm, the control formulation required nearly 3 hours to reach similar levels of blood absorption that the Lexaria formulation reached in only 15 minutes. Furthermore, the Lexaria formulation went on thereafter to demonstrate peak plasma levels that were 148% of those achieved by the control formulation. If replicated in human studies, these findings are suggestive that Lexaria’s technology could prove more effective in elevating blood nicotine levels through edible formats much more quickly and substantially than previously theorized, potentially making ingestible nicotine preparations a viable alternative to today’s available product formats while also leading to a more rapid nicotine craving satiation.


Page 17 of 83


Analysis of the liver metabolites revealed, as expected, that overall levels in the blood of two of the three metabolites studied were higher in the control group than in the Lexaria formulation group at the 10 mg/Kg dose. This result was especially pronounced in the 45-minute to 2-hour time interval post-dosing which is consistent with the expected timing of release of metabolites in higher quantity into the bloodstream by the liver following normal physiological processing of ingested nicotine with the control preparation, compared to the DehydraTECH technology that is believed to elude first pass liver metabolism. The Lexaria formulation also demonstrated lower quantities of nicotine in the rat urine at both doses, which is consistent with the fact that the levels of nicotine in the rat blood remained higher over the duration of the study with the Lexaria formulation than with the control. The study also revealed that the Lexaria formulation at the 10 mg/Kg level achieved up to 5.6-times as much nicotine upon analysis of the rat brain tissue than was recovered with the matching control formulation. These findings together perhaps suggest prolongation of nicotine effectiveness with the Lexaria formulation which may also be beneficial in humans to control cravings over an extended time-period from a single edible nicotine dose.

In our follow-up third-party in vivo statistically significant study, including two groups of 20 animals, further defining delivery of nicotine in edible form at each of the 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-minute intervals post-dosing, with 90.2% greater delivery than the concentration-matched control formulation by the 10-minute mark (95% CI; p=0.044), and significantly greater absorption levels than the control formulation at all subsequent time points in the study. Speed of onset is a key attribute for oral drug administration, and it is of particular importance for the consideration of non-inhalation nicotine delivery formats.

Key highlights of the follow-up study are as follows:


· | Peak Level: 79% improvement in peak blood levels (maximum concentration or “Cmax”) at 394 ng/mL using Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology vs. 220 ng/mL with the control (95% CI; p=0.0257); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Total Quantity: 94% improvement in total quantity of nicotine delivered (area under the curve or “AUC”) to the blood during the 60-minute course of the study, at 266 hr•ng/mL versus 137 hr•ng/mL (95% CI; p=0.0086); 
· | Rapidity: Lexaria’s technology delivered nicotine into the blood stream by the first time interval of blood sampling at the 2-minute mark. On average, Lexaria’s technology delivered 203 ng/mL to the blood in aggregate of the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15-minute time points, compared to only 120 ng/mL in aggregate over the same period by the control, an improvement of 70% (95% CI; p=0.0004).


In addition to the above described scientific testing and validation studies, Lexaria has also conducted various cannabinoid formulation experiments, together with potential DehydraTECH licensee partners, on chocolates, candies, gummies, mouth-melts, chocolate bars, protein bars, beverages such as beer, spices, tea, coffee, supplements and more over the past several years. Beverage formulations have produced cannabinoid water-based products including de-alcoholized beer that mask unwanted cannabis flavor and are fast acting. Chocolate formulations were reported as being the fastest acting, most consistent, and best-tasting products relative to comparator control formulations in approximately 70% of cases in a recent 2017 consumer study. As well, on March 22, 2016, Lexaria announced results from another chocolate formulation consumer study in which test subjects ranked those chocolates that had been created with Lexaria’s technology as the best tasting, most palatable and providing the best overall experience of the chocolates sampled. Furthermore, the test subjects in that study indicated a time of onset of the cannabis oil effects in as little as 15-20 minutes on average. The study included 12 volunteers who were all regular cannabis consumers with experience ingesting conventional edibles. All chocolates used in the study were blinded (unmarked) in order that the subjects could not discern the product formulations applied.

Technology out-licensing

On May 14, 2016, the Company entered into a Licensing Agreement with Nuka Enterprises, LLC (“Nuka”) for a two-year period, to utilize the Company’s technology to create, test, manufacture, and sell marijuana-infused consumable and/or topical products, in the state of Colorado, with an option of extending the terms of the Licensing Agreement to Washington, Oregon, and California. On April 30, 2018, the Company announced a new 10-year renewal licensing agreement with Nuka, maker of 1906 brand cannabis chocolates and other edible products. The new agreement provides Nuka with semi-exclusive ability to utilize the DehydraTECH technology across the US. Nuka also acquired an option to expand its products and brand to Canada, including using Lexaria’s existing chocolate and confections contract manufacturer licensee Cannfections Group Inc. The agreement incorporates new rights in product categories in addition to the original chocolate formats, which include candies, beverages, capsules and pills, and topical creams. On May 21, 2019, we announced a major expansion in operations by Nuka over the next two years into Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan and other states. The comprehensive semi-exclusive agreement provides Nuka and 1906 with competitive technological advantages until 2028. A second license provides Nuka and 1906 with the immediate ability to utilize DehydraTECH technology for CBD across the US marketplace.

GP acquired a 5-year semi-exclusive right. Subsequent to year end, on September 28, 2018, the Company cancelled the contract due to ongoing delays and non-performance.

On July 31, 2018, the Company and Hill Street Beverage Company Inc., (TSXV:BEER; “Hill Street”) jointly announced that they signed a Definitive Agreement to license Lexaria’s DehydraTECH, on a semi-exclusive basis, for a term of five (5) years, to produce a line of cannabis-infused alcohol-free beverages for Canadian distribution, following regulatory approval.

On January 15, 2019, the Company announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Lexaria Nicotine and Altria Ventures Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”), executed definitive agreements to pursue innovation in oral, reduced risk nicotine consumer products using Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology. Altria was granted a license to use Lexaria’s DehydraTECH technology for oral nicotine delivery forms on an exclusive basis in the United States and a non-exclusive basis elsewhere globally. Altria will pay Lexaria Nicotine a royalty on revenue generated from the sale of nicotine products containing DehydraTECH, until such time it may acquire 100% ownership in Lexaria Nicotine. There is no requirement that Altria must acquire 100% ownership in Lexaria Nicotine. 

On April 24, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Canpharm ULC, to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to a private California-based company for its utilization in certain CBD-based beverages to be produced and sold in California and Nevada that may include any combination of ready-to-drink beverages such as non-alcoholic beers, wines and spirits; cold or hot coffee or teas, sports drinks and more.

On May 7, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a definitive 5-year agreement, via its subsidiary Lexaria Hemp Corp., to provide Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology to a private Nevada-based company for its utilization in certain CBD-based beverages to be produced and sold across the USA that may include any combination of ready-to-drink beverages such as non-alcoholic beers, wines and spirits; cold or hot coffee or teas, sports drinks and more.

On July 24, 2019, the Company announced that it entered a 10-year Joint Manufacturing Partnership (JMP) with Hill Street to produce commercial products including processed THC cannabis and/or CBD hemp powder including among other categories; tablets, capsules, or packets for sale in Canada and for export where permitted. The JMP will also produce similar powders as a bulk ingredient for manufacturing processes for sale to other licensed producers seeking to use DehydraTECH to create their own products for sale within Canada. Profits from this business unit will be shared equally between Hill Street and Lexaria. In addition to the JMP, Hill Street acquired two global semi-exclusive licenses (with minor exceptions) to utilize Lexaria’s DehydraTECH THC beverage infusion technology around the world, valid for 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Hill Street will pay an annual licensing fee of $15,000 and up to $1,800,000 to Lexaria by issuing $800,000 in common shares of Hill Street to Lexaria initially with up to an additional $500,000 in shares of Hill Street when they enter each of the first two international markets subject to TSXV and CSE approval, as applicable. Pursuant to the terms of the JMP agreements, Lexaria will issue an aggregate $250,000 in restricted common shares to Hill Street. Closing of the Hill Street / Lexaria agreements is subject to normal regulatory approvals and the closing of the Hill Street / OneLeaf transaction announced by Hill Street. Subsequent to August 31, 2019, Hill Street has been unable to close its transaction with OneLeaf and is currently searching for an alternate location from which to base the Hill Street / Lexaria agreements, thus there is a possibility that this transaction may not close as expected.

The continuation of our business interests in these sectors is dependent upon obtaining further financing, a successful program of development, and, ultimately, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.

We are not yet profitable and have not yet demonstrated our ability to generate significant revenues from our business plan. We will require additional corporate funds if our existing capital is not sufficient to support the Company until potential future profitability is reached. There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our long-term operations. We expect to require additional operating capital during our fiscal 2020 year. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other longer-term obligations as they become due. In such event, we could be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations. There is uncertainty as to whether we can obtain additional long-term financing if we do in fact require it.

Our business plan anticipates that we will hire two to four additional staff during fiscal 2020 to enhance operations in our new office and licenced laboratory space. We expect to be able to utilize contracted third-parties for our production and distribution needs, instead focusing our capital on higher value-added aspects of the business such as research and development, and scientific testing. We have no current plans to build our own production facility.

Our company relies on the business experience of our existing management, on the technical abilities of consulting experts, and on the technical and operational abilities of its operating partner companies to evaluate business opportunities.

Competition

Competition in alternative health sectors and in consumer products in the USA is fierce. We expect to encounter competitive threats from existing participants in the sector and new entrants. Although PoViva Corp. has filed patent applications to protect intellectual property, there is no assurance that patents beyond those already issued will be granted nor that other firms may not file superior patents pending. Food supplements, organic foods, and health food markets are all well established and the Company will face many challenges trying to enter these markets. Lexaria is also aware of various competing technologies that exist in the marketplace that claim to also enhance the bio absorption of cannabinoids as Lexaria has demonstrated through repeated in vitro and in vivo scientific testing with its patented DehydraTECH technology. By and large, these technologies are mostly forms of nanotechnology that generally claim to enable the formation of microencapsulated microemulsions of cannabinoid active ingredients. These technologies can enable exceptional water solubility of cannabinoid ingredients and can impart improved intestinal bio absorption as a result. 

Page 20 of 83


Competition in nicotine, alternative nicotine delivery and nicotine cessation sectors in the USA is comprised of long-established entities, brands, and new technologies competing to create less harmful options. The sectors are complicated by the significant historical empirical data of older products or technologies versus the more limited published supporting data regarding the effects of new products or technologies. Due to the size of the sectors we expect to encounter competitive threats from existing participants and unknown new entrants. There is no assurance that other technologies already deployed, or in development, will not form the basis of product formats that competitors or consumers choose to utilize. It is also possible that historic delivery methods that have been in use and the familiarity with them may prevent adoption of products utilizing our technology in alternative delivery formats. Competing technologies or products may utilize known delivery formats or entirely new and unforecastable formats. Lexaria has demonstrated through scientific testing with its patented DehydraTECH technology that it delivers nicotine rapidly and effectively through oral delivery. We believe that if we can educate and influence consumers to adopt a food grade edible product format, and if US regulatory bodies authorize such formats, we may be able to offer a competitively successful new product format that utilizes our technology. 

The legal marijuana industry is comprised of several sub-sectors and is legal under different guidelines in many states though it remains illegal under most federal laws. Notwithstanding, the overall sector is generally recognized to be one of the fastest growing in the USA, with state-legal revenue of over $8 billion in 2016. Independent projections and publicized reports expect revenue of $20 billion or more in 2020, both as the sector gains in credibility and acceptance, and as more and more states legalize either medical use or adult recreational use; or both. In June of 2019 there were eleven states and one district that had legalized medical and recreational use, and more than twenty-two other states that had legalized medical use. In any fast-growing industry, competition is expected to be both strong and also difficult to evaluate as to the most effective competitive threats. While we are an early adopter within the cannabinoid delivery sector, there are already reports of more than 300 public companies that have claimed to be involved in the sector in some fashion; and an unknown number of private companies. Our current strategies may prove to be ineffective as the sector grows and matures, and if so, we will have to adapt quickly to changing sectoral circumstances. Accordingly, the Company intends to aggressively pursue technology out-licensing opportunities not only within the cannabinoids sector where it is already active, but also across other sectors where its DehydraTECH technology is patent allowed and/or pending, including the opportunities in the vitamin and supplements sector, the pain relief sector and the nicotine products sector.

However, it is Lexaria’s belief that its patented DehydraTECH technology offers a host of benefits beyond what competing technologies can offer, including superior oral palatability, a more appealing and all-natural ingredient compositional profile from a food and beverage formulation perspective, more predictable time of delivery into bloodstream, and superior scalability and cost effectiveness from a manufacturing perspective. Lexaria believes that its DehydraTECH technology is, therefore, significantly distinguished from competing technologies in these respects, with a view to growing the breadth and number of licensees that will adopt its technology for their product offerings going forward. Lexaria believes that these competitive advantages together with its wealth of scientific data showing noteworthy bio absorption enhancements with its DehydraTECH technology constitute a compelling value proposition for its prospective licensees, and it intends to continue to pursue license arrangements not only within the cannabinoids edibles sector where it is already active, but also in the various other bioactive ingredient sectors identified in its issued and pending patent applications.

Compliance with Government Regulation

Over 30 States in the USA have passed some form of legislation related to that state’s permission to grow, cultivate, sell or use marijuana either for medical purposes or for recreational or “adult use” purposes; or both. The various state legislation is not necessarily harmonious with one another. It is most often not legal to transport cannabis-related products across state lines.

Lexaria does not “touch the plant” or manufacture, process or sell cannabis in any location within the USA. Lexaria does conduct research and development on cannabis ingredients legally in Canada, in a federally licensed laboratory in compliance with all federal and local Canadian laws. We comply with US federal law that provides for certain exemptions for agricultural (industrial) hemp and certain by-products to be manufactured and sold in the US. The DehydraTECH technology may have applications within the legal marijuana sector and we may seek to license that technology to companies that have met and comply with state regulations for the sale or distribution of cannabis related products in any particular jurisdiction. 


Page 21 of 83


Lexaria’s position is that, just as a telephone company provides communications services, and an electric company provides electrical power, our provision of technological services to a state-legal cannabis company is in compliance with laws and required regulations.

Lexaria’s patented DehydraTECH technology also has applications in completely separate sectors such as vitamins, NSAIDs, and nicotine. We have no products nor operations in any of these sectors today, although we have commenced formulation development for research and validation purposes in each of these areas. We have a formal relationship with the largest cigarette company in the US and are conducting R&D with that company related to the possible development of nicotine oral products. If we enter any of these sectors at any time, we will be exposed to and of necessity will have to comply with, all local, state and federal regulations in each of those sectors. As a result of the possibility of Lexaria being involved in a number of disparate business sectors, compliance with government regulations could require significant resources and expertise from our company.

The US Federal Government passed the 2018 Farm Bill (the “Bill”), in December of 2018, that may have significant impacts on industry segments that we operate and have products in and potentially change some of the regulatory compliance risks that may affect our business. The Bill includes lifting restrictions on advertising, marketing, banking and other financial services as well as allowing interstate commerce for hemp and hemp-derived CBD, removing barriers for intellectual property protections under federal law such as patents and trademarks, as well as several other measures that may positively impact these industry segments overall. The impact the Bill may have on other regulatory bodies and their regulations will require ongoing monitoring to determine the outcome and timing of any revisions.

Enertopia Joint Venture

On May 28, 2014, our Company entered into a joint venture agreement with Enertopia Corp. for a prospective medical marijuana business under the Canadian Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (“MMPR”) for a 49% net ownership interest in the business (Enertopia 51%) utilizing an identified location in Burlington, Ontario (the “Burlington Joint Venture”). 

On June 26, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement with Enertopia Corp. and Shaxon Enterprises Ltd. to sell our 49% interest in the Burlington Joint Venture and the MMPR application number 10MMPR0610. Pursuant to the sale terms of the agreement, we received a non-refundable $4,900 deposit and are entitled to receive up to $735,000 in milestone payments upon the Burlington facility becoming licensed under the MMPR. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not expect the grant of a production license for the Burlington facility. 

Marijuana Production in the United States

In the United States it is still illegal under federal law to grow, cultivate and sell medical or adult use marijuana. However approximately thirty-two states have approved medical marijuana for use and at least ten states have approved adult use regulations. The United States Federal government justice department has released memos that will respect the individual states where strict guidelines are followed and enforced so that the health, safety and security are protected at all times by state authorities but there is no assurance that federal laws will not at any time be more vigorously enforced. If the individual state framework fails to protect the public the Federal government will act in enforcing the controlled substances act of 1970 and the DEA will enforce the federal law.

As at the date of this document, our company has not entered into any prospective or definitive arrangements to produce or distribute marijuana products in the United States and has no intention of engaging in such marijuana related activities in the United States. However, our company continually reviews opportunities and monitors legal and regulatory developments related the medical marijuana sector in both Canada and the United States. We anticipate that we may re-evaluate our participation in the United States medical marijuana sector in the event that medical marijuana production becomes federally sanctioned and, in the meantime, we plan to limit our foray into the marijuana industry to ancillary involvement based on out-licensing of our DehydraTECH technology to state licensed producers. 

On November 8, 2016 referendums held in various US states increased those areas in the USA where either medical or recreational use marijuana was state-legal. More than 50% of the US population now lives in a state where either medical or recreational marijuana use is permitted by state law, although it is still banned by US federal laws.

   Our business plan contemplates additional increases in the number of employees and other personnel over the next 12-month period to enhance operational and our in-house R&D capacity. When beneficial to do so we will continue to outsource contract employment or engagements as needed. Additional capacity may be required with product advancement or retail acceptance of our new products, we may need to retain additional personnel particularly in the fields of product manufacturing, development, sales and distribution. It is not possible to accurately project potential needs into the future based on circumstances that may or may not occur. 

Research and Development

Lexaria incurred $555,730 (2018 $492,864) in research and development expenditures during the period ending August 31, 2019. Specific R&D programs are in ongoing development and will be tightly related to our financial ability to undertake each research phase for each molecule. Due to our expanding portfolio coverage, we are continuing to examine accelerated timetable options for testing, research and development. 

The Company’s earlier plans to include in vitro absorption tests of our patented technology of molecules such as: Vitamin E, Ibuprofen, and Nicotine allowed us to perform testing on Nicotine with positive results. Our plan to conduct our first ever in vivo absorption tests on CBD also yielded positive results. Ongoing testing plans are proceeding to further define molecular compatibility, absorption rates, timing and viable formats of delivery. 

The Company continually focuses on new R&D programs to investigate potential additional commercial applications for its technology. These include, but are not limited to, ongoing programs to explore methods to integrate nanoemulsification chemistry techniques together with its technology that have demonstrated positive results to date, programs to further enhance intestinal bio absorption rates with its technology, as well as ongoing programs to expand the types and breadth of product form factors into which its technology can be applied. Depending on how many of these tests are undertaken, R&D budgets are expected to vary significantly. It is in our best interests to remain flexible at this early stage of our R&D efforts in order to capitalize on potential novel findings from early-stage tests and thus re-direct research into specific avenues that offer the most reward.

Subsidiaries

Lexaria has its wholly-owned subsidiaries; Lexaria CanPharm ULC, PoViva Corp., Lexaria Hemp Corp., Kelowna Management Services Corp. and Lexaria Pharmaceutical Corp, and our majority owned subsidiary Lexaria Nicotine LLC. On January 15, 2019, the Company announced the initial investment of $1,000,000 from Altria Ventures Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., for a 16.667% equity interest along with certain other rights in Lexaria Nicotine LLC.
