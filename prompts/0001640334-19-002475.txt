Description of Business

We specialize in the re-selling of new and used tennis and golf equipment. The concept is to source top-quality, in-demand equipment and resell it to both domestic and international customers. We have identified popular brands and models that retain their value in new and used condition.

To source in-demand equipment, our Company has established relationships with local Southwest Florida sports retailers to purchase their surplus end-of-season inventory and trade-ins. The Company also attends golf and tennis trade shows and monitors re-seller equipment events to pin-point trends in high-demand used equipment. Both Florida and California have been identified as premium geographic locations to search for and secure the desired supply of top-end equipment.

We will operate as an on-line only entity and utilize E-Bay as our primary marketing channel. We will also optimize our own website for ‘global’ search terms and internally vend equipment to a worldwide market. Because the Company relies on third-party websites such as E-bay to make its sales, such reliance on any third-party platform to generate revenues carries with it certain risks including but not necessarily limited to: the Company could violate the terms of service and lose its selling privileges, or the sites themselves could experience technical issues and/or fail. The Company will always strive to abide by the policies of any third-party platform and will endeavor to provide superior customer service. The Company will also look to improve the marketing and functionality of its own website, to act as a hedge against the risk of relying on third-party partners.

The principals of our Company have experience in both the sports of tennis and golf, and through this experience have identified high-value, high-margin equipment that re-sells profitably to both international and domestic customers. The goal is to create a unique supply chain that targets niche, valued products and their buyers. Serious golfers and tennis players are very particular about their equipment and will go to considerable lengths to secure what they are looking for in a quest to improve their game. This customer is our prime target market and our marketing approach will be to create a relationship (wherever possible) with this customer and become their ongoing equipment supplier through social media and electronic outreach.

Distribution Methods

Potential customers will find our equipment promoted through websites such as E-Bay and eventually through our own PacificSportsExchange.com website. E-Bay makes it relatively easy to ship goods to international destinations, and E-Bay also services the domestic US. market. Through E-Bay, our Company will be able to ship tennis racquets anywhere within the continental U.S.A. for an average flat rate of $8 per item. In addition to utilizing third-party websites such as E-Bay, our Company will develop a robust website of our own and undertake a key-word optimization effort that will globally rank the site for tennis and golf related keywords. While E-Bay allows for start-up companies such as ours to instantly reach a global audience, our longer-term strategy would be to have customers interact and purchase equipment directly from our website. Not only does this help with the margin-per-transaction, but also gives us an opportunity to create a long-term relationship and database with each customer. However, it must be cautioned that as website optimization occurs, especially on a global scale, this will take time and resources to accomplish, and initially E-Bay will be our key marketing channel.
Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Position in the Industry

Our Company will compete with other vendors of golf and tennis equipment. We will compete with a wide assortment of vendors from small local golf and tennis shops, to larger established vendors such as Dick’s Sporting Goods and Amazon. There is also an assortment of successful on-line vendors such as Tennis Warehouse, Midwest Sports, Holabird Sports, and Puetz Golf, among others. At first glance the retail industry appears challenging, especially when you factor in direct sales from the equipment manufacturers themselves, however, a competitive advantage could lie in the specialized nature of both our target customer and our targeted products. While we will sell to local domestic customers, our primary target market will be foreign buyers from Asia and Europe that have a penchant for specific brands and product models not available in their local markets. We have identified select new and classic equipment that is in high demand to foreign buyers, and we have identified a reliable method to source the desired equipment. Our source of in-demand equipment comes from a network of local tennis and golf shops. Located throughout Southwest Florida, these local shops and their owners are embedded within their communities and have great relationships with the local playing public; season in and season out they receive a steady supply of trade-in equipment. Our Company has found that these vendors are happy to sell this old equipment to us at a discount. Hence, our niche strategy within the larger mass market will be to service the specialized and under-served international demand with a supply of equipment that is sourced from a network of local Florida sport shops. Our Company believes that this sourcing strategy can be duplicated on the East Coast of Florida and in other warm weather states such as California and Arizona.
Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers

The key to our success will be in the quality of our leadership, and their ability to share industry knowledge and secure a reliable supply chain. Our Company will be headed by Timothy Conte, a retired educator and life-long tennis and golf enthusiast. Mr. Conte is passionate about both sports and carries a Florida United States Tennis Association (USTA) tennis ranking, as well as and a 9.2 United States Golf Association (USGA) golf handicap. At both a professional and volunteer level, Mr. Conte has made key Florida vendor/industry contacts and is thoroughly versed on the latest equipment technology. He is also aware and appreciative of classic tennis and golf equipment that stands the test of time and is still widely sought-after today. Mr. Conte is well traveled and has played both sports in Europe and in Asia. Mr. Conte is currently devoting 20 hours per week to our Company.

Our Company also benefits from the services of Jennifer Whitesides. Mrs. Whitesides is also a golf and tennis enthusiast and is involved in Florida USTA tennis instruction and carries a USGA golf handicap. Mrs. Whitesides’ main responsibility will be to secure a reliable supply chain. Golf and tennis shops, trade shows, and re-seller events of South Florida will be the initial source of equipment, followed by a structured buying campaign in California. Mrs. Whitesides will work side-by-side with Mr. Conte, leverage her existing industry contacts and ensure that the supply of equipment meets any pending demand. Mrs. Whitesides is working a total of 8 hours per week for our Company.

Both officers also monitor E-Bay for underpriced listings of tennis and golf equipment. These listings do appear from time to time and offer upside resell opportunity.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

· | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.


We may take advantage of these provisions through November 30, 2023. If certain events occur prior to November 30, 2023, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion or we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to November 30, 2023.

We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this registration statement and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosure available to smaller reporting companies.
