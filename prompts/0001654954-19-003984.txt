  ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
 
  Recent Developments
 
  Intention to Explore Strategic Opportunities
 
  On March 8, 2019, we announced that we had initiated a process to evaluate strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value. While management continues to focus on our business activities and operations, this process will consider a range of potential strategic opportunities including, but not limited to, business combinations.
 Sale of Suisun City Operations
 
 On December 24, 2018, we completed the previously announced sale of WPCS International – Suisun City, Inc., a California corporation (the “Suisun City Operations”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, dated December 10, 2018 (the “Purchase Agreement”) by and between us and World Professional Cabling Systems, LLC, a California limited liability company (the “Purchaser”). Upon the closing of the sale, the Purchaser acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, no par value per share, of Suisun City Operations, for an aggregate purchase price of $3,500,000.
 Departure and Appointment of Chief Financial Officer
 
 On February 14, 2019, our Board approved (1) the termination of Paul Commons as Chief Financial Officer and any other positions on which he served with respect to us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, and (2) the appointment of Mark Corrao as our new Chief Financial Officer, in each case effective as of February 28, 2019.
 Reverse Stock Split
  
   On March 8, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a one-for-six reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. Such amendment and ratio were previously approved by our stockholders and board of directors, respectively. As a result of the reverse stock split, every six shares of our outstanding pre-reverse split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of common stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stock holders were not affected by the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise have held a fractional share of common stock received payment in cash in lieu of any such resulting fractional shares of common stock, as the post-reverse split amounts of common stock were rounded down to the nearest full share. Unless otherwise noted, all share and pershare data included in these financial statements retroactively reflect the 1-for-6 reverse stock split.
 Business
 
  Merger
 
  On January 30, 2018, we completed our business combination with DropCar, Inc. (“Private DropCar”) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of September 6, 2017, as subsequently amended, by and among us, DC Acquisition Corporation (“Merger Sub”), and Private DropCar (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private DropCar, with Private DropCar surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). On January 30, 2018, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, we effected a 1:4 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”), and on January 30, 2018, immediately after completion of the Merger, we changed our name to “DropCar, Inc.”

  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we issued shares of our common stock to Private DropCar’s stockholders, at an exchange ratio of 0.3273 shares of our common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, for each share of (i) Private DropCar common stock and preferred stock and (ii) Private DropCar warrants, in each case, outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The exchange ratio was determined through arms’-length negotiations between us and Private DropCar.
 
  Immediately after the Merger, there were 1,301,987 shares of our common stock outstanding. Immediately after the Merger, the former security holders of Private DropCar, together with Private DropCar advisors in connection with the Merger, Alpha Capital Anstalt and Palladium Capital Advisors, owned approximately 77.1% of our outstanding common stock, with our stockholders immediately prior to the Merger owning approximately 22.9% of our outstanding common stock.
 
  In connection with the Merger, Private DropCar was deemed to be the accounting acquirer because the stockholders of Private DropCar effectively control the combined company following the Merger. The Merger was treated as a reverse acquisition.
 
  We issued 22,850 warrants and paid approximately $208,000 in cash to Palladium Capital Advisors, LLC for services rendered in connection with the exercise of outstanding warrants prior to the merger.
 
  DropCar
 
  We are a New York City based corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 18, 1997 under the name “Internet International Communications Ltd.” Pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation filed on December 23, 2004, our name was changed to “WPCS International Incorporated.” On January 30, 2018, we completed the Merger (as described above) and our name was changed to DropCar, Inc.
 
  We provide consumer and enterprise solutions to urban automobile-related logistical challenges. The DropCar business is a provider of automotive vehicle support, fleet logistics and concierge services for both consumers and businesses in automotive-related industries. In 2015, we launched our cloud-based Enterprise Vehicle Assistance and Logistics (“VAL”) platform and mobile application (“App”) to assist customer consumers and companies in reducing the costs, hassles and inefficiencies of owning or servicing vehicles in urban centers. Our VAL platform is a web-based interface facilitating our core service by coordinating the movements and schedules of our trained valets who pick up and drop off cars at dealerships, customer and other locations. The App tracks progress and provides real-time email and/or text notifications on status to customers, increasing the quality of communication and customer satisfaction. To date, we operate our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) services within the greater New York City metropolitan area and operate our business-to-business (“B2B”) services across the greater New York City metropolitan area, New Jersey, Washington D.C., Baltimore, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Expanding city populations have created a growing dependence on cars for urban mobility; however, the supply of vehicle services (i.e., garages, service centers, etc.) has continued to decrease as rising costs and other factors have made access to such services increasingly limited. To solve for these systemic urban mobility challenges, our technology captures and analyzes real-time data to dynamically optimize a rapidly growing network of professional valets across a suite of vehicle transport and high-touch support services.

  We believe that consumers value the flexibility and comfort of having a personal vehicle but are restricted by dependence on the location of garages, service centers, parking solutions and maintenance. The continued population migration into cities and corresponding general increase in real estate prices are compounding this consumer burden. We seek to solve this problem by freeing consumers from the reliance on the location of automotive infrastructure generally necessary to own a vehicle in an urban area.

  For our consumer customers, we provide a balance of increased consumer flexibility and lower cost by aggregating demand for parking and other automotive services and facilitating their fulfillment through our network of vendor partners in and around urban areas providing access and convenience to areas not currently being served. Beyond the immediate unit economic benefits of securing discounts from vendor partners based on their excess capacity, we believe there are significant opportunities for our platform to expand throughout the vehicle lifecycle and supply chain.
 
  Our business customers, including, among others, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), dealers and other service providers in automotive-related industries are increasingly challenged with consumers who have limited time to bring their vehicles for maintenance and service, making it difficult to retain valuable post-sale service contracts or scheduled consumer maintenance and service appointments with many urban customers. Additionally, many of the vehicle support centers for automotive providers (i.e., dealerships and bodywork and diagnostic shops) have moved out of urban areas, making it more challenging for these OEMs and dealers to provide convenient and efficient service for their consumer and business clientele. Similarly, shared mobility providers and other fleet managers, such as rental car companies, face a similar urban mobility challenge: transporting cars to and from service bays, rebalancing vehicle availability to meet demand and transporting vehicles from dealer lots to fleet locations.
 
  In response to this growing urban, automotive mobility challenge, we work directly with our business customers operating in automotive related industries to provide them with the option to have our valets transport vehicles to and from their businesses or their customer locations. Our business customers can leverage our services to drive new revenue from new and existing customers, including customers from within our consumer subscription base.
 
  We offer our business services at a fraction of the cost of many alternatives, including other third party services and expensive in-house resources, because our pricing model reduces and/or eliminates downtime expense while also giving clients access to a network of trained valets on demand that can be scaled up or down based on the business customer’s real-time needs. We support this model by maximizing the utilization of our employee-valet workforce across a curated pipeline available to both our consumer and business customer network.
 
  While our current business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) services generate revenue and help meet the unmet demand for vehicle support services, we are also building out a platform and customer base that positions us well for future application in automotive-related industries where vehicle ownership and utilization may become increasingly car-shared or subscription-based with transportation services and concierge service options customized to match a customers’ immediate needs. For example, certain car manufacturers are testing new services in which customers pay the manufacturer a flat fee per month to have access to a number of different vehicle models for a specified length of time. We believe that our unique blend of B2B and B2C services make us well suited to introduce and provide the services necessary to add value in this next generation of automotive subscription services.

  How DropCar Works
 
  Business-to-Consumer (“B2C”)
 
  Our customers use DropCar to reduce the cost and hassles of owning a car. We have three core B2C services:
 
  ●
  Self-Park Storage — When a B2C customer living within Manhattan or Brooklyn needs to find a monthly parking spot near their residence or other desired location, the B2C customer uses the DropCar App to locate a nearby garage with available space and can sign up for garage access on a monthly basis. This monthly self-park storage subscription ranges in price from $249 to $600 per month based on garage location, a discount to what we believe to be the typical cost of garage parking in New York City.

  ●
  Hourly Parking and Driver Services “WILL” Service — We offer a separate service for B2C customer car owners who want to avoid the hassle of finding a parking space in Manhattan, Brooklyn and surrounding cities during short time windows (i.e., for a meeting, dinner, sports game, etc.). Using the App, a B2C customer can schedule a valet to meet at a specific location and time, and the valet will remain with the vehicle until the owner returns, or the valet can continue to drive with the owner to other locations, as is common using the services provided by Uber or Lyft, except under this service, the B2C customer is in their own personal vehicle. This service turns B2C customers vehicles into a true personal mobility solution.

  ●
  Maintenance and Other Services (“DropCar 360”) — Our valets can also provide for our B2C customers’ other vehicle service-related needs, such as fueling, car washing, scheduled maintenance, and detailing. We believe these services result in higher customer satisfaction when compared to simple valet services, as well as an increased average revenue per B2C customer because of the incremental revenue generated on such services, including revenue generated by the valets time, and any additional a la carte service fees.


  Business-to-Business (“B2B”)
 
 Our B2B customers rely on us to facilitate selling, leasing, renting and sharing their vehicles at scale in urban centers. While the types of businesses we work with are continuing to expand, our current primary B2B customers include:
 
  ●
  OEMs, Dealers, and Leasing Agents — Using our technology platform and large network of readily available valets, we enable branded automobile dealerships, leasing companies, peer to peer platforms and OEMs to offer a unique level of convenience for their service center operations and customers by providing efficient pick-up and drop-off service. We also enable automotive-related companies to track and digitize the lifecycle of their vehicle movements; many of these companies have never had the technology or resources to track such data prior to our engagement. The combination of easy to access high-touch service fulfillment plus data maturation is allowing our B2B customers the ability to more quickly launch new service offerings without the need to incur the heavy up-front investments or long-term commitments historically associated with building and managing a dedicated in-house workforce. Dealers, peer to peer market places and manufacturers can leverage our fully hosted middleware and mobile App or can integrate our service into their own consumer mobile apps (or directly into the vehicle’s native software (e.g., OnStar®)) for seamless scheduling, maintenance and delivery services. In addition, our B2B customers can integrate our cost saving and convenient consumer support services and subscriptions (i.e., parking, fueling and washing, etc.) directly into their showroom sales and leasing offerings to increase the likelihood of a sale.

 Fleets and Car Sharing — Strong growth in “e-hailing” and shared mobility/car sharing services, along with the burgeoning response from the traditional rental car industry, has increased consumer expectations for more flexibility and reliability from their automotive and transportation service providers. At the same time, consumers continue to increase their sensitivity to price. As a result, businesses in these industries are moving quickly to identify opportunities to protect their operating margin while building competitive differentiation through the integration of services attractive to consumer needs.


 This trend has created highly fertile ground for us to establish ourselves as a backbone partner with companies and platforms seeking to compete in this highly competitive sector by providing the same set of logistical support services and consumer facing add-on services that our service provides to OEMs, peer to peer platforms, dealers and leasing agents. In 2018, we entered into several service agreements to provide transport, prep, vehicle registration, cleaning and maintenance services for a customer’s fleet of vehicles in a metropolitan area to support its on-demand car sharing service. These services will be provided and coordinated through access to our VAL platform, which enables the fleet managers to schedule and track movements and services via a dedicated, secure portal.
 
  ●
  Real Estate — We understand that parking spots in on-site garages often decrease the overall value of property. Developers are often able to add value by using the space that would otherwise be used for parking spots for other alternatively valuable purposes. At the same time, certain cities across the United States are placing caps on the total number of parking spaces per unit for new developments. While this may benefit developers, it may be negative for prospective tenants who own cars.


 We believe that our vehicle storage and delivery service positions us well within the new ecosystem — where our “virtual garage” provides consumers greater flexibility with transportation related solutions while helping reduce stress and costs associated with existing garages and crowded street parking.
 
  DropCar Informatics
 
 We also enable automotive-related businesses to capture, analyze and catalog critical data that is compiled into searchable databases about their customers and operations, including real time vehicle tracking, vehicle photos, vehicle inspection summaries as well as consumer profiles and preferences.
  
 We are actively integrating new tools into our platform to help businesses launch new products and services to deepen their customer relationships beyond the point of sale, including consumer facing scheduling websites and tools for marketing into our own consumer subscriber base.
 
  Vertical Integration and Future of Automotive Space
 
  ●
  Vertical Integration — Today, we leverage our ability to aggregate demand around our core services alongside our logistics and fulfillment infrastructure to form margin attributive relationships with third party vendors looking to grow their businesses. However, as our databases expand and we increase the predictability of our clients’ needs across these respective services, we may seek to acquire assets and service businesses to further try and increase margins and synergies while generating incremental investment returns derived from these assets.

  ●
  Future of Automotive Industry — Many automotive companies, rental car companies and car sharing programs are developing subscription models, peer to peer models and service portfolios to cater to increasingly personalized customer preferences. These trends are symptomatic of the broader market shift towards a car share and subscription-based economy to accommodate the greater value consumers are placing on the flexibility and option of paying for products and services on demand as opposed to traditional automobile ownership. We continue to offer our “micro logistics support services” for the vehicle lifecycle which may eventually go beyond our current mobile App, and into vehicles directly.


  Sales and Marketing
 
 We currently use select digital marketing efforts to drive awareness of our B2C and B2B businesses. B2C business development has been driven by these marketing efforts and word-of-mouth referrals. The B2B business development has been achieved through the traditional direct sales efforts by our executives to companies in the automotive supply chain, rental car, fleet, shared and peer to peer mobility industries.
 Employees
 
 As of March 11, 2019, our DropCar business had 88 full time employees and 5 part time employees, including 70 licensed drivers. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 Properties
 
 For our DropCar self-park business we have month to month agreements with a number of garage companies strategically located throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn, which among other items, permit our customers parking access. Through our large inventory of monthly subscriptions, we are able to favorably negotiate underutilized parking spaces throughout our coverage areas and cost effectively store vehicles for our B2C customers. We also have certain arrangements from time to time with garage facilities for specific event days and other parking needs where an event is seeking our valet services.
 Intellectual Property
 
 Our primary source of revenue is generated by our service offerings through our proprietary mobile App, available for download on the Apple iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store. We developed our App using a dedicated third-party code development team. We own the software code associated with our mobile App. The DropCar App centralizes and automates the management of our reservations, vehicle locations, customer service and payment to optimize customer experience, minimize costs and leverage efficiencies.
 
 Our reservation system is built on a mix of open source web applications and in-house technology developed by our technology team to enable existing users to reserve our services using mobile applications on the iPhone or Android platforms. Through our reservation system, customers have around-the-clock access to the complete, real-time availability of our services and can manage all necessary transactions electronically.
 
 We use third party software for our credit card payment processing which has been integrated directly into our application platform. This third-party payment processing software allows us to provide for accurate billing and timely payment and gives us the flexibility to scale the business.

 We designed and built our technology with the goal of providing the most convenient, efficient and reliable service possible. Our iPhone and Android applications are examples of how we continue to seek ways to improve and simplify the customer experience. We continue to invest in improving our technology platform to meet the needs of our growing business.
 
 In addition, the DropCar name and design mark are federally registered U.S. trademarks, with registrations effective until November 30, 2022 and May 1, 2023, respectively, subject to renewal.
 
  Competition
 
 With respect our B2C services, our competitors include traditional parking garages and service centers, emerging maintenance and repair mobile application providers and alternatives to traditional car ownership and leasing for personal mobility (i.e., e-hailing. car sharing, renting, etc.).
 
 While these alternatives to traditional car ownership and leasing are competitors to our B2C business, they are target clients for our B2B business services and as such are not seen as true competitors. There are, however, separate B2B focused automotive logistics and support platforms that compete with our B2B business.
 
  ●
  Traditional Parking Garages and Service Centers — Our B2C offering competes directly with on-site parking garages. Our service offering presumes that parking a car in an urban setting remains challenging and expensive. We compete with traditional valet parking facilities as well as on-site parking garages which may offer more convenient options to consumers than our services. The same competitive risks exist for local repair shops and service centers.


 We believe, however, that consumers and businesses alike are increasingly looking for vehicle support services to help clients avoid sacrificing valuable time and convenience.
 
 Historically, companies such as Luxe, which closed operations in July 2017 and subsequently sold their technology to Volvo in September 2017, and Valet Anywhere, which closed operations in July 2016, have unsuccessfully tried to build similar on-demand service models. We believe these companies failed due to multiple factors, including the use of expensive in-city garages, a parking-only focus and low valet utilization rates directed only to servicing consumers (B2C). Unlike these historical competitors, we attempt to solve for these issues by offering a self-service option priced at a positive gross margins and billed in advance of the month’s usage, and by seeking to more effectively optimize valet utilization across both B2C and B2B clients. We believe that this diversification of services and revenue streams is critical for building a more compelling and scalable vehicle support platform that is positioned to benefit from larger urban mobility trends.
 
  ●
  Emerging Maintenance and Repair Mobile Apps — Our B2C offering competes directly with new mobile applications that seek to connect local repair shops and mechanics with customers for on-site car service fulfillment, including companies such as YourMechanic, Wrench, SQKY, Filld and RepairPal. Our 360 Repair Services has been de-emphasized for the consumer since the middle of 2018 and we are assessing the future direction of this offering. We continue to offer simple maintenance services.


 Many of these competitors do not include transportation of the vehicle for servicing but bring the service to the vehicle. We believe this limits the scope of services that can be provided and also poses significant logistical challenges in busy urban environments that is likely to limit the ability to grow such operations. Moreover, our approach to consolidating such support services in parallel with our short-term and long-term parking solutions creates a simpler “one stop shop” experience which we believe is attractive to time-pressed consumers and businesses.

  ●
  B2B Automotive Logistics and Transport — Our B2B offering competes directly with other automotive logistics and transport companies such as RedCap, MyKarma and Stratim (formerly Zirx). These companies, like us, seek to work with OEMs, dealers, car sharing programs, and other automotive companies to assist in the management of fleet transportation and servicing.


 Many of these B2B competitors, including Stratim and RedCap, rely on third-party firms to provide independent contractors to ultimately fulfill their vehicle transportation services. Unlike these competitors, we are investing in our own employee-based workforce which not only increases the speed at which we can respond to the needs of our B2B clients, but we also believe that it is critically important for attracting the best talent and ensuring the highest levels of reliability. Moreover, our B2B clients enjoy the security of a clear vendor relationship, which avoids the uncertainties associated with independent contractor relationships. We believe our unique B2C value proposition and services supports confidence in our value as a logistics partner as well as provides additional opportunities to partner with us as a lead generation partner for new business.
 
  Government Regulation
 
 Other than to maintain our corporate good standing in the jurisdictions in which we operate and laws and regulations affecting employers generally, we do not believe we are currently subject to any direct material government regulations or oversight. We do not own the vehicles that are used in DropCar’s business service (other than the vehicles we own to deploy valets), nor do we currently own any of the facilities used to store or service such vehicles. Although various jurisdictions and government agencies are considering implementing legislation in response to the rise of other ride- and car-sharing enterprises, such as Uber Technologies Inc., currently no such legislation exists that we believe has jurisdiction over, or applicability to, our operations.
