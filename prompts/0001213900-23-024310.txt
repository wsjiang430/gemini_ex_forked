Item 1. Business
Overview



We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutic products for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening diseases and conditions.



Our primary focus is on the development of our lead product candidate, DefenCath™, for potential commercialization in the United States, or U.S., and other key markets. We have in-licensed the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize DefenCath and Neutrolin®. The name DefenCath is the U.S. proprietary name conditionally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, while the name Neutrolin was used in the European Union, or EU, and other territories where we received CE-Mark approval for the commercial distribution of Neutrolin as a catheter lock solution, or CLS, regulated as a medical device.



DefenCath is a novel anti-infective solution (a formulation of taurolidine 13.5 mg/mL, and heparin 1000 USP Units/mL) intended for the reduction and prevention of catheter-related infections and thrombosis in patients requiring central venous catheters, or CVCs, in clinical settings such as hemodialysis, total parenteral nutrition and oncology. Infections and thrombosis represent key complications among hemodialysis, total parenteral nutrition and cancer patients with CVCs. These complications can lead to treatment delays and increased costs to the healthcare system when they occur due to hospitalizations, need for IV antibiotic treatment, long-term anticoagulation therapy, removal/replacement of the CVC, related treatment costs, as well as increased mortality. We believe DefenCath, if approved, will address a significant unmet medical need and a potential large market opportunity.



DefenCath – United States



In late 2013, we met with the FDA, to determine the pathway for obtaining U.S. marketing approval of DefenCath as a new drug. In January 2015, the FDA designated DefenCath as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, for prevention of catheter-related blood stream infections, or CRBSIs, in patients with end stage renal disease receiving hemodialysis through a CVC. CRBSIs and clotting can be life-threatening. The QIDP designation provides five years of market exclusivity in addition to the five years granted for a New Chemical Entity, or NCE, upon approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA. In addition, in January 2015 the FDA granted Fast Track designation to DefenCath Catheter Lock Solution, a designation intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs that treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that the approved drug can reach the market expeditiously. The Fast Track designation of DefenCath provides us with the opportunity to meet with the FDA on a more frequent basis during the development process, and also ensures eligibility to request priority review of the marketing application.



We launched the Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with hemodialysis catheters in the U.S. in December 2015. The clinical trial, named Phase 3 Prospective, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Active Control Study to Demonstrate Safety and Effectiveness of DefenCath in Preventing Catheter-related Bloodstream Infection in Subjects on Hemodialysis for End Stage Renal Disease, or LOCK-IT-100, was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active control trial which was designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of DefenCath compared to the standard of care CLS, Heparin, in preventing CRBSIs, in subjects receiving hemodialysis therapy as treatment for end stage renal disease. The primary endpoint for the trial assessed the incidence of CRBSI and time to CRBSI for each study subject. The trial evaluated DefenCath relative to the active control heparin by documenting the incidence of CRBSI and the time until the occurrence of CRBSI for each study subject. Secondary endpoints were catheter patency, which was defined as required use of tissue plasminogen activating factor, or tPA, or removal of catheter due to dysfunction, and removal of catheter for any reason.











During the course of the study, in consultation with the FDA, we established the Clinical Adjudication Committee, or CAC, to critically and independently assess CRBSI while being blinded to treatment assignment. As announced in July 2018, the CAC reviewed potential cases of CRBSI in our LOCK-IT-100 study that occurred through early December 2017 and identified 28 such cases. As previously agreed with the FDA, an interim efficacy analysis was performed when the first 28 CRBSIs were identified. On July 25, 2018, we announced that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, had completed its review of the interim analysis of the data from the LOCK-IT-100 study. Based on the first 28 cases, there was a highly statistically significant 72% reduction in CRBSI relative to the control (p=0.0034). Because the pre-specified level of statistical significance was reached for the primary endpoint and efficacy had been demonstrated with no safety concerns, the DSMB recommended the study be terminated early.



Following discussions with the FDA, we proceeded with an orderly termination of LOCK-IT-100. In late January 2019, we announced the topline results of the full data set of the LOCK-IT-100 study. The study continued enrolling and treating subjects until study termination, and the final efficacy analysis was based on a total of 795 subjects.



The primary endpoint of the Phase 3 LOCK-IT-100 study was the reduction of the risk of occurrence of CRBSI by DefenCath relative to the active control of heparin. In the analysis of the full data set, a total of 41 CRBSI events were determined by the CAC. There was a 71% reduction in the risk of occurrence of CRBSIs compared with the active control of heparin, which was well in excess of the study’s assumed treatment effect size of a 55% reduction. In the DefenCath arm, the CRBSI event rate was 0.13 per 1000 catheter days, which is significantly lower than the event rate of 0.46 per 1000 catheter days in the control arm. The statistical significance of the primary endpoint in the full data set (p=0.0006) was even more impressive than that of the interim analysis (p=0.0034).



The FDA granted our request for a rolling submission and review of the New Drug Application, or NDA, that is designed to expedite the approval process for products being developed to address an unmet medical need. Although the FDA usually requires two pivotal clinical trials to provide substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness for approval of the NDA, the FDA will in some cases accept one adequate and well-controlled trial, where it is a large multicenter trial with a broad range of subjects and investigation sites with procedures to include trial quality that has demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically very persuasive effect on prevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome.



In March 2020, we began the modular submission process for the NDA for DefenCath for the prevention of CRBSI in hemodialysis patients, and in August 2020, the FDA accepted for filing the DefenCath NDA. The FDA also granted our request for priority review, which provides for a six-month review period instead of the standard ten-month review period. As we announced in March 2021, the FDA informed us in its Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) that it could not approve the NDA for DefenCath in its present form. The FDA noted concerns at the third-party manufacturing facility after a review of records requested by the FDA and provided by the contract manufacturing organization, or CMO. Additionally, the FDA required a manual extraction study to demonstrate that the labeled volume can be consistently withdrawn from the vials despite an existing in-process control to demonstrate fill volume within specifications.



In April 2021, we and the CMO met with the FDA to discuss proposed resolutions for the deficiencies identified in the CRL to us and the Post-Application Action Letter, or PAAL, received by the CMO from the FDA for the NDA for DefenCath. There was an agreed upon protocol for the manual extraction study identified in the CRL, which now has been successfully completed. Addressing the FDA’s concerns regarding the qualification of the filling operation necessitated adjustments in the process and generation of additional data on operating parameters for manufacture of DefenCath. We and the CMO determined that additional process qualification was needed with subsequent validation to address these issues.











The FDA did not request additional clinical data and did not identify any deficiencies related to the data submitted on the efficacy or safety of DefenCath from LOCK-IT-100.  In draft labeling discussed with the FDA, the FDA added that the initial approval will be for the limited population of patients with kidney failure receiving chronic hemodialysis through a central venous catheter.  This is consistent with our request for approval pursuant to the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs, or LPAD. LPAD, passed as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, is a new program intended to expedite the development and approval of certain antibacterial and antifungal drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patients with unmet needs. LPAD provides for a streamlined clinical development program involving smaller, shorter, or fewer clinical trials and is intended to encourage the development of safe and effective products that address unmet medical needs of patients with serious bacterial and fungal infections. We believe that LPAD will provide additional flexibility for the FDA to approve DefenCath to reduce CRBSIs in the limited population of patients with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis through a central venous catheter.



On February 28, 2022, we resubmitted the NDA for DefenCath to address the CRL issued by the FDA. In parallel, our third-party manufacturer submitted responses to the deficiencies identified at the manufacturing facility in the PAAL issued by the FDA concurrently with the CRL. The FDA had stated that it expected all corrections to facility deficiencies to be complete at the time of resubmission so that all corrective actions may be verified during an onsite evaluation of the manufacturing facility in the next review cycle. On March 28, 2022, we announced that the resubmission of the NDA for DefenCath had been accepted for filing by the FDA. The FDA considered the resubmission as a complete, Class 2 response with a six-month review cycle. The CMO notified us that an onsite inspection by the FDA was conducted that resulted in FORM FDA 483 observations that are being addressed. The CMO submitted responses to the inspectional observations along with a corrective action plan and requested a meeting with the FDA to discuss. We were also notified by our supplier of heparin, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for DefenCath, that an inspection by the FDA for an unrelated API, resulted in a Warning Letter due to deviations from good manufacturing practices for the unrelated API.



On August 8, 2022, we announced receipt of a second CRL from the FDA regarding the DefenCath NDA. The FDA stated that the DefenCath NDA cannot be approved until deficiencies conveyed to the CMO and the heparin API supplier are resolved to the satisfaction of the FDA. There were no other requirements identified by the FDA for us prior to resubmission of the NDA. Validation of manufacturing with heparin from an alternative supplier is underway to prepare for resubmission of the NDA in the event that the Warning Letter at our current API supplier remains unresolved. Corrective actions have been implemented to address the inspectional observations at the CMO and are under review by the FDA.




As part of the NDA review process, the FDA has also notified us that although the tradename DefenCath was conditionally approved, the FDA now has identified potential confusion with another pending product name that is also under review. The ultimate acceptability of our proposed tradename is dependent upon which application is approved first. As a precaution, we are preparing to submit an alternative proprietary name to the FDA which will undergo review.



We intend to pursue additional indications for DefenCath use as a CLS in populations with unmet medical needs that may also represent potentially significant market opportunities. While we are continuing to assess these areas, potential future indications may include use as a CLS to reduce CRBSIs in total parenteral nutrition patients using a central venous catheter and in oncology patients using a central venous catheter.



We were granted a deferral by the FDA under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, that requires sponsors to conduct pediatric studies for NDAs for a new active ingredient, such as taurolidine in DefenCath, unless a waiver or deferral is obtained from the FDA. A deferral acknowledges that a pediatric assessment is required but permits the applicant to submit the pediatric assessment after the submission of an NDA. We have made a commitment to conduct the pediatric study after approval of the NDA for use in adult hemodialysis patients. Pediatric studies for an approved product conducted under PREA may qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which, if granted, would provide an additional six months of marketing exclusivity. DefenCath would then have the potential to receive a total marketing exclusivity period of 10.5 years, including exclusivity pursuant to NCE and QIDP.



Neutrolin – International



In the EU, Neutrolin was regulated as a Class 3 medical device. In July 2013, we received CE Mark approval for Neutrolin. In December 2013, we commercially launched Neutrolin in Germany for the prevention of CRBSI, and maintenance of catheter patency in hemodialysis patients using a tunneled, cuffed central venous catheter for vascular access.  











In September 2014, the TUV-SUD and The Medicines Evaluation Board of the Netherlands, or MEB, granted a label expansion for Neutrolin for these same expanded indications for the EU. In December 2014, we received approval from the Hessian District President in Germany to expand the label to include use in oncology patients receiving chemotherapy, IV hydration and IV medications via central venous catheters. The expansion also adds patients receiving medication and IV fluids via central venous catheters in intensive or critical care units (cardiac care unit, surgical care unit, neonatal critical care unit, and urgent care centers). An indication for use in total parenteral nutrition was also approved.



In September 2019, our registration with the Saudi Arabia Food and Drug Administration, or the SFDA, expired. As a result, we cannot sell Neutrolin in Saudi Arabia and do not intend to pursue renewal of our registration with the SFDA.



As announced in May 2022, we began the process of winding down our operations in the EU and discontinued Neutrolin sales in both the EU and the Middle East at the end of 2022.



Additional Development Possibilities



In addition to DefenCath, we have sponsored a pre-clinical research collaboration for the use of taurolidine as a possible treatment for rare pediatric tumors. In February 2018, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to taurolidine for the treatment of neuroblastoma in children. We may seek one or more strategic partners or other sources of capital to help us develop and commercialize taurolidine for the treatment of neuroblastoma in children.



We have previously filed intellectual property for expanded uses of taurolidine as a platform compound for use in certain medical devices. Patent applications have been filed in several indications, including wound closure, surgical meshes, and wound management. We would need to seek to establish development/commercial partnerships for these programs to advance.



The FDA regards taurolidine as a new chemical entity and therefore it is currently regulated as an unapproved new drug. In the future, we may pursue product candidates that would involve devices impregnated with taurolidine, and we believe that at the current time such products would be combination products subject to device premarket submission requirements (while subject also, under review by the FDA, to the standards for drug approvability). Consequently, given that there is no appropriate predicate medical device currently marketed in the U.S. on which a 510(k) approval process could be based and that taurolidine is not yet approved in any application, we anticipate that we would be required to submit a premarket approval application, or PMA, for marketing authorization for any medical device indications that we may pursue for devices containing taurolidine. In the event that an NDA for DefenCath is approved by the FDA, the regulatory pathway for these medical device product candidates may be revisited with the FDA. Although there may be no appropriate predicate, de novo Class II designation can be proposed, based on a risk assessment and a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.



DefenCath



Market Opportunity



Central venous catheters, or CVCs, and peripherally inserted central catheters, or Central Catheters, are an important and frequently used method for accessing the vasculature in hemodialysis (a form of dialysis where the patient’s blood is circulated through a dialysis filter), administering chemotherapy and basic fluids in cancer patients and for cancer chemotherapy, long term antibiotic therapy, and total parenteral nutrition (complete or partial dietary support via intravenous nutrients).




Bloodstream infections resulting from the use of central catheters, known as CRBSIs or Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections, or CLABSIs, can result in significant morbidity and increased rates of hospital admissions, readmissions and mortality. One of the major and common risk factors for all patients requiring CVCs is CRBSIs and the clinical complications associated with them. The total annual cost for treating CRBSI episodes and their related complications in the U.S. is up to $2.3 billion, with approximately 250,000 CRBSI episodes per year (Becker’s Hospital Review).












According to the 2022 United States Renal Disease System, reporting data from 2020, there were nearly 808,000 End-Stage-Renal-Disease, or ESRD, patients on permanent hemodialysis in the U.S. Of these, nearly 108,000 hemodialysis patients were new patients diagnosed with ESRD during the year they were receiving dialysis through a CVC. Patients are typically located in various care settings including inpatient hospitals and outpatient dialysis clinics. Kidney failure patients can include ESRD, Acute Kidney Injury, or AKI and Chronic Kidney Disease, or CKD, populations that crash land into dialysis. Patients that present in the hospital have an average length of stay of 13.3 days and additionally high 30-day readmission rates both for same diagnosis and all-cause with the all-cause readmissions being higher.



Biofilm build up is the pathogenesis of both infections and thrombotic complications in central venous catheters. Prevention of CRBSI and inflammatory complications requires both removal of pathogens from the internal surface of the catheter to prevent the systemic dissemination of organisms contained within the biofilm as well as an anticoagulant to retain blood flow during dialysis. Biofilm forms when bacteria adhere to surfaces in aqueous environments and begin to excrete a slimy, glue-like substance that can anchor them to various types of materials, including intravenous catheters. The presence of biofilm has many adverse effects, including the ability to release bacteria into the blood stream. The current standard of catheter care is to instill a heparin lock solution at a concentration of 1000 u/mL into each catheter lumen immediately following treatment, in order to prevent clotting between dialysis treatments. However, a heparin lock solution provides no protection from the risk of infection.



Currently, there are no pharmacologic agents approved in the U.S. for the prevention or reduction of CRBSI in CVCs. We believe there is a significant need for prevention of CRBSI in the hemodialysis patient population as well as for other patient populations utilizing central venous catheters and peripherally inserted central catheters, such as oncology/chemotherapy, and total parenteral nutrition.



DefenCath is a non-antibiotic, broad-spectrum antibacterial, antifungal and anticoagulant combination that is active against common microbes including antibiotic-resistant strains and in addition may prevent biofilm formation. DefenCath had been reviewed as a New Molecular Entity, or NME, with priority review. In addition, DefenCath has been granted a QIDP designation by the FDA. We believe that using DefenCath as an anti-infective catheter-lock solution will significantly reduce the incidence of life-threatening catheter-related blood stream infections, thus reducing the need for local and systemic antibiotics while prolonging catheter function. There are currently no products approved by the FDA with an indication for use as a catheter lock solution.



Competitive Landscape



The drug and medical device industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. DefenCath’s current and future competitors include large as well as specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and large and specialty medical device companies. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly more experience in the development and commercialization of drugs and medical devices. Further, the development of new treatment methods could render DefenCath non-competitive or obsolete.



We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of DefenCath are efficacy and safety, as well as pricing and reimbursement. Given that there are no approved catheter lock solutions with antimicrobial properties in the U.S., and that the current standard of care is heparin, we believe that with adequate reimbursement there is an opportunity for DefenCath to become the new standard of care as a CLS in the U.S. market, if approved by FDA. We are not aware of any potentially competitive CLS which are approved or under development by other companies in the U.S. A development stage product from Citius Pharmaceuticals Inc. is being studied for use to salvage an infected CVC, causing a catheter related blood stream infection.



Manufacturing/Supply Chain



We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities related to the production of our products. All our manufacturing processes currently are, and we expect them to continue, to be outsourced to third parties. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of drug product for use both commercially and in clinical trials. We intend to continue this practice in the future.











With regards to taurolidine, an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of DefenCath, we have a Drug Master File filed with the FDA. There is a master commercial supply agreement between the third-party manufacturer, and us in place from August 2018. We have two sources for the other key API, Heparin sodium.



We have historically utilized a European based CMO for the production of DefenCath for the U.S. market. We have validated the manufacturing process for DefenCath at this CMO utilizing one source of heparin API, and are in the process of validating a second source of heparin API.




We are confident that this CMO has adequate capacity to produce the volumes needed, and that there exists a sufficient number of potential alternate sources for the drug substances required to produce our products, as well as third-party manufacturers, that we will be able to find alternate suppliers and third-party manufacturers in the event that our relationship with any supplier or third-party manufacturer deteriorates. The process for selecting and qualifying an alternative contract manufacturer and for completing the technology transfer to such a manufacturer to the point of enabling commercialization of the product may take several years.



We previously announced an agreement with Alcami Corporation, or Alcami, a U.S. based contract manufacturer with proven capabilities for manufacturing commercial sterile parenteral drug products. Alcami may function as an alternate manufacturing site for DefenCath for the U.S. market. As part of the technology transfer and validation of the manufacturing process at Alcami, we would also expect to qualify an alternate source of heparin API sourced from a major U.S. supplier.



United States Government Regulation



The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Our products may be classified by the FDA as a drug or a medical device depending upon the indications for use or claims. Because certain of our product candidates are considered as medical devices and others are considered as drugs for regulatory purposes, we intend to submit applications to regulatory agencies for approval or clearance of both medical devices and pharmaceutical product candidates.



In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the FDA’s implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, and during the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among other actions. Any agency enforcement action and/or any related impact could have a material adverse effect on us.



Drug Approval Process



The research, development, and approval process in the United States and elsewhere is intensive and rigorous and generally takes many years to complete. The typical process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug may be marketed in the United States includes:

● | pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests performed under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | human clinical studies to evaluate the drug’s safety and effectiveness for its intended uses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review of whether the facility in which the drug is manufactured, processed, packaged, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued quality and FDA review of clinical trial sites to determine whether the clinical trials were conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA, and approval of the application by the FDA to allow sales of the drug.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------












During pre-clinical testing, studies are performed with respect to the chemical and physical properties of candidate formulations. These studies are subject to GLP requirements. Biological testing is typically done in animal models to demonstrate the activity of the compound against the targeted disease or condition and to assess the apparent effects of the new product candidate on various organ systems, as well as its relative therapeutic effectiveness and safety. An IND application must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before studies in humans may commence.



Clinical trial programs in humans generally follow a three-phase process. Typically, Phase 1 studies are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers or, on occasion, in patients afflicted with the target disease. Phase 1 studies are conducted to determine the metabolic and pharmacological action of the product candidate in humans and the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In Phase 2, studies are generally conducted in larger groups of patients having the target disease or condition in order to validate clinical endpoints, and to obtain preliminary data on the effectiveness of the product candidate and optimal dosing. This phase also helps determine further the safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are generally conducted in patients having the target disease or condition to provide sufficient data for the statistical proof of effectiveness and safety of the product candidate as required by United States and foreign regulatory agencies. Typically, two Phase 3 trials are required for marketing approval.



In the case of products for certain serious or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing may be done in patients with the disease rather than in healthy volunteers. Because these patients are already afflicted with the target disease or condition, it is possible that such studies will also provide results traditionally obtained in Phase 2 studies. These studies are often referred to as “Phase 1/2” studies. However, even if patients participate in initial human testing and a Phase 1/2 study is carried out, the sponsor is still responsible for obtaining all the data usually obtained in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.



Before proceeding with a study, sponsors may seek a written agreement known as a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial. Among other things, SPAs can cover clinical studies for pivotal trials whose data will form the primary basis to establish a product’s efficacy. SPAs help establish up-front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of a clinical trial design to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding on the FDA if new circumstances arise. An SPA may only be modified with the agreement of the FDA and the trial sponsor or if the director of the FDA reviewing division determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA.



Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. The committee can also stop a clinical trial for an overwhelming demonstration of efficacy, based on pre-defined, stringent statistical parameters and ethical considerations.



The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.



IND sponsors are required to submit a number of reports to the FDA during the course of a development program. For instance, sponsors are required to make annual reports to the FDA concerning the progress of their clinical trial programs as well as more frequent reports for certain serious adverse events. Sponsors must submit a protocol for each clinical trial, and any subsequent protocol amendments to the FDA. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their clinicaltrials.gov website. Moreover, under the 21st Century Cures Act, manufacturers or distributors of investigational drugs for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must have a publicly available policy concerning expanded access to investigational drugs.












United States law requires that studies conducted to support approval for product marketing be “adequate and well controlled.” In general, this means that either a placebo or a product already approved for the treatment of the disease or condition under study must be used as a reference control. The recently passed 21st Century Cures Act, however, provides for FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as patient experience data, real world evidence, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries. Studies must also be conducted in compliance with good clinical practice requirements, and informed consent must be obtained from all study subjects.



In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.



The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. An assessment of the REMS must also be conducted at set intervals. Following product approval, a REMS may also be required by the FDA if new safety information is discovered and the FDA determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks of the drug.



The clinical trial process for a new compound can take ten years or more to complete. The FDA may prevent clinical trials from beginning or may place clinical trials on hold at any point in this process if, among other reasons, it concludes that study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Trials may also be prevented from beginning or may be terminated by institutional review boards, or IRBs, who must review and approve all research involving human subjects and amendments thereto. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. This includes the IRB receiving information concerning unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing authorization. Similarly, adverse events that are reported after marketing authorization can result in additional limitations being placed on a product’s use and, potentially, withdrawal of the product from the market.



Following the completion of a clinical trial, the data are analyzed by the sponsoring company to determine whether the trial successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness and whether a product approval application may be submitted. In the United States, if the product is regulated as a new drug, an NDA must be submitted and approved by the FDA before commercial marketing may begin. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning the safety and effectiveness of the compound from laboratory, animal, and human clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product quality and stability, and proposed product labeling.



Each domestic and foreign manufacturing establishment, including any contract manufacturers that we may decide to use, must be listed in the NDA and must be registered with the FDA. The application generally will not be approved until the FDA conducts a manufacturing inspection, approves the applicable manufacturing process for the drug product, and determines that the facility is in compliance with current cGMP requirements. Moreover, FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to confirm that the applicable clinical trials were conducted in accordance with GCPs.



Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, the FDA assesses and receives application user fees for reviewing an NDA, as well as annual program fees for commercial manufacturing establishments and for approved products. These fees can be significant. Fee waivers, reductions or refunds are available in certain circumstances. One basis for a waiver or refund of the application user fee is if the applicant is a “small business” generally defined as employing fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, no approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs, which are further described below, are also not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. Under certain circumstances, orphan products may also be exempt from product and establishment fees.



Each NDA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability. Following this review, the FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.











Once accepted for filing, the FDA’s review of an application may involve review and recommendations by an independent FDA advisory committee. The FDA must refer applications for drugs that contain active ingredients, including any ester or salt of the active ingredients that have not previously been approved by the FDA to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter a summary for not referring it to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer drugs to advisory committees when it is determined that an advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial to the regulatory decision-making process, including the evaluation of novel products and the use of new technology. An advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, which review, evaluate, and make a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.



After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval and describes all the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.



Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved therapeutic uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that warning statements be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS or otherwise limit the scope of any approval.



Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs



The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of certain drug products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.



To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if the product will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy, safety, or public health factors. If Fast Track designation is obtained, drug sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. A Fast Track product is also eligible to apply for accelerated approval and priority review.



The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines, of the 60-day filing date for new molecular entities.











Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for the Fast Track designation features as described above, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, and a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review.



Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.



A final new program to expedite the development of drug products is the LPAD, which was passed as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. LPAD allows for the FDA’s determination of safety and effectiveness to reflect the risk-benefit profile of the drug in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection and the availability of alternative treatments in the limited population. Under LPAD, a sponsor may request drug approval for an antibacterial or antifungal drug if the drug is intended to treat a serious life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs. The drug may be approved for the limited population notwithstanding a lack of evidence to fully establish a favorable benefit-risk profile in a broader population. The FDA must provide prompt advice to sponsors seeking approval under LPAD to enable them to plan a development program. If approved under LPAD, certain post-marketing requirements would apply, such as required labeling and advertising statements and pre-distribution submission of promotional materials to FDA. If after approval for a limited population, a product receives a broader approval, the FDA may remove such post-marketing restrictions. While a drug may only be approved for a limited population under this program, the 21st Century Cures Act states that it is not intended to restrict the prescribing of antimicrobial drugs or other products by healthcare professionals.



Exclusivity



For approved drug products, market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA provide periods of regulatory exclusivity, which gives the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug.



Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application in which the applicant, in part, relies on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. Limited changes must be pre-approved by the FDA via a suitability petition.



Five years of exclusivity are available to New Chemical Entities, or NCEs. A NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule, that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds, or other noncovalent derivatives, such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate, of the molecule, responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review and make an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for an application submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application, however, may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if the applicant submits a certification stating that the patents listed by the NCE sponsor in FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book, are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which approval is sought. Five-year exclusivity will also not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.











Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity period described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the required time frames, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or Orange Book listed patent protection cover the drug are extended by six months. Moreover, pediatric exclusivity attaches to all formulations, dosage forms, and indications for products with existing marketing exclusivity or patent life that contain the same active moiety as that which was studied.



The Orphan Drug Act also provides incentives for the development of drugs intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, which generally are diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or affecting more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug available in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a drug already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug as the already approved drug. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. If granted, prior to product approval, Orphan Drug Designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is generally entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity.



For certain infectious disease products, the above discussed exclusivity periods may be further extended under the FDA’s qualified infectious disease product program. A qualified infectious disease product, or QIDP, is an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or qualifying pathogens designated by the FDA that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. Subject to the specified statutory limitations, a drug that is designated as a QIDP and is approved for the use for which the QIDP designation was granted will receive a 5-year extension to any exclusivity for which the application qualifies upon approval. For example, if the FDA approves an NDA for a drug designated as a QIDP, the NCE exclusivity period is extended to ten years and the FDA may not accept applications for nine years. Moreover, if a product is designated as a QIDP and an orphan product, the orphan product exclusivity period is extended to twelve years. These extensions are in addition to any extension that an application may be entitled to under the pediatric exclusivity provisions. To receive a QIDP designation, the sponsor must request that the FDA designate the product as such prior to the submission of an NDA. This designation may not be withdrawn except if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact. QIDPs are also eligible for Fast Track status and priority review.



In March 2020, we were granted a deferral by the FDA under the PREA, that requires sponsors to conduct pediatric studies for NDAs for a new active ingredient, such as taurolidine in DefenCath, unless a waiver or deferral is obtained from the FDA. A deferral acknowledges that a pediatric assessment is required but permits the applicant to submit the pediatric assessment after the submission of an NDA. We have made a commitment to conduct the pediatric study after approval of the NDA for use in adult hemodialysis patients. Pediatric studies for an approved product conducted under PREA may qualify for pediatric exclusivity, which if granted would provide an additional six months of marketing exclusivity. DefenCath would then have the potential to receive a total marketing exclusivity period of 10.5 years, including exclusivity pursuant to NCE and QIDP.



Post Approval Requirements



Significant legal and regulatory requirements also apply after FDA approval to market under an NDA. These include, among other things, requirements related to adverse event and other reporting, product tracking and tracing, suspect and illegitimate product investigations and notifications, product advertising and promotion and ongoing adherence to cGMPs, as well as the need to submit appropriate new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. The FDA also enforces the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians. The FDA enforces these requirements through, among other ways, periodic announced and unannounced facility inspections.











The FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Physicians, in their independent professional medical judgment, may prescribe legally available products for unapproved indications that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Pharmaceutical companies, however, are allowed to promote their drug products only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including, but not limited to, criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment, and refusal of government contracts.



The regulatory framework applicable to the production, distribution, marketing, and/or sale, of our product candidates may change significantly from the current descriptions provided herein in the time that it may take for any of our product candidates to reach a point at which an NDA is approved. Moreover, individual states may have laws and regulations that we must comply with, such as laws and regulations concerning licensing, promotion, sampling, distribution, and reporting.



Overall research, development, and approval times depend on a number of factors, including the period of review at the FDA, the number of questions posed by the FDA during review, how long it takes to respond to the FDA’s questions, the severity or life-threatening nature of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, the availability of clinical investigators and eligible patients, the rate of enrollment of patients in clinical trials, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in the clinical trials.



Medical Device Approval Process



In addition to our lead product candidate DefenCath, which is subject to regulation by the FDA as a drug, we may develop other products that could be regulated as medical devices in the United States. The FDA considers a product to be a device, and subject to the FDA regulation, if it meets the definition of a medical device in the FDCA, which states that a device is an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory which is:

● | recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The FDA regulates the design, development, clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution, import and export, sale and promotion of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies or a product is a Class I device, all medical devices must receive either 510(k) clearance or an approved pre-market application, or PMA, from the FDA before they may be commercially distributed in the U.S. In addition, certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. Unlike approved drug products, there are no market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA for products regulated as medical devices.



To obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device, a pre-market notification to the FDA must be submitted demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. For a new device to be found “substantially equivalent” to one or other legally marketed predicate devices, the new device must have: 1) the same intended use as a predicate; and 2) either a) the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or b) different technological characteristics, but the information submitted must not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and must demonstrate substantial equivalence. The FDA attempts to respond to a 510(k) pre-market notification within 90 days of submission, but as a practical matter, pre-market clearance can take significantly longer, potentially up to one year or more.











The PMA process is much more demanding and uncertain than the 510(k) pre-market notification process and must be supported by extensive clinical, laboratory, technical and other information, including at least one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation conducted under an investigational device exemption (IDE). The FDA has 180 days to review an accepted PMA, although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years.



The FDA has informed us that it regards taurolidine as a new chemical entity and therefore an unapproved new drug. Consequently, for any other products that we intend to develop as a medical device, there is currently no appropriate predicate device currently marketed in the U.S. on which a 510(k) approval process could be based. As a result, we will be required to submit a premarket approval application for marketing authorization for these indications. In the event that the NDA for DefenCath is approved by the FDA, the regulatory pathway for these taurolidine product candidates can be revisited with the FDA.  Although there will presumably still be no appropriate predicate, de novo Class II designation can be proposed, a process that provides a pathway to classify novel medical device for which there is no legally marketed predicate device, based on a risk assessment and a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.



After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including:




● | Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, which require manufacturers to have a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of finished medical devices; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which govern product labels and labeling, prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved, or off-label, uses and impose other restrictions on labeling and promotional activities; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device listing and establishment registration; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance requirements; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers evaluate and investigate potential adverse events and malfunctions, and report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulations requiring the reporting of any device corrections or removals if the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or remedy a violation of the FDCA which may present a risk to health; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is a risk to health. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Our manufacturing facilities, as well as those of certain of our suppliers, are subject to periodic and for-cause inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to verify compliance with the QSR and other regulatory requirements.



Pricing and Reimbursement 



Inpatient Reimbursement



Initially, and contingent upon FDA approval of DefenCath, we plan to sell DefenCath primarily to inpatient acute-care hospitals and outpatient dialysis clinics. Most of the nation’s inpatient acute-care hospitals are paid under the inpatient prospective payment system, or IPPS. The IPPS pays a flat rate based on the average charges across all hospitals for a specific diagnosis, regardless of whether that particular patient costs more or less. Under the IPPS, each case is categorized into a diagnosis-related group, or DRG to determine the base rate and for specific products that meet various levels of criteria there is an established New Technology Add-on Payment, or NTAP. There are three levels of criteria required to be eligible to receive an NTAP and they are:



1. Product must meet “newness” criteria;

2. Product must meet “substantial clinical evidence”; and

3. Product must meet certain pricing thresholds.











The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, recently created the alternative NTAP approval pathways for certain technologies. Under the alternative NTAP pathway, devices that obtain breakthrough designation and drugs that obtain QIDP designation from the FDA need only meet the cost criterion because the CMS assumes that those products meet the newness and substantial clinical improvement criteria.




After submission and review of our NTAP application by CMS, we have been granted a conditional alternative NTAP for the inpatient setting. This reimbursement provides for a maximum per hospital stay equivalent to $14,259, per patient. With this level of reimbursement in the inpatient setting, we plan to launch DefenCath post-approval in hospitals first, while outpatient reimbursement remains under determination by CMS. The NTAP is conditioned upon the DefenCath NDA receiving final FDA approval prior to July 1, 2023. We have submitted a duplicate NTAP application to CMS, should final approval of the DefenCath NDA not occur prior to July 1, 2023.



We will seek further CMS reimbursement for DefenCath, contingent upon approval by the FDA, in other catheter indications and settings of care, such as (i) oncology patients and total parenteral nutrition patients through relevant hospital inpatient DRGs, (ii) additional NTAP payments, (iii) outpatient ambulatory payment classifications, or APCs, (iv) the End-Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System, or ESRD PPS, base payment, or (v) under the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies, or DMEPOS, Fee Schedule, depending on the setting of care.




Outpatient Reimbursement



For outpatient reimbursement, we plan to seek separate reimbursement as a drug. We have engaged CMS in preliminary discussions concerning the reimbursement for DefenCath as a separately billable product based on statutory definition of a renal dialysis service, or RDS, as codified in 42 C.F.R §413.171. We do not believe DefenCath is a RDS and should be separately billable due to the following reasons:

● | DefenCath is not an item or service included in the composite rate for RDS as of December 31, 2010;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath is not an erythropoiesis stimulating agent; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath is not a drug or biological that was furnished to individuals for the treatment of ESRD and for which payment was (prior to January 1, 2011) made separately; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath’s first expected indication for use, which is pending FDA review, is not as a treatment for ESRD, rather as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial for the reduction of CRBSIs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath is not essential for the delivery of maintenance dialysis; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath is subject to CMS’s established mechanism used by ESRD facilities to identify and be paid separately for non-ESRD-related drugs and biologicals; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we are planning to use DefenCath for additional indications such as total parental nutrition and oncology settings; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DefenCath is not systemically delivered into a patients’ body; it dwells in the lumen of the CVC until the lumen is accessed, at which time it is aspirated; DefenCath may potentially be beneficial in preventing CRBSIs in any population requiring the use of central venous catheters. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If approved as a separate billable product, reimbursement of DefenCath’s cost would be the average selling price, or ASP, plus 4.3% for CMS, plus 6% for commercially insured patients.











If CMS determines DefenCath is a renal dialysis service, we believe DefenCath would be eligible for, and would obtain under the ESRD PPS, the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment, or TDAPA; however, these qualifications cannot be determined until the FDA approves DefenCath and CMS evaluates our request for coverage in a quarterly review. If determined to be TDAPA, reimbursement of DefenCath would be calculated based on its ASP. To be eligible for TDAPA, a new renal drug or biologic must be:




● | Approved by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Commercially available; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assigned a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identified as having an end action effect that treats or manages a condition or conditions associated with ESRD; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Identified as not fitting into an established ESRD PPS functional category; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Designated by CMS as a renal dialysis service. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Although we cannot anticipate changes in reimbursement requirements and mechanisms in the coming years, CMS has acknowledged TDAPA payment mechanisms maybe adjusted to encourage innovation for this patient population. These new payment calculations are yet to be determined. We believe that DefenCath would meet the criterion of being a new renal dialysis product used to treat or manage a condition associated with ESRD, because taurolidine, the active antimicrobial agent in DefenCath, is a new chemical entity that has not been approved for use in the U.S. by the FDA.



In anticipation that the CMS and private payers will require that we demonstrate the cost effectiveness of DefenCath as part of the reimbursement review and approval process, we have submitted posters and abstracts to support our health economic analysis and continue to commission and develop health economic evaluations to support this review in the context of the prospective use of DefenCath in dialysis. Of additional importance, we are pursuing opportunities to partner with healthcare systems prior to the approval of DefenCath to demonstrate the product’s clinical and economic effectiveness.



Foreign Regulatory Requirements



We and our collaborative partners may be subject to widely varying foreign regulations, which may be quite different from those of the FDA, governing clinical trials, manufacture, product registration and approval, and pharmaceutical sales. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, we or our collaboration partners must obtain a separate approval for a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries prior to the commencement of product marketing in those countries. In certain countries, regulatory authorities also establish pricing and reimbursement criteria. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, under current United States law, there are restrictions on the export of products not approved by the FDA, depending on the country involved and the status of the product in that country.



International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.



Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These laws and regulations range from comprehensive device approval requirements for our medical device product to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements can be complex and could increase. We may not be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals in such countries and we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. In addition, the export of certain of our products which have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to FDA export restrictions. Any failure to obtain product approvals in a timely fashion or to comply with state or foreign medical device laws and regulations may have a serious adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.











Intellectual Property



On January 30, 2008, we entered into a License and Assignment Agreement, or the NDP License Agreement, with ND Partners, LLC, or NDP. Pursuant to the NDP License Agreement, NDP granted us exclusive, worldwide licenses for certain antimicrobial catheter lock solutions, processes for treating and inhibiting infections, a biocidal lock system and a taurolidine delivery apparatus, and the corresponding United States and foreign patents and applications (the “NDP Technology”). We acquired such licenses and patents through our assignment and assumption of NDP’s rights under certain separate license agreements by and between NDP and Dr. Hans-Dietrich Polaschegg, Dr. Klaus Sodemann, and Dr. Johannes Reinmueller. NDP also granted us exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to use and display certain trademarks in connection with the NDP Technology. As consideration in part for the rights to the NDP Technology, we paid NDP an initial licensing fee of $325,000 and granted NDP an equity interest in our Company consisting of 73,107 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2010. In addition, we are required to make payments to NDP upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. Certain of the milestone payments are to be made in the form of shares of common stock currently held in escrow for NDP, and other milestone payments are to be paid in cash. The maximum aggregate number of shares issuable upon achievement of milestones and the number of shares initially held in escrow is 29,109 shares of common stock. The maximum aggregate amount of cash payments upon achievement of milestones is $3,000,000 with $2,500,000 remaining at December 31, 2022. Events that trigger milestone payments include but are not limited to the reaching of various stages of regulatory approval processes and certain worldwide net sales amounts.



During the year ended December 31, 2013, a milestone payment of $500,000 was earned by NDP upon the first issuance of the CE Mark for Neutrolin. Under Article 6 of the NDP License Agreement, we were obligated to make a milestone payment of $500,000 to NDP upon the first issuance of a CE Mark for a licensed product, which payment was payable to NDP within 30 days after such issuance. On April 11, 2013, we entered into an amendment to the NDP License Agreement which extended the milestone payment from within 30 days after such issuance to within twelve months after the achievement of such issuance. As consideration for the amendment, we issued NDP a five-year warrant to purchase 25,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share. The warrant, which was exercisable immediately upon issuance, expired in April 2018. In January 2014, the $500,000 milestone payment due to NDP was converted into 10,000 Series C-3 non-voting preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share. These warrants expired during the year ended December 31, 2020.



During the year ended December 31, 2014, a certain milestone was achieved resulting in the release of 7,277 shares held in escrow. The number of shares held in escrow as of December 31, 2022 is 21,832 shares of common stock. There were no milestones achieved in 2022 or 2021.



The NDP License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the earlier of (i) the expiration of the last patent claim under the NDP License Agreement in a given country, or (ii) the payment of all milestone payments and release of all shares of our common stock held in escrow under the NDP License Agreement. Upon the expiration of the NDP License Agreement in each country, we will have an irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free exclusive license to the NDP Technology in such country. The NDP License Agreement also may be terminated by NDP if we materially breach or default under the NDP License Agreement and that breach is not cured within 60 days following the delivery of written notice to us, or by us on a country-by-country basis upon 60 days prior written notice. If the NDP License Agreement is terminated by either party, our rights to the NDP Technology will revert back to NDP.



We believe that the patents and patent applications we have licensed pursuant to the NDP License Agreement cover effective solutions to the various medical problems discussed previously when using taurolidine in clinical applications, and specifically in hemodialysis applications. Our patent portfolio consists of 6 issued U.S. patents and 11 pending U.S. patent applications; 19 issued foreign patents and 45 pending foreign patent applications. Additional patent applications will be filed to cover any additional related subject matter developed. The patents cover additional applications using taurolidine in, among others, sutures, hydrogels, meshes, transdermal and biofilm products.
