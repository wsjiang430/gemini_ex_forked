Item 1.  Business

In this report, “JAKKS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to JAKKS Pacific, Inc., its subsidiaries and our majority owned joint venture.

Company Overview

We are a leading multi-line, multi-brand toy company that designs, produces, markets and distributes toys and related products, consumables and related products, electronics and related products, kids indoor and outdoor furniture, and other consumer products. We focus our business on acquiring or licensing well-recognized trademarks and brand names, most with long product histories (“evergreen brands”). We seek to acquire these evergreen brands because we believe they are less subject to market fads or trends. We also develop proprietary products marketed under our own trademarks and brand names, and have historically acquired complementary businesses to further grow our portfolio. For accounting purposes, our products have been divided into three segments: (i) U.S. and Canada, (ii) International and (iii) Halloween. Segment information with respect to revenues, assets and profits or losses attributable to each segment is contained in Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements contained below in Item 8.

We continually review the marketplace to identify and evaluate popular and evergreen brands and product categories that we believe have the potential for growth. We endeavor to generate growth within these lines by:
●    creating innovative products under our established licenses and brand names;
●    adding new items to the branded product lines that we expect will enjoy greater popularity;
●    infusing innovation and technology when appropriate to make them more appealing to today’s kids; and
●    focusing our marketing efforts to enhance consumer recognition and retailer interest.

Our Business Strategy

In addition to developing our own proprietary brands and marks, licensing popular trademarks enables us to use these high-profile marks at a lower cost than we would incur if we purchased these marks or developed comparable marks on our own. By licensing trademarks, we have access to a far greater range of marks than would be available for purchase. We also license technology developed by unaffiliated inventors and product developers to enhance the design and functionality of our products.

We sell our products through our in-house sales staff and independent sales representatives to toy and mass-market retail chain stores, department stores, office supply stores, drug and grocery store chains, club stores, toy specialty stores and wholesalers. Our two largest customers are Wal-Mart and Target, which accounted for approximately 25.3% and 21.5%, respectively, of our net sales in 2018. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2018.

Our Growth Strategy

 Key elements of our growth strategy include:

●    Expand Core Products. We manage our existing and new brands through strategic product development initiatives, including introducing new products, modifying existing products and extending existing product lines to maximize their longevity. Our marketing teams and product designers strive to develop new products or product lines to offer added technological, aesthetic and functional improvements to our extensive portfolio.

●    Enter New Product Categories. We use our extensive experience in the toy and other consumer product industries to evaluate products and licenses in new product categories and to develop additional product lines. We began marketing licensed classic video games for simple plug-in use with television sets and expanded into several related categories by infusing additional technologies such as motion gaming and through the licensing of this category from our current licensors, such as Disney and Viacom which owns Nickelodeon.

●    Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We supplement our internal growth with selected strategic acquisitions. In October 2016, we acquired the operating assets of the C’est Moi™ performance makeup and youth skincare product lines whose distribution was limited primarily to Asia. We launched a full line of makeup and skincare products branded under the C’est Moi name in the U.S. to a limited number of retail customers in 2018. Sales of our C’est Moi products were not material in 2018 and we expect to grow the brand and sales over time. We will continue focusing our acquisition strategy on businesses or brands that we believe have compatible product lines and/or offer valuable trademarks or brands.
●    Acquire Additional Character and Product Licenses. We have acquired the rights to use many familiar brand and character names and logos from third parties that we use with our primary trademarks and brands. Currently, among others, we have license agreements with Nickelodeon®, Disney and Warner Bros.®, as well as with the licensors of the many popular licensed children’s characters previously mentioned, among others. We intend to continue to pursue new licenses from these entertainment and media companies and other licensors. We also intend to continue to purchase additional inventions and product concepts through our existing network of inventors and product developers.

●    Expand International Sales. We believe that foreign markets, especially Europe, Australia, Canada, Latin America and Asia, offer us significant growth opportunities. In 2018, our sales generated outside the United States were approximately $127.8 million, or 22.5% of total net sales. We intend to expand our international sales and further expand distribution agreements in Europe to capitalize on our experience and our relationships with foreign distributors and retailers. We expect these initiatives to contribute to our international growth in 2019.

●    Capitalize On Our Operating Efficiencies. We believe that our current infrastructure and operating model can accommodate growth without a proportionate increase in our operating and administrative expenses, thereby increasing our operating margins.

The execution of our growth strategy, however, is subject to several risks and uncertainties and we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience growth in, or maintain our present level of net sales (see “Risk Factors,” in Item 1A). For example, our growth strategy will place additional demands upon our management, operational capacity and financial resources and systems. The increased demand upon management may necessitate our recruitment and retention of additional qualified management personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit and retain qualified personnel or expand and manage our operations effectively and profitably. To effectively manage future growth, we must continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to train, motivate and manage our work force. While we believe that our operational, financial and management information systems will be adequate to support our future growth, no assurance can be given they will be adequate without significant investment in our infrastructure. Failure to expand our operational, financial and management information systems or to train, motivate or manage employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Moreover, implementation of our growth strategy is subject to risks beyond our control, including competition, market acceptance of new products, changes in economic conditions, our ability to obtain or renew licenses on commercially reasonable terms and our ability to finance increased levels of accounts receivable and inventory necessary to support our sales growth, if any.

Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we can identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable acquisition terms, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to sustain growth.

Finally, our acquisition strategy involves a number of risks, each of which could adversely affect our operating results, including difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or product lines, assimilating new facilities and personnel and harmonizing diverse business strategies and methods of operation; diversion of management attention from operation of our existing business; loss of key personnel from acquired companies; and failure of an acquired business to achieve targeted financial results.
 Industry Overview

According to Toy Industry Association, Inc., the leading toy industry trade group, the United States is the world’s largest toy market, followed by Japan and Western Europe. Total retail sales of toys, excluding video games, in the United States, were approximately $21.6 billion in 2018. We believe the two largest United States toy companies, Mattel and Hasbro, collectively hold a dominant share of the domestic non-video toy market. In addition, hundreds of smaller companies compete in the design and development of new toys, the procurement of character and product licenses, and the improvement and expansion of previously introduced products and product lines.

Over the past several years, the toy industry has experienced substantial consolidation among both toy companies and toy retailers. We believe that the ongoing consolidation of toy companies provides us with increased growth opportunities due to retailers’ desire to not be entirely dependent upon a few dominant toy companies. Retailer concentration also enables us to ship products, manage account relationships and track point of sale information more effectively and efficiently.

Products

We focus our business on acquiring or licensing well-recognized trademarks or brand names, and we seek to acquire evergreen brands which are less subject to market fads or trends. Generally, our license agreements for products and concepts call for royalties ranging from 1% to 21% of net sales, and some may require minimum guarantees and advances. Our principal products include:

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We sell all of our products through our own in-house sales staff and independent sales representatives to toy and mass-market retail chain stores, department stores, office supply stores, drug and grocery store chains, club stores, toy specialty stores and wholesalers. Our three largest customers in 2017 were Wal-Mart, Target and Toys ‘R’ Us, which accounted for approximately 54.6% of our net sales. In 2018, our two largest customers, Wal-Mart and Target, accounted for approximately 25.3% and 21.5%, respectively, of our net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2018. We generally sell products to our customers on open account with payment terms typically varying from 30 to 90 days or, in some cases, pursuant to letters of credit. For sales outside of the United States, we may also purchase credit insurance to mitigate the risk, if any, of nonpayment. From time to time, we allow our customers credits against future purchases from us in order to facilitate their retail markdown and sales of slow-moving inventory. We also sell our products through e-commerce sites, including Walmart.com, Target.com, and Amazon.com®.

We contract the manufacture of most of our products to unaffiliated manufacturers located in The People’s Republic of China (“China”). We sell the finished products to our customers, many of whom take title to the goods in Hong Kong or China. These methods allow us to reduce certain operating costs and working capital requirements. We also contract the manufacture of certain products from Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited (“Meisheng”), which involved payment to Meisheng of approximately $35.1 million and $36.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Meisheng owns 17.8% of our outstanding common stock, and Zhao Xiaoqiang, one of our directors, is executive director of Meisheng. A portion of our sales originate in the United States, so we hold certain inventory in our warehouses and fulfillment facilities. To date, a majority of all of our sales has been to customers based in the United States. We intend to continue expanding distribution of our products into foreign territories and, accordingly, we have:

●     entered into a joint venture in China,
●     engaged representatives to oversee sales in certain foreign territories,
●     engaged distributors in certain foreign territories,
●     established direct relationships with retailers in certain foreign territories,
●     opened sales offices in Canada, Europe and Mexico,
●     opened distribution centers in Canada and Europe, and
●    expanded in-house resources dedicated to product development and marketing of our lines.
  
Outside of the United States, we currently sell our products primarily in Europe, Australia, Canada, Latin America and Asia. Sales of our products abroad accounted for approximately $127.8 million, or 22.5% of our net sales in 2018 and approximately $134.0 million, or 21.9% of our net sales in 2017. We believe that foreign markets present an attractive opportunity, and we plan to intensify our marketing efforts and further expand our distribution channels abroad.

We establish reserves for allowances provided to our customers, including discounts, pricing concessions, promotional allowances and allowances for anticipated breakage or defective product, at the time of shipment. The reserves are determined as a percentage of sales based upon either historical experience or upon estimates or programs agreed upon with our customers.

We obtain, directly, or through our sales representatives, orders for our products from our customers and arrange for the manufacture of these products as discussed below. Cancellations generally are made in writing, and we take appropriate steps to notify our manufacturers of these cancellations. We may incur costs or other losses as a result of cancellations.

We maintain a full-time sales and marketing staff, many of whom make on-site visits to customers for the purpose of showing product and soliciting orders for products. We also retain a number of independent sales representatives to sell and promote our products, both domestically and internationally. Together with retailers, we occasionally test the consumer acceptance of new products in selected markets before committing resources to large-scale production.

7

We publicize and advertise our products in trade and consumer magazines and other publications, market our products at international, national and regional toy and other specialty trade shows, conventions and exhibitions and carry on cooperative advertising programs with toy and mass market retailers and other customers which include the use of print and television ads and in-store displays. We also produce and broadcast television commercials for several of our product lines, if we expect that the resulting increase in our net sales will justify the relatively high cost of television advertising.

Product Development

Each of our product lines has an in-house manager responsible for product development. The in-house manager identifies and evaluates inventor products and concepts and other opportunities to enhance or expand existing product lines or to enter new product categories. In addition, we create proprietary products to fully exploit our concept and character licenses. Although we have the capability to create and develop products from inception to production, we also use third-parties to provide a portion of the sculpting, sample making, illustration and package design required for our products in order to accommodate our increasing product innovations and introductions. Typically, the development process takes from three to nine months from concept to production and shipment to our customers.

We employ a staff of designers for all of our product lines. We occasionally acquire other product concepts from unaffiliated third parties. If we accept and develop a third party’s concept for new toys, we generally pay a royalty on the sale of the toys developed from this concept, and may, on an individual basis, guarantee a minimum royalty. Royalties payable to inventors and developers generally range from 1% to 5% of the wholesale sales price for each unit of a product sold by us. We believe that utilizing experienced third-party inventors gives us access to a wide range of development talent. We currently work with numerous toy inventors and designers for the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products.

Safety testing of our products is done at the manufacturers’ facilities by quality control personnel employed by us or by independent third-party contractors engaged by us. Safety testing is designed to meet or exceed regulations imposed by federal and state, as well as applicable international governmental authorities, our retail partners, licensors and the Toy Industry Association. We also closely monitor quality assurance procedures for our products for safety purposes. In addition, independent laboratories engaged by some of our larger customers and licensors test certain of our products.
Manufacturing and Supplies

Most of our products are currently produced by overseas third-party manufacturers, which we choose on the basis of quality, reliability and price. Consistent with industry practice, the use of third-party manufacturers enables us to avoid incurring fixed manufacturing costs, while maximizing flexibility, capacity and production technology. Substantially all of the manufacturing services performed overseas for us are paid for on open account with the manufacturers. To date, we have not experienced any material delays in the delivery of our products; however, delivery schedules are subject to various factors beyond our control, and any delays in the future could adversely affect our sales. Currently, we have ongoing relationships with over eighty different manufacturers. We believe that alternative sources of supply are available to us although we cannot be assured that we can obtain adequate supplies of manufactured products. We may also incur costs or other losses as a result of not placing orders consistent with our forecasts for product manufactured by our suppliers or manufacturers for a variety of reasons including customer order cancellations or a decline in demand.

Although we do not conduct the day-to-day manufacturing of our products, we are extensively involved in the design of product prototypes and production tools, dyes and molds for our products and we seek to ensure quality control by actively reviewing the production process and testing the products produced by our manufacturers. We employ quality control inspectors who rotate among our manufacturers’ factories to monitor the production of substantially all of our products.

The principal raw materials used in the production and sale of our toy products are plastics, zinc alloy, plush, printed fabrics, paper products and electronic components, all of which are currently available at reasonable prices from a variety of sources. Although we do not directly manufacture our products, we own the majority of the tools, dyes and molds used in the manufacturing process, and these are transferable among manufacturers if we choose to employ alternative manufacturers. Tools, dyes and molds represent a substantial portion of our property and equipment with a net book value of $17.0 million in 2017 and $15.8 million in 2018; substantially all of these assets are located in China.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
We routinely pursue protection of our products through some form or combination of intellectual property right(s). We file patent applications where appropriate to protect our innovations arising from new development and design, and as a result, possess a portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and abroad. Most of our products are produced and sold under trademarks owned by or licensed to us. In recent years, our rate of filing new trademark applications has increased. We also register certain aspects of some of our products with the U.S. Copyright Office. In the same vein, we enforce our rights against infringers because we recognize our intellectual property rights are significant assets that contribute to our success. Accordingly, while we believe we are sufficiently protected and the duration of our rights are aligned with the lifecycle of our products, the loss of some of these rights could have an adverse effect on our financial growth expectations and business operations.
Competition

Competition in the toy industry is intense. Globally, certain of our competitors have greater financial resources, larger sales and marketing and product development departments, stronger name recognition, longer operating histories and benefit from greater economies of scale. These factors, among others, may enable our competitors to market their products at lower prices or on terms more advantageous to customers than those we could offer for our competitive products. Competition often extends to the procurement of entertainment and product licenses, as well as the marketing and distribution of products and the obtaining of adequate shelf space. Competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In each of our product lines we compete against one or both of the toy industry’s two dominant companies, Mattel and Hasbro. In addition, we compete in our Halloween costume lines with Rubies. We also compete with numerous smaller domestic and foreign toy manufacturers, importers and marketers in each of our product categories.
9

Seasonality and Backlog

In 2018, approximately 65.0% of our net sales were made in the third and fourth quarters. Generally, the first quarter is the period of lowest shipments and sales in our business and in the toy industry and therefore it is also the least profitable quarter due to various fixed costs. Seasonality factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. However, our seasonal products are primarily sold in the spring and summer seasons. Our results of operations may also fluctuate as a result of factors such as the timing of new products (and related expenses) introduced by us or our competitors, the theatrical releases of licensed brands, the advertising activities of our competitors, delivery schedules set by our customers and the emergence of new market entrants. We believe, however, that the low retail price of most of our products may be less subject to seasonal fluctuations than higher priced toy products.

We ship products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by our customers, who generally request delivery of products within three to six months of the date of their orders for orders shipped FOB China or Hong Kong and within three days for orders shipped domestically (i.e., from one of our warehouses). Because customer orders may be canceled at any time, often without penalty, our backlog may not accurately indicate sales for any future period.

Government and Industry Regulation

Our products are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (“CPSA”), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), the Flammable Fabrics Act (“FFA”) and the regulations promulgated there under, and various other regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions. The CPSA and the FHSA enable the Consumer Products Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to exclude from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety regulations or otherwise create a substantial risk of injury, and articles that contain excessive amounts of a banned hazardous substance. The FFA enables the CPSC to regulate and enforce flammability standards for fabrics used in consumer products. The CPSC may also require the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles. Similar laws exist in some states and cities and in various international markets. We maintain a quality control program designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws.
Employees

As of February 28, 2019, we employed 626 people, all of whom are full-time employees, including three executive officers. We employed 361 people in the United States, 9 people in Canada, 4 people in Mexico, 150 people in Hong Kong, 74 people in China, 22 people in the United Kingdom, 2 people in France and 4 people in Germany. We believe that we have good relationships with our employees. None of our employees are represented by a union. 
Environmental Issues

We may be subject to legal and financial obligations under environmental, health and safety laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. We are not currently aware of any material environmental liabilities associated with any of our operations.
