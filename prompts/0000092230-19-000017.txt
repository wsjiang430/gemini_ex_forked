Competition
The financial services industry is highly competitive and constantly evolving. BB&T's subsidiaries compete actively with national, regional and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, securities dealers, mortgage bankers, finance companies and insurance companies. In recent years, competition has increased from companies not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and BHCs. Consumers have the opportunity to select from a variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives. The industry frequently sees merger activity, which affects competition by eliminating some regional and local institutions, while strengthening the franchises of acquirers. For additional information concerning markets, BB&T's competitive position and business strategies and recent government interventions, see "Market Area" above and "General Business Development" below.
General Business Development
BB&T is a regional FHC and maintains a long-term focus on a strategy that includes expansion of asset size and diversification in terms of revenues and sources of profitability. This strategy encompasses both organic growth and mergers or acquisitions of complementary banks and financial businesses.
Merger and Acquisition Strategy
BB&T's merger and acquisition strategy focuses on meeting the following criteria:

• | the organization must be a good fit with BB&T's culture;


• | the merger or acquisition must be strategically attractive;


• | any risks must be identified and mitigation plans put in place to ensure any risks fall within BB&T's risk appetite; and


• | the transaction must meet BB&T's financial criteria.

BB&T's growth in business, profitability and market share has historically been enhanced by strategic mergers and acquisitions. BB&T will assess future opportunities, primarily within or contiguous to BB&T's existing footprint, based on market conditions and may pursue economically advantageous acquisitions of insurance agencies, specialized lending businesses and fee income generating financial services businesses. Regulatory actions, such as the orders more fully discussed in the "BSA/AML and Suspicious Activity" section below, can limit BB&T's and Branch Bank's ability to pursue mergers and acquisitions for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities.
As previously discussed, on February 7, 2019, BB&T entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and between BB&T and SunTrust, pursuant to which SunTrust will merge with and into BB&T, with BB&T as the surviving entity in the merger. During 2018, BB&T acquired Regions Insurance. During 2016, BB&T acquired National Penn and Swett & Crawford. 
Regulatory Considerations
The extensive regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the DIF and the stability of the financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. In addition to banking laws and regulations, BB&T is subject to various other laws, regulations, supervision and examination by other regulatory agencies, all of which directly or indirectly affect the operations and management of BB&T and its ability to make distributions to shareholders.
The description below summarizes the significant state and federal laws to which BB&T currently is subject. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions summarized. The descriptions below do not summarize all possible or proposed changes in current laws or regulations. 
Financial Regulatory Oversight
U.S. financial services firms, including BB&T, are subject to significant regulatory oversight. The Dodd-Frank Act is extensive, complex and comprehensive legislation that impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization. The Dodd-Frank Act has led to numerous and far-reaching changes that affect financial institutions.
Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other laws are subject to further rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by the applicable federal regulators. BB&T will continue to evaluate the impact of any new regulations so promulgated, including changes in regulatory costs and fees, modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the CFPB and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions, among others. 
As a BHC and a FHC under federal law, BB&T is subject to regulation under the BHCA and the examination and reporting requirements of the FRB. Branch Bank, a North Carolina state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the NCCOB, the FDIC and the CFPB.
BB&T Corporation 6

In November 2018, the FRB finalized a new confidential rating system that will apply to all BHCs with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. Under the new rating system, component ratings will be assigned for capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls; however, a standalone composite rating will not be assigned. To be considered "well managed" under the new rating system, a firm must be rated "Satisfactory" or "Satisfactory Watch" for each of its three component ratings. Initial ratings will be assigned in 2019.
State and federal law govern the activities in which Branch Bank engages, the investments it makes, and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect its operations. Branch Bank is also affected by the actions of the FRB as it implements monetary policy.
In addition to federal and state banking laws and regulations, BB&T and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in securities underwriting, dealing, brokerage, investment advisory and insurance activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations as well as supervision and examination by other federal and state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, FINRA, and NYSE.
FHC Regulation
Under current federal law, as a BHC, BB&T has elected to become a FHC, which allows it to offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related thereto, securities underwriting, insurance and merchant banking. In order to maintain its status as a FHC, BB&T and all of its affiliated IDIs must be well-capitalized and well-managed and have at least a satisfactory CRA rating. The FRB has responsibility for overseeing compliance with these requirements. If the FRB determines that a FHC is not well-capitalized or well-managed, the FHC has a period of time to comply, but during the period of noncompliance, the FRB can place any limitations on the FHC that it believes to be appropriate. Furthermore, if the FRB determines that a FHC has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities.
Most of the financial activities that are permissible for FHCs also are permissible for a bank's "financial subsidiary," except for insurance underwriting, insurance company portfolio investments, real estate investments and development, and merchant banking, which must be conducted by a FHC. In order for a financial subsidiary of a bank to engage in permissible financial activities, federal law requires the parent bank (and its sister-bank affiliates) to be well-capitalized and well-managed; the aggregate consolidated assets of all of that bank's financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of its consolidated total assets or $50 billion; the bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating; and, if that bank is one of the 100 largest national banks, it must meet certain financial rating or other comparable requirements.
Current federal law also establishes a system of functional regulation under which the FRB is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, but BHC affiliates are principally regulated by functional regulators such as the FDIC for state nonmember bank affiliates, the SEC for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates. Certain activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in the bank without the bank being deemed a "broker" or a "dealer" in securities for purposes of functional regulation. Although states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable areas.
Resolution Planning
FRB and FDIC regulations require "covered companies" such as BB&T and systemically important financial institutions such as Branch Bank to file, maintain and update plans for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (a "living will"). Both the FRB and the FDIC must review and evaluate BB&T's and Branch Bank's living wills and are authorized to impose restrictions on growth and activities or operations if deemed necessary. The public portions of the resolution plans are available in the Additional Disclosures section of the Investor Relations site at bbt.investorroom.com/additional-disclosures.
CCAR and Stress Test Requirements
FRB rules require BB&T to submit annual capital plans based on pre-defined stress scenarios. BB&T is also required to collect and report certain related data on a monthly and quarterly basis to allow the FRB to monitor progress against the annual capital plan. BB&T may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the FRB and that has not received any objections from the FRB. A capital distribution can only occur if, after giving effect to the distribution, all minimum regulatory capital ratios will be maintained, including a post-stress Basel III CET1 ratio of at least 4.5%. See Table 30 for additional information about Basel III requirements. The FRB did not object to BB&T's 2018 capital plan. 
The FRB conducts an annual supervisory stress test and requires that BB&T conduct a separate mid-cycle stress test, file the results of such test with the FRB and publicly disclose details of the scenario and the impact on its capital. The FDIC requires Branch Bank to conduct annual company-run stress tests. BB&T's annual and mid-cycle stress test results are available on its website at bbt.investorroom.com/additional-disclosures. 
7 BB&T Corporation

The start date of the annual stress test cycle is January 1 of the following calendar year. The capital plan period starts July 1 of the following calendar year. A BHC can only make capital distributions as provided for in its capital plan.
FRB rules limit the amount of capital that can be distributed by CCAR banks to shareholders outside of an approved capital plan without seeking prior approval from the FRB. Additionally, the FRB rules contain a blackout period in the second quarter of each year during which a firm cannot change its capital distribution plan. BB&T is not subject to the qualitative assessment of CCAR for BHCs as BB&T's total consolidated assets are between $50 billion and $250 billion. BB&T has maintained and intends to maintain the processes and infrastructure to facilitate future compliance. See the "Risk Factors" section for additional information regarding capital requirements, including discussion over the pending merger with SunTrust.
In April 2018, the banking regulators issued a proposal to simplify capital rules for large banks. The proposal introduces a "stress capital buffer," which would in part integrate the forward-looking stress test results with the non-stress capital requirements. The result would produce capital requirements for large banking organizations that are firm-specific and risk-sensitive and reduce the overall number of capital ratios that must be met. The stress capital buffer would equal the decrease in a firm's CET1 capital ratio in CCAR plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. A bank's stress capital buffer requirement would be subject to a floor of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
In May 2018, the EGRRCPA was enacted to modify stress test requirements based on the total consolidated assets of a BHC. Effective 18 months after enactment, BHCs with total consolidated assets of between $10 billion and $250 billion will no longer be required to conduct company-run stress tests on an on-going basis. The FRB will have discretionary authority to subject a BHC with more than $100 billion in assets to enhanced prudential standards, including periodic company-run stress tests. Additionally, the FRB stress tests for BHCs with total consolidated assets of between $100 billion and $250 billion would be required on a periodic, rather than annual, basis. For both company-run, and FRB-run stress tests, EGRRCPA reduces the number of required test scenarios from three to two (baseline and "severely adverse"), eliminating the "adverse" scenario. Refer to the Basel III section for additional disclosures regarding the impact of the EGRRCPA.
In October 2018, the federal banking agencies proposed revisions that would tailor rules for large banking companies based on risk profile. The proposed rules would create five broad categories of firms, with each category having a specific set of tailored regulatory requirements. Based on the proposal, firms with between $250 billion and $700 billion in assets, and less than $75 billion in certain other risk related exposures, would no longer be subject to the advanced approaches calculation of risk-based capital and would also be permitted to opt-out of AOCI capital impact. Additionally, the federal banking agencies proposed changes to applicability thresholds for liquidity requirements that would amend the full LCR such that BHC's with assets between $250 billion and $700 billion, and less than $75 billion in certain other risk related exposures, would be subject to a reduced full LCR.
On February 5, 2019, the FRB notified banks with less than $250 billion in assets that they will not need to participate in the 2019 supervisory stress test. However, BB&T may need to provide additional information as a result of the pending merger with SunTrust. 
Acquisitions
BB&T complies with numerous laws related to its acquisition activity. Under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the FRB.
Current federal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and BHCs without geographic limitation, and a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to market share limitations, regulatory approvals and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time. After a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to privately negotiated acquisition transactions.
FRB rules prohibit a financial company from combining with another company if the ratio of the resulting company's liabilities exceeds 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.
Other Safety and Soundness Regulations
The FRB has enforcement powers over BHCs and their nonbanking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders, civil money penalties or other actions.
BB&T Corporation 8

There also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to depositors and the FDIC insurance fund in the event the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, the FRB requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and to commit financial resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise. In addition, the "cross-guarantee" provisions of federal law require IDIs under common control to reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the DIF as a result of the insolvency or potential failure of commonly controlled IDIs. The FDIC's claim for reimbursement under the cross-guarantee provisions is superior to claims of shareholders of the IDI or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and nonaffiliated holders of subordinated debt.
Banking regulators also have broad enforcement powers over Branch Bank, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of Branch Bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including, among other things, when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.
Payment of Dividends; Capital Requirements
The Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The majority of the Parent Company's revenue is from dividends paid by Branch Bank, which are limited by laws and regulations. In addition, BB&T and Branch Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized elsewhere in this section. Banking regulators have indicated that dividends should generally only be paid if (1) net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. BB&T's future capital actions will depend on the FRB's review of BB&T's annual capital plans.
North Carolina law states that, provided a bank does not make distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North Carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper.
The federal banking agencies are required to take "prompt corrective action" in respect of financial institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five categories for this purpose: "well-capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." To be considered "well-capitalized," an IDI must maintain minimum capital ratios and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. Additionally, failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation, and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards.
In addition, failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.
Basel III
The U.S. capital requirements follow the accord of the BCBS. The Company currently qualifies as a standardized approach banking organization under the FRB's Basel III capital framework rules. The rules stipulate the risk-based capital requirements applicable to BHCs and IDIs, define the components of capital and address other areas affecting banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The rules also address risk weights and other items affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios, and the rules use a more risk-sensitive approach than the pre-Basel III rules.
Institutions with greater than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in foreign assets are considered advanced approaches banking organizations, which results in a more complex calculation of risk-weighted assets that includes an assessment of the impact of operational risk, among other differences. In addition, advanced approaches institutions have additional reporting requirements and must calculate capital under both the standardized approach and the advanced approaches and use the more conservative result. BB&T would become subject to these requirements upon exceeding either of the asset thresholds. As discussed in the "CCAR and Stress Test Requirements" section, in October 2018, the federal banking agencies proposed revisions that would tailor rules for large banking companies based on risk profile. See the "Risk Factors" section for additional information regarding capital requirements, including discussion over the pending merger with SunTrust.
9 BB&T Corporation

The Basel III rules, among other things, (1) include a capital measure referred to as CET1; (2) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of Tier 1 common equity and additional Tier 1 capital instruments meeting specified requirements; (3) define Tier 1 common equity narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to Tier 1 common equity and not to the other components of capital; and (4) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments from capital as compared to prior regulations.
The Basel III rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that generally range from 0% for U.S. government securities to 600% for certain equity exposures, with a maximum risk weight classification of 1,250% for certain securitizations. This results in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In addition, the rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.
The Basel III rules also establish more conservative ratio levels for well-capitalized status. In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, all banks must hold additional capital, referred to as the capital conservation buffer (which is in the form of common equity), to avoid being subject to limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to officers. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer was phased-in over four years, through January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer requirements do not currently result in any limitations on distributions or discretionary bonuses for Branch Bank.
In October 2017, the federal banking agencies proposed revisions that would simplify compliance with certain aspects of capital rules. A majority of the proposed simplifications would apply solely to banking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches capital rule. The proposed rules simplify application of regulatory capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, and capital issued by a consolidated subsidiary of a banking organization and held by third parties (noncontrolling interest), and; revisions to the treatment of certain acquisition, development, or construction exposures. In addition, the federal banking agencies have deferred the final phase-in and increased risk-weighting associated with CET1 deductions indefinitely for non-advanced approaches banks.
On December 21, 2018, the banking regulators issued a final rule that would revise the agencies' regulatory capital rules. The rule identifies which allowances under the new current expected credit losses accounting standard would be eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital, provides banking organizations the option to phase in the day-one effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard over a three year period, and amends certain regulatory disclosure requirements consistent with the new accounting standard. In addition, the FRB announced that covered banking organizations that have adopted the new accounting standard will not include the effect of it on their provisioning for purposes of supervisory stress testing through the 2021 cycle. In addition, BHCs required to perform company-run stress tests as part of CCAR will be required to incorporate CECL into those stress tests starting in the 2020 cycle. However, the FRB will not issue supervisory findings on those firms' allowance estimations in the CCAR exercise through 2021.
Effective upon enactment of the EGRRCPA, the banking agencies require depository institutions to assign a heightened risk weight of 150% to high volatility CRE exposures, as defined in the new law. In addition, the bill amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to exclude a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for qualifying institutions, effective upon enactment. BB&T began to report both items under the new rules of the bill for the second quarter of 2018.
See the "Liquidity" section in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information about BB&T's liquidity requirements.
See the "Capital" section in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information about BB&T's capital requirements.
HMDA Regulations
The CFPB issued final rules changing the reporting requirements for lenders under the HMDA. The new rules expand the range of transactions subject to these requirements to include most securitized residential mortgage loans and credit lines. The rules also increase the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. BB&T began collecting the expanded data on January 1, 2018.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
During 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act significantly changed corporate income tax law by reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system, allowing for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property, and eliminating the deductibility of DIF assessments. While the tax law was effective for the 2018 tax year, BB&T recognized certain effects in 2017. Refer to "Note 11. Income Taxes" for additional disclosures regarding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Volcker Rule
The Volcker Rule prohibits IDIs and their affiliates from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options for their own account. The rule provides certain exemptions and also clarifies that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian. Banking entities were required to conform proprietary trading activities to the final rule by July 21, 2015.
The rule also imposed limits on certain relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The rule became effective on July 21, 2017 for purposes of conforming investments in and relationships with certain funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. These requirements did not have a material impact on BB&T's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
DIF Assessments
Branch Bank's deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each IDI poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.
The FDIC adopted a final rule that imposed a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of the assessment base, after making certain adjustments, for banks with total assets of at least $10 billion. The surcharge became effective July 1, 2016 and ended on September 30, 2018 at which time the DIF reached the target level. BB&T incurred incremental regulatory charges of $63 million for 2018, $84 million for 2017 and $42 million for 2016 while the surcharge was imposed.
Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations
In connection with its lending and leasing activities, Branch Bank is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and their respective state law counterparts.
CFPB
The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the laws referenced above, fair lending laws and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products.
The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.
The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including mortgage origination disclosures, minimum underwriting standards and ability to repay, high-cost mortgage lending, and servicing practices.
Patriot Act
The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to cooperate in the prevention, detection and prosecution of international money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The Patriot Act contains anti-money laundering measures affecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The Patriot Act includes the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, which requires such financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions' operations. The Patriot Act imposes substantial obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and processes to detect, prevent and report money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on business. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.

BSA/AML and Suspicious Activity
BB&T is subject to a number of anti-money laundering laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States. AML requirements are primarily derived from the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the financial system from being used by criminals to hide illicit proceeds and to impede terrorists' ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, BSA/AML laws and regulations require financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain adequate AML related controls can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage.
BB&T has established and continues to maintain an AML program designed to ensure that, at a minimum, BB&T is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to AML and anti-terrorist financing initiatives. The AML program provides for a system of internal controls to ensure that appropriate due diligence and, when necessary, enhanced due diligence, including obtaining and maintaining appropriate documentation, is conducted at account opening and updated, as necessary, through the course of the client relationship. The AML program is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the AML program requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the AML program is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Non-compliance with BSA/AML laws or failure to maintain adequate policies and procedures can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage, and federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a bank merger, BHC acquisitions or other expansionary activity. 
During December 2016, Branch Bank entered into a consent order with the FDIC and the NCCOB and in January 2017, BB&T entered into a cease and desist order with the FRB and NCCOB. These orders call for corrective actions and enhancements to address certain internal control deficiencies within the BSA/AML Compliance Program. No criminal activity has been identified as the result of such deficiencies, and no financial penalty was levied. BB&T has made significant progress in addressing matters identified in the consent order, as well as the cease and desist order, and continues to devote significant resources to its BSA/AML program.
In June 2018, the FDIC and the NCCOB terminated their consent order with Branch Bank related to internal control within the BSA/AML Compliance Program. No money laundering activity was identified and no financial penalty was levied. The NCCOB also announced it has exited a similar order jointly issued with the FRB in January 2017. BB&T continues to work closely with the FRB to resolve its continuing order. Since early 2016, BB&T has made substantial enhancements to its AML compliance program, including significant investments in system upgrades, process improvements and the hiring and placement of a highly experienced AML team to oversee these efforts.
Beginning in 2018, BB&T is subject to new provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act: "Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions." These new requirements, among other things, require BB&T to collect information on the beneficial ownership and controlling person of legal entity clients and then verify their identity.
The U.S. Treasury's OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities, or countries, identified as "Specially Designated Nationals," such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These rules require the blocking of assets held by, and prohibit transfers of property to such individuals, entities or countries. Blocked assets, such as property or bank deposits, cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. BB&T maintains an OFAC program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject BB&T to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.
Privacy
Federal law contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions, including those provided under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), and Regulation P, which require among other things that financial institutions provide an annual notice describing their privacy policies. Regulation P, which became effective September 17, 2018, contains an exception to the annual notice requirement. To qualify for the annual notice exception, financial institutions must not share nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties about consumers except as described in the statutory exceptions. If a financial institution shares consumer information with unaffiliated third parties only in this manner, a financial institution is no longer required to provide an annual privacy notice and is not required to provide consumers with a right to opt out of information sharing. The amendments do not affect a financial institution's obligation to provide an initial privacy notice to all consumers. In addition, the amendments do not affect a financial institution's obligation to provide a right to opt out of information sharing that may be required by other statutes, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

CRA
The CRA requires Branch Bank's primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: "Outstanding," "Satisfactory," "Needs to Improve" or "Substantial Noncompliance." This assessment is reviewed for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also is assessed by the FRB in connection with any acquisition or merger application.
Automated Overdraft Payment Regulation
There are federal consumer protection laws related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. The CFPB prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service. Financial institutions must also provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution's overdraft services, including the associated fees and the consumer's choices. In addition, FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for "excessive or chronic" customer use and undertake "meaningful and effective" follow-up action with customers that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts and ensure board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs.
DOL Fiduciary Rule
During April 2016, the DOL issued a final rule related to fiduciary standards in regards to the investing of clients' retirement assets. The rule expands the definition of a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Those who provide investment advice to plans, plan sponsors, fiduciaries, plan participants, beneficiaries and IRAs and IRA owners must either avoid payments that create conflicts of interest or comply with the protective terms of an exemption issued by the DOL. Under new exemptions adopted with the rule, financial institutions would be obligated to acknowledge their status and the status of their individual advisers as "fiduciaries." Firms and advisers would be required to make prudent investment recommendations without regard to their own interests, or the interests of those other than the customer; charge only reasonable compensation; and make no misrepresentations to their customers regarding recommended investments. Additionally, the new rule would require certain disclosures to be made to the investor, and ongoing compliance must be monitored and documented. 
During 2017, the DOL issued extensions on implementation of certain aspects of the final rule to allow additional time to evaluate the impacts of the rule and extend the phase in period through July 1, 2019. In June 2018, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the rule. The DOL has stated that the agency is considering regulatory options in light of the Fifth Circuit opinion.
FDIC Recordkeeping Requirements
The FDIC has released a final rule to facilitate prompt payment of FDIC-insured deposits when large IDIs fail. The rule requires IDIs with two million or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor's ownership interest by right and capacity and to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner by ownership right and capacity. Compliance with the rule is required by April 1, 2020.
Cybersecurity
The CISA was enacted in 2018, and is focused on the protection of the nation's critical infrastructure from physical and cyber threats. The CISA is intended to improve cybersecurity in the U.S. by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the U.S. government and private sector entities, including financial institutions. The CISA also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law, and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from cyber attacks. The law includes liability protections for companies that share cyber threat information with third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with CISA.
Incentive-Based Compensation Arrangements
During May 2016, several financial regulators jointly issued a proposed rule designed to prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to a material financial loss. The proposed rule would require the applicable compensation arrangements to be considered against a number of factors, including a requirement that the arrangements contain both financial and non-financial measures of performance. In addition, the requirements would differ based on the size of the institution, and institutions with assets exceeding $50 billion would be subject to mandatory deferral, forfeiture/adjustment and clawback requirements for employees subject to the rule.
