     Item 1.    Business 
  Overview 
         FVCBankcorp, Inc. (the "Company") is a registered bank holding company headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. We operate primarily through our sole subsidiary, FVCbank, (the "Bank"), a community oriented, locally-owned and managed commercial bank organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. We serve the banking needs of commercial businesses, nonprofit organizations, professional service entities, and their respective owners and employees located in the greater Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metropolitan areas. The Company was established as the holding company for the Bank in 2015. 
         Since the Bank began operations in November 2007, on the cusp of the most significant economic downturn since the Great Depression, it has grown largely organically, through  de novo branch expansion and banker and customer acquisition, and two whole-bank acquisitions. In 2012, we completed the acquisition of 1st Commonwealth Bank of Virginia, a $58.9 million asset savings and loan association in Arlington, Virginia. 
         On October 12, 2018, we completed of our acquisition of Colombo Bank ("Colombo"), pursuant to a previously announced definitive merger agreement. Colombo, which was headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, merged into FVCbank effective October 12, 2018 adding five banking locations in Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County and the City of Baltimore in Maryland. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock during the five trading day period ended on October 10, 2018, the second trading day prior to closing, of $19.614 (the Average Closing Price") holders of shares of Colombo common stock received 0.002217 shares of the Company's common stock and $0.053157 in cash for each share of Colombo common stock held immediately prior to the effective date of the Merger, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares at a rate equal to the Average Closing Price, and subject to the right of holders of Colombo common stock who owned fewer than 45,086 shares of Colombo common stock after aggregation of all shares held in the same name, and who made a timely election, to receive only cash in an amount equal to $0.096649 per share of Colombo common stock. As a result of the merger, 763,051 shares of the Company's common stock were issued in exchange for outstanding shares of Colombo common stock. 
         Our acquisition of Colombo supports our current business and allowed us to expand our presence in adjacent markets where we lend, but in which we had no physical presence. Colombo's branch locations strengthen our strategy as they enable us to add lenders and banking services in areas where we currently lend. We expect that our strong infrastructure and wide range of products and services will allow us to develop deeper relationships with Colombo's current customers, as well as enhance our platform for generating new relationships. 
   Market Area 
         We operate in one of the most economically dynamic and wealthy regions of the Washington and Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Areas ("MSA"), focusing primarily on the Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the independent cities located within those counties, as well as Washington, D.C. its Maryland suburbs and Baltimore, Maryland and its surrounding suburbs. As of June 30, 2018, the Washington MSA had total deposits of $212.8 billion, based on FDIC data. The Baltimore MSA had total deposits of $72.5 billion as of June 30, 2018 based on FDIC data. 
         In addition to the presence of the federal government, the Washington MSA is defined by attractive market demographics, including strong household incomes, dense populations and the presence of a diverse group of large and small businesses. As of December 31, 2017, the 
 1

   Washington MSA had a median household income of $95,843, which ranks as fourth among all metropolitan statistical areas nationally, and a population of 6.2 million. The Virginia and Maryland localities within the Washington MSA in which we primarily operate have higher median household incomes than the Washington MSA as a whole. The significant presence of national and international businesses make the Washington MSA one of the most economically vibrant and diverse markets in the country. The Washington MSA is currently home to 15 Fortune 500 companies, including 9 based in Fairfax County. 
   Growth Strategy 
         Our approach features competitive customized financial services offered to customers and prospects in a personal relationship context by seasoned professionals. We provide a full range of banking services that become integral to our customers' business operations, which helps to enhance our ability to retain our relationships. We offer a better value proposition to our customers by providing high-touch service with few added fees. Our capabilities and reputation enable us to be selective in loan and customer selection, which contributes to our strong asset quality, and our ability to provide multiple services to customers. 
         We intend to continue expanding our market position through organic growth through expansion of our relationships with our existing customers, acquisition of new customers and acquisition of seasoned bankers with strong customer relationships, through selective branching, and potentially opportunistic acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Colombo, while increasing profitability, maintaining strong asset quality and a high level of customer service. 
         Our success has been driven by our mission to help our clients, communities and employees prosper. We strive to exceed our clients' expectations by delivering superior, personalized client service supported with high quality bank products and services. We invest in the growth of our employees and we give back to the communities in which we do business to foster a brighter future for everyone who lives there. Much of our early growth was the result of the active promotion by our organizing shareholders, our board of directors, our advisory board and our shareholders generally. Many of our shareholders are customers. We receive referrals from existing customers and all employees are encouraged to promote the Company. We believe having such a large group of individuals actively promote us has and will continue to augment our ability to generate both deposits and loans through staff and management led marketing and calling campaigns. As we have grown, we have increased our reliance on management originated customer relationships, but believe that our strong network of personal, customer and shareholder relationships and referrals will continue to be a significant factor in our business development strategy. 
         Our vision is to be known as the number one community bank in experience and service in our community. Our passion is to provide the utmost banking experience for each of our clients, to create a positive and empowering work environment for our employees, to fulfill our obligation of corporate citizenship in the communities in which we operate and to ensure that our Bank increases profitability and grows prudently, ensuring its strength and continuity, and increasing shareholder value. 
   Our Products and Services 
         We emphasize providing commercial banking services to small and medium-sized businesses, professionals, non-profit organizations and associations, and investors living and working in and near our service area. We offer retail banking services to accommodate the individual needs of both corporate customers as well as the communities we serve. We also offer online banking, mobile banking and a remote deposit service, which allows clients to facilitate and expedite deposit transactions through the use of electronic devices. A sophisticated suite of treasury management products is a key feature of our client focused, relationship driven marketing. We have partnered with experienced 
 2

   service providers in both insurance and merchant services to further augment the products available to our customers. 
   Lending Products 
         We provide a variety of lending products to small and medium-sized businesses, including (i) commercial real estate loans; (ii) commercial construction loans; (iii) commercial loans for a variety of business purposes such as for working capital, equipment purchases, lines of credit, and government contract financing; (iv) SBA lending; (v) asset based lending and accounts receivable financing; (vi) home equity loans, or HELOCs; and (vii) consumer loans for constructive purposes. Although we do not generally actively originate them, we have acquired pools of other types of loans, and we have purchased whole residential loans in our market area, student loans and other consumer loans, in order to diversify the loan portfolio, put capital to work before organic loan production requires it, and to increase margin. We may also purchase participations from other banks in our market. Any acquired loans must meet our standard underwriting requirements. 
  Commercial Real Estate Loans.    Commercial real estate loans, which comprise the largest portion of the loan portfolio, are secured by both owner occupied and investor owned commercial properties, including multi-family residential real estate. Commercial real estate loans are structured using both variable and fixed rates and renegotiable rates which adjust in three to five years, with maturities of generally five to ten years. At December 31, 2018, owner occupied commercial real estate loans represented 13.8% of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2018, non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans represented approximately 33.6% of the loan portfolio and multi-family residential real estate comprised 6.2% of the portfolio. We seek to mitigate lending risks typical of this type of loan such as declines in real estate values, changes in borrower cash flow and general economic conditions. We typically require a maximum loan to value of 80% and minimum cash flow and debt service coverages, of at least 1.20 to 1.0. Personal guarantees are generally required, but may be limited. We generally require that interest rates adjust not less frequently than five years. For purposes of geographic diversification, we will also make commercial real estate loans outside of our primary and secondary markets, in an area extending south to Richmond, Virginia, and north to Baltimore, Maryland, and between Winchester, Virginia and the Eastern Shore of Maryland. 
         Construction Loans.    Commercial construction loans for the acquisition, development and construction of commercial real estate also comprise a significant and growing portion of the portfolio. At December 31, 2018, such loans represented 13.5% of the loan portfolio. Our typical commercial construction loan involves property that will ultimately be leased to a non-owner occupant. We will finance construction projects of a speculative nature, which are well-conceived and structured with appropriate interest reserves and analyzed fully. In underwriting commercial construction loans, we consider the expected costs of the transaction, the loan to value ratio, the credit history, cash flows and liquidity of the borrower, the project and the guarantors, the debt service coverage ratios (which are stressed prior to approval), take out sources for the permanent loan or repayment of the construction loan, the reputation, experience and qualifications of the borrower, the general contractor and others involved with the project and other factors. Commercial construction loans are generally made on a variable rate basis, typically based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and subject to rate floors, for terms of 12 - 24 months. Generally, we do not make commercial construction loans outside of our primary or secondary market areas. 
  Commercial Loans, Government Contracting.    Commercial loans for a variety of business purposes, including working capital, equipment purchases, lines of credit, and government contract financing and asset based lending and accounts receivable financing, comprise approximately 12.1% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. We will make commercial loans on a secured or unsecured basis. We will generally require the owners, managing members, general partners and principals of the borrowing entity or that control more than 20% of the borrower to guaranty the loan, unless a combination of low 
 3

   leverage, significant income and debt service coverage ratios, and substantial experience in operating the business, strong management and internal controls and/or other factors are demonstrated. Commercial loans are typically made with variable or adjustable rates. The cash flow of the borrower/borrower's operating business is often the principal source of debt service, with a secondary emphasis on other collateral. 
         We have developed a special expertise in government contract financing. We will lend to government contractors or subcontractors headquartered in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. This area of lending encompasses lines of credit for working capital, financing of government leases, and, less frequently term, loans, to operating companies that recognize over 50% of their total revenues from services provided to federal government agencies or rated state and municipal governments. Our borrowers are typically engaged in technology or service businesses, but may also include construction and equipment providers, or entities working on "black" projects. A government contractor borrower must have an acceptable level of eligible accounts receivable, provide appropriate security instruments perfecting our rights in the accounts receivable or other collateral, and are subject to periodic review and monitoring of their receivables, contract backlog and contract compliance. The contractor is typically required to have its primary deposit relationship with us. Advance rates will be up to 90% of prime eligible government receivables, and lower percentages depending on the nature of the receivables. At December 31, 2018, outstanding loans to government contractors represented 33.0% of our commercial and industrial segment. Total commitments to government contractors totaled $127.3 million at December 31, 2018. Government contact loans are typically made with variable or adjustable rates. Lines of credit typically have a one year term. As with other commercial loans, guarantees are typically required. 
  Consumer Residential.    We actively originate HELOCs in the communities we serve in the Washington and Baltimore MSAs. Our HELOCs generally have a maximum loan to value of up to 85%, however, due to the favorable economic conditions and strong residential real estate market in these markets, actual loan to values are typically lower than the maximum. We provide HELOCs as a service to our customers and when we receive referrals from various mortgage brokers within our market area. As of December 31, 2018, HELOCs comprise 7.0% of total loans. While we do not originate residential first mortgages, we will occasionally originate a mortgage loan meeting our investment preferences presented by a mortgage broker. We have also purchased portfolios of 1-4 family residential first mortgage loans on properties located in our market area for yield and diversification. At December 31, 2018, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans represented 4.5% of the loan portfolio. 
  Other Loans.    We occasionally originate consumer loans both on an unsecured basis and secured by non-real estate collateral. We have also purchased pools of unsecured consumer loans and student loans from a third party for yield and diversification. 
         The lending activities in which we engage carry the risk that the borrowers will be unable to perform on their obligations. As such, interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve and general economic conditions, nationally and in our market areas, could have a significant impact on our results of operations. To the extent that economic conditions deteriorate, business and individual borrowers may be less able to meet their obligations to us in full, in a timely manner, resulting in decreased earnings or losses. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the value and liquidity of property pledged as security for loans. 
         Our goal is to mitigate risks in the event of unforeseen threats to the loan portfolio as a result of economic downturn or other negative influences. Plans for mitigating inherent risks in managing loan assets include: carefully enforcing loan policies and procedures, evaluating each borrower's business plan during the underwriting process and throughout the loan term, identifying and monitoring primary and alternative sources for loan repayment, and obtaining collateral to mitigate economic loss in the 
 4

   event of liquidation. Specific loan reserves are established based upon credit and/or collateral risks on an individual loan basis. A risk rating system is employed to proactively estimate loss exposure and provide a measuring system for setting general and specific reserve allocations. 
         Our lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by state and federal law. These limits will increase or decrease in response to increases or decreases in our level of capital. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had a legal lending limit of $25.9 million. At December 31, 2018, our average funded loan size outstanding for commercial real estate (including commercial construction) and commercial loans was $1.5 million and $639 thousand, respectively. In accordance with internal lending policies, we may sell participations in its loans to other banks, which allows us to manage risk involved in these loans and to meet the lending needs of our clients. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk.    Most of our lending is conducted with businesses and individuals in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. Our loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate loans, including construction and land loans, which totaled $836.9 million and constituted 73.5% of total loans as of December 31, 2018, and commercial loans, including loans to government contractors, which totaled $137.3 million and constituted 12.1% of total loans as of December 31, 2018. The geographic concentration of our loans subjects our business to the general economic conditions within our market area. The risks created by such concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. 
         Comprehensive risk management practices and appropriate capital levels are essential elements of a sound commercial real estate lending program. A concentration in commercial real estate adds a dimension of risk that compounds the risk inherent in individual loans. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that institutions that have (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (ii) total reported commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months, are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. We have a concentration in commercial real estate loans, and we have experienced significant growth in our commercial real estate portfolio in recent years. As of December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans as defined for regulatory purposes represented 353.0% of our total risk-based capital. Of those loans, commercial construction, development and land loans represented 88.6% of our total risk based capital. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans represented an additional 91.0% of our total risk based capital. Management has extensive experience in commercial real estate lending, and has implemented and continues to maintain heightened portfolio monitoring and reporting, and strong underwriting criteria with respect to our commercial real estate portfolio. 
   Deposit Products 
         We offer a wide array of deposit products for individuals, professionals, government contractors and other businesses, including interest and noninterest-bearing transaction accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts. We are a relationship based bank, and maintenance of significant deposit relationships is a factor in our decision to make loans and the pricing of our products. 
         Our sophisticated treasury management and online banking platform allows a commercial customer to view balances, initiate payments, pay bills (including positive pay), issue stop payments, reconcile accounts and set up custom alerts. Online wires, ACH (including positive authorization), remote 
 5

   capture, cash disbursement and cash concentration are additional payment options available to businesses. We provide customers with a sophisticated escrow management product which facilitates and simplifies management of multiple escrow balances. We also provide secure credit card processing and merchant services, with reporting tailored to customer needs. We also offer online and mobile banking products to our consumer depositors, to complement our branch network. 
   Other Services 
         Through third party networks, we offer our customers access to a full range of business insurance products and business and consumer credit card products. 
   Competition 
         We are one of the few remaining locally owned and managed independent community banks headquartered in Northern Virginia. We believe that this is an advantageous position and valuable quality which positively differentiates us from our competitors and positions us for future growth from individuals and small and mid-sized business customers who value the attention and customized services which a locally owned and managed community bank can provide. 
         As of June 30, 2018, there were approximately $212.8 billion dollars in total deposits shared between banking institutions located in Washington MSA, according to SNL Financial, and our deposit market share is approximately 0.55%. Our strategic goal is to increase our market share through selective new branch additions, opportunistic acquisitions, and acquisitions of customers from larger competitors. BB&T Corporation, PNC Financial Services Group Inc., M&T Bank Corporation and Bank of America Corporation hold the primary market shares. However, we believe these large banks generally cannot provide the same level of attention and customization of services to small businesses that we seek to provide. Through correspondents, referrals to third parties with whom we have partnered, and our own capabilities, we are a full service financial provider, able to compete in substantially all areas of banking, except trust services. Additionally, we believe we provide competitively priced products, superior customer service, flexibility and responsiveness when compared to our larger competitors. 
         The banking business is highly competitive. We compete as a financial intermediary with other commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions operating in the Washington and Baltimore MSAs and elsewhere. 
         Our market area is a highly competitive, highly branched, banking market. Competition in our market area for loans to small and middle-market businesses and professionals, our target market, is intense and pricing is important. Several of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services that we do not currently provide or currently expect to provide in the near future. Moreover, larger institutions operating in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan market have access to borrowed funds at lower cost than may be available to us. Additionally, deposit competition among institutions in the market area is strong. As a result, it is possible that we may pay above market rates to attract deposits. 
   Risk Management 
         We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance. Risk management refers to the activities by which we identify, measure, monitor, evaluate and manage the risks we face in the course of our banking activities. These include liquidity, interest rate, credit, operational, compliance, regulatory, strategic, financial and reputational risk exposures. Our board of directors and management team have created a risk-conscious culture that is focused on quality growth, which starts with capable 
 6

   and experienced risk management teams and infrastructure capable of addressing the evolving risks we face, as well as the changing regulatory and compliance landscape. Our risk management approach employs comprehensive policies and processes to establish robust governance. We believe a disciplined and conservative underwriting approach has been the key to our strong asset quality. 
         Our board of directors sets the tone at the top of our organization, adopting and overseeing the implementation of our risk management, establishing our overall risk appetite and risk management strategy. The board of directors approves our various operating policies, which include risk policies, procedures, limits, targets and reporting structured to guide decisions regarding the appropriate balance between risk and return considerations in our business. Our board of directors receives periodic reporting on the risks and control environment effectiveness and monitors risk levels in relation to the approved risk appetite. The Audit Committee of our board of directors provides primary oversight of our enterprise risk management function. 
         Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms and the risk that credit assets will suffer significant deterioration in market value. We manage and control credit risk in our loan portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management, and approved by the board of directors. Our written loan policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, product and geographic levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with policies, risk rating standards and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We evaluate our customers' borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history. Our management and board of directors place significant focus on maintaining a healthy risk profile and ensuring sustainable growth. Our risk appetite seeks to balance the risks necessary to achieve our strategic goals while ensuring that our risks are appropriately managed and remain within our defined limits. 
         Our management of interest rate and liquidity risk is overseen by our Asset and Liability Committee, based on a risk management infrastructure approved by our board of directors that outlines reporting and measurement requirements. In particular, this infrastructure reviews financial performance, trends, and significant variances to budget; reviews and recommends for board approval risk limits and tolerances; reviews ongoing monitoring and reporting regarding our performance with respect to these areas of risk, including compliance with board-approved risk limits and stress-testing; ensures annual back-testing and independent validation of models at a frequency commensurate with risk level; reviews all hedging strategies and recommends changes as appropriate; reviews and recommends our contingency funding plan; establishes wholesale borrowing limits to be submitted to the board of directors or its designated committee; and acts as a second line of defense in reviewing information and reports submitted to the council for the purpose of identifying, investigating, and assuring remediation, to its satisfaction, of errors or irregularities, if any. 
   Investment Portfolio 
         Our investment securities portfolio is primarily maintained as an on-balance sheet contingent source of liquidity to fund loans and meet the demands of depositors. It provides additional interest income and we seek to have limited interest rate risk and credit risk. We currently classify substantially all of our investment securities as available-for-sale. Our investment policy authorizes investment primarily in securities of the U.S. government and its agencies; mortgage back securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued and fully backed by U.S. government agencies, securities of municipalities and to a lesser extent corporate bonds and other obligations, in each case meeting identified credit standards, and certificates of deposit. The securities portfolio, along with certain loans, 
 7

   may also be used to collateralize public deposits, FHLB borrowings, and Federal Reserve Bank borrowings. We manage our investment portfolio according to written investment policies approved by our board of directors. Our investment strategy aims to maximize earnings while maintaining liquidity in securities with minimal credit risk and interest rate risk which is reflective in the yields obtained on those securities. 
   Employees 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had 128 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements. 
      SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
        Our business and operations are subject to extensive federal and state governmental regulation and supervision. The following is a brief summary of certain statutes and rules and regulations that affect or will affect us. This summary is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes or regulations applicable to our business. Supervision, regulation, and examination by the regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, rather than our shareholders. 
         The Company.    We are a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, or the Act, and subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or Federal Reserve. The Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe and unsound banking practices. As a bank holding company, we are required to file with the Federal Reserve an annual report and such other additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve may also examine us and our subsidiary. We are subject to risk-based capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve, which are substantially identical to those applicable to the Bank, and which are described below. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve is required to apply consolidated capital requirements to depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally requires capital requirements to be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. 
         The Federal Reserve has adopted a policy statement, the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement, or the policy statement, that exempts certain bank holding companies with assets of less than $3 billion, from the consolidated capital requirements and certain other provisions where the bank holding company (i) is not engaged in significant nonbanking activities; (ii) does not conduct significant off balance sheet activities; and (iii) does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. We understand that the Federal Reserve has not historically deemed a bank holding company ineligible for application of the policy statement solely because its common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will continue this practice. 
         The Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve for, among other things, a bank holding company's direct or indirect acquisition of control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all the assets, of any bank or the merger or consolidation by a bank holding company with another bank holding company. The Act generally permits the acquisition by a bank holding company of control or substantially all the assets of any bank located in a state other than the home state of the bank holding company, except where the bank has not been in existence for the minimum period of 
 8

   time required by state law; but if the bank is at least five years old, the Federal Reserve may approve the acquisition. 
         With limited exceptions, a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring control of any voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in any activity other than banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing service for its authorized subsidiaries. A bank holding company may, however, engage in or acquire an interest in, a company that engages in activities which the Federal Reserve has determined by order or regulation to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be properly incident thereto. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve is required to consider whether the performance of such activities can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as convenience, increased competition or gains in efficiency, which outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices. The Federal Reserve is also empowered to differentiate between activities commenced de novo and activities commenced by the acquisition, in whole or in part, of a going concern. Some of the activities that the Federal Reserve has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking include making or servicing loans, performing certain data processing services, acting as a fiduciary or investment or financial advisor, and making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare. 
         The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company's continued ownership, activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness, or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries. 
         Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, on any extensions of credit to a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, or investments in the stock or other securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Further, a bank holding company and any subsidiary bank are prohibited from engaging in tie-in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit. A subsidiary bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or services from or to such bank other than a loan, discount, deposit or trust service; (ii) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property or service from or to the holding company or any of its subsidiaries; or (iii) the customer not obtain some other credit, property or service from competitors, except for reasonable requirements to assure the soundness of credit extended. 
         The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLB Act allows a bank holding company or other company to elect to become a financial holding company, which would allow such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker, underwriting, dealing in or making markets in securities, and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. We have not elected financial holding company status. 
         The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or FDIA, and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its bank subsidiaries. In addition, where a bank holding company has more than one FDIC-insured bank or thrift subsidiary, each of the bank holding company's subsidiary FDIC-insured depository institutions is responsible for any losses to the FDIC as a result of an affiliated depository institution's failure. As a result of a bank holding company's source of strength obligation, a bank holding company may be required to provide funds to a bank subsidiary in the form of subordinate capital or other instruments which qualify as capital under 
 9

   bank regulatory rules. Any loans from the holding company to such subsidiary banks likely would be unsecured and subordinated to such bank's depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the Bank. 
         A bank holding company (other than a bank holding company subject to the policy statement) is generally required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its own then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has adopted an exception to this approval requirement for well capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain conditions. 
         As a Virginia corporation, we are subject to limitations and restrictions on our activities. For example, state law restrictions in Virginia include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records, minutes, borrowing and the observance of corporate formalities. 
  The Bank.    The Bank is a Virginia chartered commercial bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, or a state member bank, whose accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to the maximum legal limits. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, or VBFI, and the Federal Reserve. The regulations of these various agencies govern most aspects of the Bank's business, including required reserves against deposits, loans, investments, mergers and acquisitions, borrowing, dividends and establishment of branch offices. 
         The laws and regulations governing the Bank generally have been promulgated to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. 
         Competition among commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions has increased following enactment of legislation, which greatly expanded the ability of banks and bank holding companies to engage in interstate banking or acquisition activities. 
         Banking is a business, which depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the differences between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest received by a bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its investment portfolio constitute the major portion of the Bank's earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of the Bank will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money through various means including open market dealings in United States government securities. The nature and timing of changes in such policies and their impact on the Bank cannot be predicted. 
         Branching and Interstate Banking.    The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the Banks has opted out of the interstate bank merger provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, or the Riegle-Neal Act, by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act and prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks, expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches are permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations 
 10

   described in the Riegle-Neal Act. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes national and state banks to establish de novo branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. 
         Virginia Law.    Virginia law governs the licensing and regulation of Virginia chartered banks like the Bank, including organizational and capital requirements, fiduciary powers, investment authority, banking offices and electronic terminals, declaration of dividends, changes of control and mergers, out of state activities, interstate branching and banking, borrowing limits, limits on loans to one borrower and liquidation, among other matters. The VBFI is charged with our supervision and regulation. The VBFI may take possession of a bank if certain conditions exist such as insufficient shareholders' equity, unsafe or unauthorized operations, or violations of law. 
         Under Virginia law, we may engage in the general business of banking, including but not limited to, accepting deposits, making secured and unsecured loans, purchasing and holding real property for our own use, and issuing, advising and confirming letters of credit. With limited exceptions, loans to one person may not exceed 15% of the sum of a bank's shareholders' equity, allowance for loan losses and capital notes and debentures. 
  USA Patriot Act.    Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or USA Patriot Act or Patriot Act, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, as well as enhanced due diligence standards intended to detect, and prevent, the use of the United States financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Patriot Act requires financial institutions, including banks, to establish anti-money laundering programs, including employee training and independent audit requirements, meet minimum standards specified by the act, follow minimum standards for customer identification and maintenance of customer identification records, and regularly compare customer lists against lists of suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations and money launderers. The costs or other effects of the compliance burdens imposed by the Patriot Act or future anti-terrorist, homeland security or anti-money laundering legislation or regulation cannot be predicted with certainty. 
         Bank Secrecy Act.    The Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies, procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The program must, at a minimum: (i) provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance; (iii) designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel. In addition, banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury Department. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The regulations implementing the BSA explicitly include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, to include understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile. In addition, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers (other than those that are excluded) at the time a new account is opened (other than accounts that are exempted).

 Office of Foreign Assets Control.    The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, foreign nationals and others, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's OFAC. The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on a "U.S. person" engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of a sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g. property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 
  Capital Adequacy.    The Federal Reserve adopted risk-based and leverage capital adequacy requirements, pursuant to which they assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising banks and bank holding companies and in analyzing bank regulatory applications. Risk-based capital requirements determine the adequacy of capital based on the risk inherent in various classes of assets and off-balance sheet items. The Dodd-Frank Act additionally requires capital requirements to be countercyclical so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, consistent with safety and soundness. 
         The federal banking agencies have adopted rules, referred to as the "Basel III Rules," to implement the framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III. The Basel III framework, among other things, (i) introduced CET1, (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and "Additional Tier 1 capital" instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) defined CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expanded the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations. 
         When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, Basel III requires banks to maintain: (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5%, or 7.0%; (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer, or 8.5%; (iii) a minimum ratio of Total (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0% plus the capital conservation buffer, or 10.5%; and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). 
         Basel III also provides for a "countercyclical capital buffer," generally to be imposed when federal banking agencies determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. 
         Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) may face constraints on its ability to pay dividends, effect equity repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers, which constraints vary based on the amount of the shortfall. 
         Under the Basel III Rules, mortgage-servicing assets and deferred tax assets are subject to stricter limitations than those previously applicable under capital rules. More specifically, certain deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, mortgage-servicing assets, and significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock are each subject to an individual limit of 10% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements and are subject to an aggregate limit 
 12

   of 15% of common equity Tier 1 capital elements. The amount of these items in excess of the 10% and 15% thresholds are to be deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital. Amounts of mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets, and significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions that are not deducted due to the aforementioned 10% and 15% thresholds must be assigned a 250% risk weight. Finally, the rule increases the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors. A recent rule proposal would revise the treatment of deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights to increase the amounts of such assets includable in capital. 
         The Basel III Rules also include, as part of the definition of CET1 capital, a requirement that banking institutions include the amount of additional other comprehensive income, or AOCI, which primarily consists of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, which are not required to be treated as other-than-temporary impairment, net of tax in calculating regulatory capital, unless the institution makes a one-time opt-out election from this provision in connection with the filing of its first regulatory reports after applicability of the Basel III Rules to that institution. The Company opted-out of this requirement and, as such, does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital calculation. The Basel III Rules also require a 4% minimum leverage ratio, and a 5% leverage ratio to be considered well capitalized. 
         The Basel III Rules also make changes to the manner of calculating risk weighted assets. New methodologies for determining risk weighted assets in the general capital rules are included, including revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation, including a greater recognition of financial collateral and a wider range of eligible guarantors. They also include risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; and higher (greater than 100%) risk weighting for certain commercial real estate exposures that have higher credit risk profiles, including higher loan to value and equity components. In particular, loans categorized as "high-volatility commercial real estate," or HVCRE, loans are required to be assigned a 150% risk weighting, and require additional capital support. HVCRE loans are defined to include any credit facility that finances or has financed the acquisition, development or construction of real property, unless it finances: 1-4 family residential properties; certain community development investments; agricultural land used or usable for, and whose value is based on, agricultural use; or commercial real estate projects in which: (i) the loan-to-value ratio is less than the applicable maximum supervisory loan-to-value ratio established by the bank regulatory agencies; (ii) the borrower has contributed cash or unencumbered readily marketable assets, or has paid development expenses out of pocket, equal to at least 15% of the appraised "as completed" value; (iii) the borrower contributes its 15% before the bank advances any funds; and (iv) the capital contributed by the borrower, and any funds internally generated by the project, is contractually required to remain in the project until the facility is converted to permanent financing, sold or paid in full. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, or the 2018 Act, expanded the exclusion from HVCRE loans to include credit facilities financing the acquisition or refinance of, or improvements to, existing income producing property, secured by the property, if the cash flow being generated by the property is sufficient to support the debt service and expenses of the property in accordance with the institution's loan criteria for permanent financing. The 2018 Act also provides that the value of contributed property will be its appraised value, rather than its cost. The 2018 Act permits an institution to reclassify an HVCRE loan as a non-HVCRE loan upon substantial completion of the project, where the cash flow from the property is sufficient to support debt service and expenses, in accordance with the institution's underwriting criteria for permanent financing. 
         The Basel III Rules became applicable to the Bank on January 1, 2015. As the Company is subject to the policy statement, the consolidated capital requirements do not apply to it. The capital conservation buffer requirement is fully implemented at 2.5%. The Company and Bank elected to exclude AOCI in calculating regulatory capital as permitted under the Basel III Rule. 
 13

           The capital ratios described above are the minimum levels that the federal banking agencies expect. Our state and federal regulators have the discretion to require us to maintain higher capital levels based upon our concentrations of loans, the risk of our lending or other activities, the performance of our loan and investment portfolios and other factors. Failure to maintain such higher capital expectations could result in a lower composite regulatory rating, which would impact our deposit insurance premiums and could affect our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing, and could result in additional or more severe enforcement actions. In respect of institutions with high concentrations of loans in areas deemed to be higher risk, or during periods of significant economic stress, regulators may require an institution to maintain a higher level of capital, and/or to maintain more stringent risk management measures, than those required by these regulations. 
         In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published the last version of the Basel III accord, generally referred to as "Basel IV." The Basel Committee stated that a key objective of the revisions incorporated into the framework is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets, or RWA, which will be accomplished by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk and operational risk, which will facilitate the comparability of banks' capital ratios; constraining the use of internally modeled approaches; and complementing the risk-weighted capital ratio with a finalized leverage ratio and a revised and robust capital floor. Leadership of the federal banking agencies who are tasked with implementing Basel IV supported the revisions. Although it is uncertain at this time, we anticipate some, if not all, of the Basel IV accord may be incorporated into the capital requirements framework applicable to us. 
         The 2018 Act also directs the federal bank regulatory agencies to develop a "Community Bank Leverage Ratio," calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average consolidated total assets, of not less than 8% and not more than 10%. If a "qualified community bank," generally a depository institution or depository institution holding company with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, has a leverage ratio which exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, then such bank will be considered to have met all generally applicable leverage and risk based capital requirements; the capital ratio requirements for "well capitalized" status under Section 38 of the FDIA, and any other leverage or capital requirements to which it is subject. A bank or holding company may be excluded from qualifying community bank status base on its risk profile, including consideration of its off-balance sheet exposures; trading assets and liabilities; total notional derivatives exposures and such other facts as the appropriate federal banking agencies determine to be appropriate. The federal banking agencies have proposed a Community Bank Leverage Ratio of 9%. Even if the Bank qualifies to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio, there can be no assurance that the compliance with that ratio will provide the Bank with an adequate level of capital to avoid adverse impacts in the event of economic stress, adverse asset quality, or if it incurs losses. 
  Prompt Corrective Action.    Under Section 38 of the FDIA, each federal banking agency is required to implement a system of prompt corrective action for institutions that it regulates. The federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement the system of prompt corrective action established by Section 38 of the FDIA. Since January 1, 2015, the following capital requirements applied to the Company for purposes of Section 38. 

   
Capital Category | Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio | Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio | Leverage Ratio | Tangible Equity to Assets | Supplemental Leverage Ratio
Well Capitalized | 10% or greater | 8% or greater | 6.5% or greater | 5% or greater | n/a | n/a 
Adequately Capitalized | 8% or greater | 6% or greater | 4.5% or greater | 4% or greater | n/a | 3% or greater 
Undercapitalized | Less than 8% | Less than 6% | Less than 4.5% | Less than 4% | n/a | Less than 3% 
Significantly Undercapitalized | Less than 6% | Less than 4% | Less than 3% | Less than 3% | n/a | n/a 
Critically Undercapitalized | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | Less than 2% | n/a

           An institution generally must file a written capital restoration plan which meets specified requirements with an appropriate federal banking agency within 45 days of the date the institution receives notice or is deemed to have notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. A federal banking agency must provide the institution with written notice of approval or disapproval within 60 days after receiving a capital restoration plan, subject to extensions by the applicable agency. 
         An institution which is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guaranty by each company that controls the institution. Such guaranty shall be limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the institution's total assets at the time the institution was notified or deemed to have notice that it was undercapitalized or (ii) the amount necessary at such time to restore the relevant capital measures of the institution to the levels required for the institution to be classified as adequately capitalized. Such a guaranty shall expire after the federal banking agency notifies the institution that it has remained adequately capitalized for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. An institution which fails to submit a written capital restoration plan within the requisite period, including any required performance guaranty, or fails in any material respect to implement a capital restoration plan, shall be subject to the restrictions in Section 38 of the FDIA which are applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. 
         A "critically undercapitalized institution" is to be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days unless the FDIC or other appropriate federal banking agency formally determines that forbearance from such action would better protect the Deposit Insurance Fund. Unless the FDIC or other appropriate federal banking agency makes specific further findings and certifies that the institution is viable and is not expected to fail, an institution that remains critically undercapitalized on average during the fourth calendar quarter after the date it becomes critically undercapitalized must be placed in receivership. The general rule is that the FDIC will be appointed as receiver within 90 days after a bank becomes critically undercapitalized unless extremely good cause is shown and an extension is agreed to by the federal regulators. In general, good cause is defined as capital, which has been raised and is imminently available for infusion into the Bank except for certain technical requirements, which may delay the infusion for a period of time beyond the 90 day time period. 
         Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, an institution shall become subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institution's assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. 
         Additionally, under Section 11(c)(5) of the FDIA, a conservator or receiver may be appointed for an institution where: (i) an institution's obligations exceed its assets; (ii) there is substantial dissipation of the institution's assets or earnings as a result of any violation of law or any unsafe or unsound practice; (iii) the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition; (iv) there is a willful violation of a cease-and-desist order; (v) the institution is unable to pay its obligations in the ordinary course of business; (vi) losses or threatened losses deplete all or substantially all of an institution's capital, and there is no reasonable prospect of becoming "adequately capitalized" without assistance; (vii) there is 
 15

   any violation of law or unsafe or unsound practice or condition that is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings, weaken the institution's condition, or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of depositors or the insurance fund; (viii) an institution ceases to be insured; (ix) the institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect that it will become adequately capitalized, fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so, or fails to submit or materially implement a capital restoration plan; or (x) the institution is critically undercapitalized or otherwise has substantially insufficient capital. 
  Regulatory Enforcement Authority.    Federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking agencies. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. In addition, the FDIC could terminate the institution's deposit insurance if it determines that the institution's financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that violated an applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution's regulators. 
         As a result of the volatility and instability in the financial system in recent years, Congress, the bank regulatory authorities and other government agencies have called for or proposed additional regulation and restrictions on the activities, practices and operations of banks and their holding companies. Congress and the federal banking agencies have broad authority to require all banks and holding companies to adhere to more rigorous or costly operating procedures, corporate governance procedures, or to engage in activities or practices which they would not otherwise elect. Any such requirement could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
  The Dodd-Frank Act.    The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the current bank regulatory structure, which affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a number of federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare various studies and reports for Congress. Although it is not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this statute until the extensive rulemaking is complete and becomes effective, the following provisions are considered to be of greatest significance to us:
 

 Expands the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including insured depository
institutions. 
 Requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive approval of an interstate bank acquisition. 
 Provides mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer's ability to pay and making more loans subject to provisions for higher-cost loans and
new disclosures. 
 Creates the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, which has rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that
apply to all banks, and has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. 
 Creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council with authority to identify institutions and practices that might pose a systemic risk. 
 Introduces additional corporate governance and executive compensation requirements on companies subject to the Exchange Act, as amended. 
 Permits FDIC-insured banks to pay interest on business demand deposits. 

 16

   

 Codifies the requirement that holding companies and other companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution to
serve as a source of financial strength. 
 Makes permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance. 
 Permits national and state banks to establish interstate branches to the same extent as the branch host state allows establishment of in-state
branches. 

         The 2018 Act includes provisions revising Dodd-Frank Act provisions, including provisions that, among other things: (i) exempt banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans; (ii) exempt certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas from appraisal requirements; (iii) exempt banks and credit unions that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from the expanded data disclosures required under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, or HMDA (the provision would not apply to nonbanks and would not exempt institutions from HMDA reporting altogether); (iv) amend the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act by providing registered mortgage loan originators in good standing with 120 days of transitional authority to originate loans when moving from a federal depository institution to a non-depository institution or across state lines; (v) require the CFPB to clarify how TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure applies to mortgage assumption transactions and construction-to-permanent home loans as well as outline certain liabilities related to model disclosure use; (vi) revise treatment of HVCRE exposures; and (vii) create the simplified Community Bank Leverage Capital Ratio. The 2018 Act also exempts community banks from Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act, commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, if they have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets; and exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets, and total trading assets and liabilities not exceeding more than five percent of their total assets from the Volcker Rule restrictions on trading with their own capital. The 2018 Act also adds certain protections for consumers, including veterans and active duty military personnel, expanded credit freezes and creation of an identity theft protection database. 
         In addition, other new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the bank and non-bank financial services industries and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.    The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new, independent federal agency within the Federal Reserve having broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the consumer financial privacy provisions of the GLB Act and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions, including the Bank, are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking agencies for compliance with federal consumer protection laws and regulations. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. The Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer 
 17

   protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. 
         The CFPB has proposed or issued a number of important rules affecting a wide range of consumer financial products. These rules may impact the profitability of our business activities, limit our ability to make, or the desirability of making, certain types of loans, including non-qualified mortgage loans, require us to change our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business or profitability. The changes may also require us to dedicate significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to comply with the new statutory and regulatory requirements. 
         The CFPB has concentrated much of its rulemaking efforts on reforms related to residential mortgage transactions. The CFPB has issued rules related to a borrower's ability to repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, requirements for high-cost mortgages, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. The CFPB has also issued rules establishing integrated disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closed end, real estate secured consumer loans. The Bank fully complies with these rules and expanding the scope of information lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housing-related loan applications under HMDA. These rules, which become effective on a rolling basis through January 1, 2019, include significant regulatory and compliance changes and are expected to have a broad impact on the financial services industry. 
         The rule implementing the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that lenders determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan, established certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations, and established certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of "qualified mortgages." Generally, the rule applies to all consumer-purpose, closed-end loans secured by a dwelling including home-purchase loans, refinances and home equity loanswhether first or subordinate lien. The rule does not cover, among other things, home equity lines of credit or other open-end credit; temporary or "bridge" loans with a term of 12 months or less, such as a loan to finance the initial construction of a dwelling; a construction phase of 12 months or less of a construction-to-permanent loan; and business-purpose loans, even if secured by a dwelling. The rule afforded greater legal protections for lenders making qualified mortgages that are not "higher priced." Qualified mortgages must generally satisfy detailed requirements related to product features, underwriting standards, and a points and fees requirement whereby the total points and fees on a mortgage loan cannot exceed specified amounts or percentages of the total loan amount. Mandatory features of a qualified mortgage include: (i) a loan term not exceeding 30 years; and (ii) regular periodic payments that do not result in negative amortization, deferral of principal repayment, or a balloon payment. Further, the rule clarified that qualified mortgages do not include "no-doc" loans and loans with negative amortization, interest-only payments, or balloon payments. The rule created special categories of qualified mortgages originated by certain smaller creditors. To the extent that we seek to make qualified mortgages, we are required to comply with these rules, subject to available exclusions. Our business strategy, product offerings, and profitability may change as the rule is interpreted by the regulators and courts. 
         Financial Privacy.    Under the Federal Right to Privacy Act of 1978, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records, financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information. Consumers generally may prevent financial institutions from sharing personal financial information with nonaffiliated third parties except for third parties that market the institutions' own products and services. Additionally, financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers.

    Community Reinvestment Act.    The Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their respective jurisdictions, the federal banking agencies will evaluate the record of each financial institution in meeting the needs of its local community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Our Bank's record of performance under the CRA is publicly available. A bank's CRA performance is also considered in evaluating applications seeking approval for mergers, acquisitions, and new offices or facilities. Failure to adequately meet these criteria could result in additional requirements and limitations being imposed on the Bank. Additionally, we must publicly disclose the terms of certain CRA-related agreements. 
  Fair and Responsible Banking.    Banks and other financial institutions are subject to numerous laws and regulations intended to promote fair and responsible banking and prohibit unlawful discrimination and unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in banking. These laws include, among others, the Dodd-Frank Act, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Housing Act. 
         Many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous, and in addition, to those listed above. These federal, state and local laws regulate the manner in which financial institutions deal with customers taking deposits, making loans or conducting other types of transactions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could give rise to regulatory sanctions, and actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. 
         FDIC Insurance Premiums.    FDIC-insured banks, such as the Bank, are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC. For banks with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the assessment rate is calculated using a financial ratios method based on a statistical model estimating the bank's probability of failure over three years utilizing seven financial ratios (leverage ratio; net income before taxes/total assets; nonperforming loans and leases/gross assets; other real estate owned/gross assets; brokered deposit ratio; one year asset growth; and loan mix index) and a weighted average of supervisory ratings components. The final rule also eliminates the brokered deposit downward adjustment factor for such banks' assessment rates, providing a new brokered deposit ratio applicable to all small banks, whereby brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total consolidated assets (inclusive of reciprocal deposits if a bank is not well capitalized or has a composite supervisory rating other than a 1 or 2) as a result of which assessment rates may be increased for banks which experience rapid growth; lowers the range of assessment rates authorized to 1.5 basis points for an institution posing the least risk, to 40 basis points for an institution posing the most risk; and will further lower the range of assessment rates if the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increases to 2% or more. Banks with over $10 billion in total consolidated assets are required to pay a surcharge of 4.5 basis points on their assessment basis, subject to certain adjustments. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, FDIC insured institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion will be subject to a phase out of the deductibility of deposit insurance premiums. The FDIC may also impose special assessments from time to time. 
         The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250 thousand per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on a financial institution's average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits by 2020 and eliminates the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. 
  Concentration and Risk Guidance.    The federal banking regulatory agencies issued joint interagency guidance regarding material direct and indirect asset and funding concentrations. The guidance defines a concentration as any of the following: (i) asset concentrations of 25% or more of total capital (loan related) or Tier 1 capital (non-loan related) by individual borrower, small 
 19

   interrelated group of individuals, single repayment source or individual project; (ii) asset concentrations of 100% or more of total capital (loan related) or Tier 1 capital (non-loan related) by industry, product line, type of collateral, or short-term obligations of one financial institution or affiliated group; (iii) funding concentrations from a single source representing 10% or more of total assets; or (iv) potentially volatile funding sources that when combined represent 25% or more of total assets (these sources may include brokered, large, high-rate, uninsured, internet-listing-service deposits, Federal funds purchased or other potentially volatile deposits or borrowings). If a concentration is present, management must employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, third party review and increasing capital requirements. 
         Additionally, the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The guidance provides that institutions that have (i) total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land which represent 100% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital; or (ii) total reported commercial real estate loans, excluding loans secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate, representing 300% or more of the institution's total risk-based capital and the institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months, are identified as having potential commercial real estate concentration risk. Institutions, like the Bank, which are deemed to have concentrations in commercial real estate lending are expected to employ heightened levels of risk management with respect to their commercial real estate portfolios, and may be required to hold higher levels of capital. 
  Increased Focus on Lending to Members of the Military.    The federal banking agencies and the DOJ have recently increased their focus on financial institution compliance with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or SCRA. The SCRA requires a bank to cap the interest rate at 6% for any loan to a member of the military who goes on active duty after taking out the loan. It also limits the actions the Bank can take when a servicemember is in foreclosure. 
  Limitations on Incentive Compensation.    In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and other federal financial agencies re-proposed restrictions on incentive-based compensation pursuant to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act for financial institutions with $1 billion or more in total consolidated assets. For institutions with at least $1 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the proposal would impose principles-based restrictions that are broadly consistent with existing interagency guidance on incentive-based compensation. Such institutions would be prohibited from entering into incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by the institution (i) by providing an executive officer, employee, director, principal shareholder or individuals who are "significant risk takers" with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or (ii) that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. The proposal would also impose certain governance and recordkeeping requirements on institutions of our size. The Federal Reserve would reserve the authority to impose more stringent requirements on institutions of our size. We are evaluating the expected impact of the proposal on our business. 
         Cybersecurity.    In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution's management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution's operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also 
 20

   expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.
