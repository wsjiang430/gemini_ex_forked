ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
SL Green Realty Corp. is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership, management and operation of commercial and residential real estate properties, principally office properties, located in the New York metropolitan area. We were formed in June, 1997 for the purpose of continuing the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc., our predecessor entity. S.L. Green Properties, Inc., which was founded in 1980 by Stephen L. Green, who serves as a member and the chairman emeritus of the Company's board of directors, had been engaged in the business of owning, managing, leasing, and repositioning office properties in Manhattan, a borough of New York City. Reckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SL Green Realty Corp.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned the following interests in properties in the New York metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments located outside of Manhattan are referred to as the Suburban properties:

(1) | The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square feet divided by total square footage at acquisition. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units.


(2) | As of December 31, 2018, we owned a building at 315 West 33rd Street, also known as The Olivia, that was comprised of approximately 270,132 square feet of retail space and approximately 222,855 square feet of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the number of retail properties we own. However, we have included only the retail square footage in the retail approximate square footage, and have listed the balance of the square footage as residential square footage.

As of December 31, 2018, we also managed two office buildings owned by third parties encompassing approximately 2.1 million square feet, and held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of $2.1 billion, including $0.1 billion of debt and preferred equity investments and other financing receivables that are included in balance sheet line items other than the Debt and Preferred Equity Investments line item.
Our corporate offices are located in midtown Manhattan at 420 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10170. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 1,058 employees, 310 of whom were employed in our corporate offices. We can be contacted at (212) 594-2700. We maintain a website at www.slgreen.com. On our website, you can obtain, free of charge, a copy of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material electronically with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We have also made available on our website our audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, nominating and corporate governance committee charter,

code of business conduct and ethics and corporate governance principles. We do not intend for information contained on our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K. The SEC maintains a website (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the "Company," "SL Green," "we," "our" and "us" in this annual report means SL Green Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, and one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, or, as the context may require, SL Green only or the Operating Partnership only, and "S.L. Green Properties" means S.L. Green Properties, Inc., a New York corporation, as well as the affiliated partnerships and other entities through which Stephen L. Green historically conducted commercial real estate activities.
Corporate Structure
In connection with the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, in August 1997, the Operating Partnership received a contribution of interests in real estate properties as well as a 95% economic, non-voting interest in the management, leasing and construction companies affiliated with S.L. Green Properties. We refer to these management, leasing and construction entities, which are owned by S.L. Green Management Corp, as the "Service Corporation." The Company is organized so as to qualify, and has elected to qualify as a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.
Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. We are the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, and as of December 31, 2018, we owned 95.30% of its economic interests. All of the management and leasing operations with respect to our wholly-owned properties are conducted through SL Green Management LLC, or Management LLC. The Operating Partnership owns a 100% interest in Management LLC.
In order to maintain the Company's qualification as a REIT while realizing income from management, leasing and construction contracts with third parties and joint venture properties, all of these service operations are conducted through the Service Corporation, a consolidated variable interest entity. We, through our Operating Partnership, receive substantially all of the cash flow from the Service Corporation's operations. All of the voting common stock of the Service Corporation is held by an entity owned and controlled by Stephen L. Green, who serves as a member and as the chairman emeritus of the Company's board of directors.
Business and Growth Strategies
SL Green is New York City's largest owner of office real estate and an investment-grade S&P 500 company that is focused primarily on owning, managing and maximizing the value of Manhattan commercial properties.
Our core business is the ownership of high quality commercial properties and our primary business objective is to maximize the total return to stockholders, through growth in net income attributable to common stockholders and funds from operations, or FFO, and through asset value appreciation. The commercial real estate expertise resulting from owning, operating, investing, developing, redeveloping and lending on real estate in Manhattan for over 38 years has enabled us to invest in a collection of premier office and retail properties, selected multifamily residential assets, and high quality debt and preferred equity investments. We also own high quality commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area.
We are led by a strong, experienced management team that provides a foundation of skills in all aspects of real estate, including acquisitions, dispositions, management, leasing, development, redevelopment, and financing. It is with this team that we have achieved a market leading position in our targeted submarkets.
We seek to enhance the value of our company by executing strategies that include the following:

• | Leasing and property management, which capitalizes on our extensive presence and knowledge of the marketplaces in which we operate;


• | Acquiring office, retail and residential properties and employing our local market skills to reposition these assets to create incremental cash flow and capital appreciation;


• | Identifying properties well suited for development/redevelopment and maximizing the value of those properties through redevelopment or reconfiguration to match current workplace, retail and housing trends;


• | Investing in debt and preferred equity positions that generate consistently strong risk-adjusted returns, increase the breadth of our market insight, foster key market relationships and source potential future investment opportunities;


• | Executing dispositions through sales or joint ventures that harvest embedded equity which has been generated through management's value enhancing activities; and


• | Maintaining a prudently levered, liquid balance sheet with consistent access to diversified sources of property level and corporate capital.

5

Leasing and Property Management
We seek to capitalize on our management's extensive knowledge of Manhattan and the New York metropolitan area and the needs of our tenants through proactive leasing and management programs, which include: (i) use of in-depth market experience resulting from managing and leasing tens of millions of square feet of office, retail and residential space since the Company was founded; (ii) careful tenant management, which results in long average lease terms and a manageable lease expiration schedule; (iii) utilization of an extensive network of third-party brokers to supplement our in-house leasing team; (iv) use of comprehensive building management analysis and planning; and (v) a commitment to tenant satisfaction by providing high quality tenant services at competitive rental rates.
Property Acquisitions
We acquire core properties for long-term value appreciation and earnings growth. We also acquire non-core properties that are typically held for shorter periods during which we intend to create significant increases in value. This strategy has resulted in capital gains that increase our investment capital base. In implementing this strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. These opportunities may come from new properties as well as acquisitions in which we already hold a joint venture interest or, from time to time, from our debt and preferred equity investments.
Through intimate knowledge of our markets we have developed an ability to source transactions with superior risk-adjusted returns by capturing off-market opportunities. In rising markets, we primarily seek to acquire strategic vacancies that provide the opportunity to take advantage of our exceptional leasing and repositioning capabilities to increase cash flow and property value. In stable or falling markets, we primarily target assets featuring credit tenancies with fully escalated in-place rents to provide cash flow stability near-term and the opportunity for increases over time.
Management’s breadth of activities and expertise in New York City has also enabled us to identify and acquire retail properties in prime locations. Combining our real estate skills and ability to attract premier tenants has resulted in transactions that have provided significant capital appreciation. This same market penetration has permitted us to grow a portfolio of high quality, well-located multifamily properties
We believe that we have many advantages over our competitors in acquiring core and non-core properties, both directly and through our joint venture program that includes a predominance of high quality institutional investors. Those advantages include: (i) senior management's average 31 years of experience leading a full-service, fully-integrated real estate company focused, primarily, on the Manhattan market; (ii) the ability to offer tax-efficient structures to sellers through the exchange of ownership interests, including units in our Operating Partnership; and (iii) the ability to underwrite and close transactions on an expedited basis even when the transaction requires a complicated structure.
Property Dispositions
We continually evaluate our portfolio to identify those properties that are most likely to meet our long-term earnings and cash flow growth objectives and contribute to increasing portfolio value. Properties that no longer meet our objectives are evaluated for sale, or in certain cases, joint venture to release equity created through management's value enhancement programs or to take advantage of attractive market valuations.
We seek to efficiently deploy the capital proceeds generated from these dispositions into property acquisitions and debt and preferred equity investments that we expect will provide enhanced future capital gains and earnings growth opportunities. Management may also elect to utilize the capital proceeds from these dispositions to repurchase shares of our common stock, repay existing indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries, or increase cash liquidity.
Property Repositioning
Our extensive knowledge of the markets in which we operate and our ability to efficiently plan and execute capital projects provide the expertise to enhance returns by repositioning properties that are underperforming. Many of the properties we own or seek to acquire feature unique architectural design elements or other amenities and characteristics that can be appealing to tenants when fully exploited. Our strategic investment in these properties, combined with our active management and pro-active leasing, provide the opportunity to creatively meet market needs and generate favorable returns.
Development / Redevelopment
Our constant interactions with tenants and other market participants keep us abreast of innovations in workplace layout, store design and smart living. We leverage this information to identify properties primed for development or redevelopment to meet these demands and unlock value. The expertise and relationships that we have built from managing complex construction projects in New York City and its surrounding areas allow us to cost efficiently add new and renovated assets of the highest quality and desirability to our operating portfolio.

Debt and Preferred Equity Investments
We invest in well-collateralized debt and preferred equity investments in the markets in which we operate, primarily New York City, that generate attractive yields. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Knowledge of our markets and our leasing and asset management expertise provide underwriting capabilities that enable a highly educated assessment of risk and return. The benefits of this investment program, which has a carefully managed aggregate size, include the following:

• | Our typical investments provide high current returns at conservative exposure levels and, in certain cases, the potential for future capital gains. Our expertise and operating capabilities provide both insight and operating skills that mitigate risk.


• | In certain instances, these investments serve as a potential source of real estate acquisitions for us when a borrower seeks an efficient off-market transaction. Ownership knows that we are fully familiar with the asset through our existing investment, and that we can close more efficiently and quickly than others. Property owners may also provide us the opportunity to consider off-market transactions involving other properties because we have previously provided debt or preferred equity financing to them.


• | These investments are concentrated in Manhattan, which helps us gain market insight, awareness of upcoming investment opportunities and foster key relationships that may provide access to future investment opportunities. 

Capital Resources
Our objective is to maintain multiple sources of corporate and property level capital to obtain the most appropriate and lowest cost of capital. This objective is supported by:

• | Property operations that generally provide stable and growing cash flows through market cycles due to favorable supply/demand metrics in Manhattan, long average lease terms, high credit quality tenants and superior leasing, operating and asset management skills;


• | Concentration of our activities in a Manhattan market that is consistently attractive to property investors and lenders through market cycles relative to other markets;


• | Maintaining strong corporate liquidity and careful management of future debt maturities; and


• | Maintaining access to corporate capital markets through balanced financing and investment activities that result in strong balance sheet and cash flow metrics.

Manhattan Office Market Overview
Manhattan is by far the largest office market in the United States containing more rentable square feet than the next four largest central business district office markets combined. The properties in our portfolio are primarily concentrated in some of Manhattan's most prominent midtown locations.
According to Cushman and Wakefield Research Services as of December 31, 2018, Manhattan has a total office inventory of approximately 401.0 million square feet, including approximately 242.5 million square feet in midtown. We estimate that approximately 16.3 million square feet of new construction class-A buildings over 250,000 square feet will become available between 2019 and 2023 in Manhattan, approximately 43.4% of which is pre-leased. We estimate that this increase is partially offset by approximately 4.4 million square feet which will be converted from office use to an alternative use. This will add only approximately 0.6% per year to Manhattan's total inventory, net of conversions, over the next five years.
While the addition of new supply to the Manhattan office inventory is nominal relative to the size of the overall market, we view any additional supply as a positive to the Manhattan office market given the older vintage of the majority of Manhattan’s office inventory and the desire of certain tenants to occupy new, high quality, efficient office space, which often isn’t available in older vintage properties. In addition, Manhattan’s office inventory has only grown by approximately 3.4 million square feet over the last 25 years.
General Terms of Leases in the Manhattan Markets
Leases entered into for space in Manhattan typically contain terms that may not be contained in leases in other U.S. office markets. The initial term of leases entered into for space in Manhattan is generally seven to fifteen years. Tenants leasing space in excess of 10,000 square feet for an initial term of 10 years or longer often will negotiate an option to extend the term of the lease for one or two renewal periods, typically for a term of five years each. The base rent during the initial term often will provide for agreed-upon periodic increases over the term of the lease. Base rent for renewal terms is most often based upon the then fair market rental value of the premises as of the commencement date of the applicable renewal term (generally determined by binding arbitration in the event the landlord and the tenant are unable to mutually agree upon the fair market value), though base rent for a renewal period may be set at 95% of the then fair market rent. Very infrequently, leases may contain termination options whereby 
7

a tenant can terminate the lease obligation before the lease expiration date upon payment of a penalty together with repayment of the unamortized portion of the landlord's transaction costs (e.g., brokerage commissions, free rent periods, tenant improvement allowances, etc.).
In addition to base rent, a tenant will generally also pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for the building over a base year, which is typically the year during which the term of the lease commences, based upon the tenant's proportionate occupancy of the building. In some smaller leases (generally less than 10,000 square feet), in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in building operating expenses, base rent will be increased each year during the lease term by a set percentage on a compounding basis (though the tenant will still pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes over a base year).
Tenants typically receive a free rent period following commencement of the lease term, which in some cases may coincide with the tenant's construction period.
The landlord most often supplies electricity either on a sub-metered basis at the landlord's cost plus a fixed percentage or a rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is added to the base rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services, other than electricity, such as heat, air conditioning, freight elevator service during business hours and base building cleaning typically are provided at no additional cost, but are included in the building's operating expenses. The tenant will typically pay additional rent only for services which exceed base building services or for services which are provided other than during normal business hours.
In a typical lease for a new tenant renting in excess of 10,000 square feet, the landlord will deliver the premises with existing improvements demolished. In such instances, the landlord will typically provide a tenant improvement allowance, which is a fixed sum that the landlord makes available to the tenant to reimburse the tenant for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. Such sum typically is payable as work progresses, upon submission by the tenant of invoices for the cost of construction and lien waivers. However, in certain leases (most often for relatively small amounts of space), the landlord will construct the premises for the tenant at a cost to the landlord not to exceed an agreed upon amount with the tenant paying any amount in excess of the agreed upon amount. In addition, landlords may rent space to a tenant that is "pre-built" (i.e., space that was constructed by the landlord in advance of lease signing and is ready to for the tenant to move in with the tenant selecting paint and carpet colors).
Occupancy
The following table sets forth the weighted average occupancy rates at our office properties based on space leased for properties owned by us as of December 31, 2018:

 | Percent Occupied as of December 31,
Property | 2018 | 2017 
Same-Store properties (1) - Manhattan | 93.7% | 93.8%
Same-Store properties (1) - Suburban | 91.3% | 92.3%
Manhattan properties | 94.5% | 93.8%
Suburban properties | 91.3% | 92.3%
Unconsolidated Joint Venture Properties | 95.4% | 96.8%
Portfolio | 94.2% | 93.7%


(1) | Same-Store properties represents all operating properties owned by us at January 1, 2017 and still owned by us in the same manner at December 31, 2018, which totaled 40 of our 49 consolidated operating properties. 

Rent Growth
We are constantly evaluating our schedule of future lease expirations to mitigate occupancy risk while maximizing rent growth. We proactively manage future lease expirations based on our view of estimated current and future market asking rents. The following table sets forth our future lease expirations, excluding triple net leases, and management's estimates of market asking rents. Taking rents are typically lower than asking rents and may vary from building to building. There can be no assurances that our estimates of market rents are accurate or that market rents currently prevailing will not erode or outperform in the future.
