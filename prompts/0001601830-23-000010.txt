Business Overview
Recursion is a clinical stage TechBio company leading this burgeoning space by decoding biology to industrialize drug discovery. Central to our mission is the Recursion Operating System (OS), a platform built across diverse technologies that enables us to map and navigate trillions of biological and chemical relationships within the Recursion Data Universe, one of the world’s largest proprietary biological and chemical datasets. We frame this integration of the physical and digital components as iterative loops of atoms and bits. Scaled ‘wet-lab’ biology and chemistry data built in-house (atoms) are organized into virtuous cycles with ‘dry-lab’ computational tools (bits) to rapidly translate in silico hypotheses into validated insights and novel chemistry. Our focus on mapping and navigating the complexities of biology and chemistry beyond the published literature and in a target-agnostic way differentiates us from other companies in our space and leads us to confront a fundamental cause of failure for the majority of clinical-stage programs - the wrong target is chosen due to an incomplete and reductionist view of biology. Our balanced team of life scientists and computational and technical experts creates an environment where empirical data, statistical rigor and creative thinking are brought to bear on our decisions. 
We leverage our Recursion OS to enable three key value drivers: 
1.An expansive pipeline of internally-developed clinical and preclinical programs focused on genetically-driven rare diseases and oncology with significant unmet need and market opportunities in some cases potentially in excess of $1 billion in annual sales
2.Transformational partnerships with leading biopharma companies to map and navigate intractable areas of biology, identify novel targets and develop potential new medicines that are further developed in resource-heavy clinical trials overseen by our partners
3.Development of one of the largest fit-for-purpose proprietary biological and chemical datasets in the world at a time when advances in AI paired with the right training data are creating disruptive value.

Vision, Mission, People and Culture
Human biology is a highly complex system for which human intelligence alone is insufficient to fully understand. While hundreds of thousands of incredible scientists around the world dedicate themselves to expanding our understanding each day, the extraordinarily high failure rates of human-generated hypotheses in our industry suggest to us that we still understand just a small percentage of biology, chemistry and the interactions between the two.
Simultaneously, our world is currently transiting its next industrial revolution based on extraordinary progress in scaled computation, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). While progress in this field has been steady for decades, the exponential growth trajectory is becoming more apparent to many members of modern society through accessible applications like ChatGPT. While progress is being made using sophisticated computation in virtually every industry, the complexity of biology and the highly regulated nature of the biopharma industry has resulted in a delay in the fruits of technology in our space. However, this means we are in a position to learn from the lessons of the application to technology to many other fields. One of the primary lessons learned across numerous industries is that computational sophistication alone is rarely sufficient to create disruptive change. It is when computational sophistication is paired with the right data, typically in an iterative process of ongoing learning, prediction and refinement, where outsized change is created.

Figure 1. Machine learning native companies across multiple industries create iterative loops of profiling, analysis and inference2. A common theme in the successful application of ML / AI to many industries is the creation of a virtuous loop of learning and iteration. First, real systems (atoms) are profiled in order to create digital representations (bits) which can be analyzed by ML and AI to infer the rules, shapes or values of the real system. For example, digitizing the physical state of the planet using satellite imaging traffic flow, weather and other real-world data allows one to model the real world and predict optimal, real-time and flexible navigation routes.
Recursion was founded in 2013 with a vision to capitalize on the convergence of advancements in computation and machine learning to address the decreasing efficiency of drug discovery and development. We believe that this opportunity represents one of the most positively impactful applications of ML and AI. Our vision is to leverage technology to map and navigate biology and chemistry to discover and develop more, better medicines faster. We believe that neither advanced computational approaches, massive datasets, nor human intelligence alone can fundamentally shift the efficiency curve of drug discovery and development; instead, we believe that those companies that augment their teams with sophisticated computational tools leveraging hard-to-replicate proprietary datasets will have a significant advantage. We believe we are among the companies leading this burgeoning new sector of the biopharma industry that we call TechBio. Our success, and the success of this new sector generally, has the promise to drive better new medicines to patients at higher scale and lower prices. We are working hard to not only lead this space, but define it.

Figure 2. Eroom’s Law observes that while technology advancements have made many processes faster and less expensive over the years, drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive.3,4 Recursion was created to take advantage of the discontinuity between these fields and harness the power of accelerating technological innovations to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development.
Our mission at Recursion, Decoding Biology to Radically Improve Lives, flows naturally from our vision. We interpret our mission expansively and believe it to be a durable direction and source of inspiration for our team. While we are best-known for industrializing phenomics (data based on images of cellular structures), we do not feel constrained by that foundation and will use any technology or combination of technologies we see fit to decode biology. Success in decoding biology implies our ability to predict ways to navigate it. The ability to predictably navigate biology may enable us to build a massive pipeline of medicines, either by ourselves, with partners or both. As part of that work, we seek not only to radically improve the lives of patients who could benefit from the medicines we help to deliver, but the lives of those who care for those patients, the lives of our employees and their families, as well as the communities in which we operate our company.

Figure 3: Recursion’s Founding Principles and Values support our ambitious mission. Together, these elements shape Recursion’s culture by guiding our people to high-impact decision-making and behaviors.
Our culture at Recursion is designed with intention to fuel our mission. We believe culture drives delivery. Essential to decoding biology in our context, is a mindset deeply committed to achieving impact at unprecedented scale through pioneering new industrialized approaches. We call it the Recursion Mindset. To embrace this mindset and our ambition, our people must deeply learn what will make them impactful in our context while questioning what made them successful in prior contexts. Sometimes this requires unlearning. Sometimes this requires a professional metamorphosis. For everyone it requires change. To decode biology we intentionally source for an incredible breadth of fields from multiple industries and for all of them Recursion is a new kind of company. The guideposts for teaching our people to successfully transition to TechBio and deliver our mission are our Founding Principles and Values. They are the essential shape of our culture. The Founding Principles direct us in making scientific and technical decisions that further our mission. The Values define the day-to-day behaviors and mindsets that further our mission. Together, along with the brilliance, humility and diversity of our people, our culture comes to life. Together, they are the compass that point our people towards decoding biology.

Business Strategy and Value Drivers
While most small to medium-sized biopharma companies are focused on a narrow slice of biology or therapeutic area, where they believe they have an advantage or insight based on the summed experience of their team, the Recursion OS allows us to discover and translate at scale across biology. However, we are cognizant that building disease-area expertise, especially in clinical development, is essential. And so, we have developed a multi-pronged, capital-efficient business model focused on key value-drivers that enable us to demonstrate our progress over time while continuing to invest in the development of the Recursion OS, which we believe is the engine of value creation in the long-term. While our mapping and navigating tools have the plasticity to be applied across therapeutic areas and modalities, our business model is tailored to maximize value and advance programs cost-effectively based on the nature of market and regulatory dynamics associated with our three value drivers (internal pipeline, transformational partnerships and fit-for-purpose proprietary biological and chemical data).
Figure 5. We harness the value and scale of our maps of biology using a capital efficient business strategy. Our business strategy is segmented into our following value-drivers: (i) internally developed programs in capital-efficient therapeutic areas; (ii) partnered programs in resource-intensive therapeutic areas; and (iii) proprietary, fit-for-purpose training data. *Includes a single oncology indication from our Roche and Genentech collaboration.
Value-Driver 1 - Internally Developed Programs in Capital-Efficient Therapeutic Areas
Recursion is advancing five clinical-stage programs across rare disease and oncology, which we believe are capital-efficient opportunities for our growing clinical development team to focus on. We continue to advance internal preclinical programs focused on oncology to continue building our pipeline.
Value-Driver 2 - Partnered Programs in Resource-Intensive Therapeutic Areas
Recursion has made substantial progress to deliver against two transformational discovery collaborations; first a collaboration in neuroscience and a single gastrointestinal oncology indication with Roche and Genentech signed in late 2021, and second a collaboration in fibrosis with Bayer signed in 2020 and significantly expanded in 2021. We expect to continue making progress towards potential value-accreting program milestones and map-building and data option milestones.
Value-Driver 3 - Proprietary, Fit-for-Purpose Training Data
While we will direct the generation of new data and utilize the latest data in Recursion’s Data Universe to maximize our pipeline and partnership value-drivers, we increasingly see the potential to license subsets of our over 21 
petabytes of proprietary data to a growing universe of collaborators from both the biopharma and technology industries.
The Recursion OS
The creation of virtuous cycles of atoms and bits has been a competitive advantage for leaders in many industries outside of biopharma. This virtuous cycle of profiling the real (atoms) to create digital representations (bits) can be paralleled as an approach to mapping and navigating biology and chemistry as well.
Figure 6. Recursion’s virtuous cycle of atoms and bits. (1) Profile real biological and chemical systems using automation to scale a small number of data-rich assays, including phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics and ADMET to generate massive, high quality empirical data; (2) Aggregate and analyze the resultant data using a variety of in-house software tools including proprietary machine learning algorithms in both public and private clouds; and (3) Map and navigate leveraging proprietary software tools to infer relationships between biology and chemistry tested independently. These inferred relationships serve as the basis of our ability to predict how to navigate between biological states using chemical or biological perturbations, which we can then validate in our automated laboratories, completing a virtuous cycle of learning and iteration.
Specifically, at Recursion, automated wet-lab biology and dry-lab computational tools are organized in an iterative loop to rapidly translate in silico hypotheses into testable predictions, which in turn generates more data on which improved predictions can be made. The Recursion OS cycles between the profiling of real systems (atoms) and the aggregation and analysis of data (bits) to infer relationships across biological and chemical systems (mapping and navigating). Collectively, the components of the Recursion OS can be joined together to identify, validate and advance a broad portfolio of novel therapeutic programs quickly, cost-effectively and with minimal human intervention and bias - industrializing drug discovery. We use standardized, automated workflows to identify programs and advance them through key stages of the drug discovery and development pipeline as in the following graphic. 
Table of Contents

Figure 7. The Recursion OS is meant to industrialize the drug discovery and development process through multiple cycles of learning and iteration. 
Atoms
Our Recursion OS is composed of a broad suite of automated laboratory systems used to conduct standardized, high-dimensional data acquisition at scale. These data span phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics and ADME/DMPK assays. Recursion has built a physical library of approximately 1.7 million compounds, including over 1 million new chemical entity (NCE) starting point substances, a large library of known chemical entities which can serve as guideposts, and more than 500 thousand compounds belonging to our collaborators. Further, Recursion has generated a custom whole-genome arrayed CRISPR guide library. Together, these tools allow Recursion to explore millions of different biological perturbations in our own wet-labs. Our tissue culture facility has scaled the production of nearly 50 human cell types and has also enabled work at scale in co-cultures and complex iPSC-derived cell types. In 2022, for example, Recursion generated more than 500 billion human neuronal iPSC-derived cells for our partnered work with Roche and Genentech - a scale achieved by few if any other companies in the world. 
Figure 8. Diverse datasets within the Recursion Data Universe are highly complementary. The Recursion Data Universe consists of complementary datasets spanning multiple data modalities. While phenomics data can be generated cost-effectively and at scale, other datasets such as transcriptomics, DMPK and InVivomics offer increasing insight as we translate programs from early discovery through development.
Bits
The Recursion OS is built on top of a core technology stack that is highly scalable and flexible. This stack is composed of infrastructure components, such as our wholly-owned supercomputer, BioHive-1, where much of our deep learning model training and research happens. In addition, we have built a custom software stack including many proprietary tools integrated into a full-stack data collection, aggregation, storage and analysis pipeline spanning target discovery to digital chemistry.
Flowing through our software infrastructure are more than 21 petabytes of highly relatable biological and chemical data, including: phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics, ADMET assays and bespoke bioassay data we call the Recursion Data Universe. We generate, evaluate and analyze this scaled data using our enabling software tool suite, which includes a custom Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), custom applications to design large experimental layouts consisting of millions of perturbation conditions, tools and dashboards to automatically execute and continuously monitor experimental protocols and a MapApp which enables users to map and navigate core components of our data spanning more than three trillion predicted relationships. Recursion recently released a demo-version of one of our internal tools, MolRec, along with a massive open-source dataset (RxRx3), which allows potential collaborators to get a taste of how Recursion explores relationships among and between potential medicines and genes. 
Table of Contents

Figure 9. The MapApp allows our team to simultaneously view multiple relationships between genes and compounds. This proprietary software application enables us to rapidly explore inferred biological and chemical relationships in order to: (i) discover targets, (ii) predict active hits, (iii) optimize for similar or dissimilar relationships and (iv) predict mechanisms of action.
Virtuous Cycles of Atoms and Bits to Advance Programs
As of December 31, 2022, using our highly-automated wet-lab infrastructure, we have executed over 175 million experiments across different biological and chemical contexts in multiple human cell types. Experimental results reside within the Recursion Data Universe, which grows as new experiments are performed. Using this data, we apply sophisticated computational techniques to infer trillions of relationships between biological and pharmacological perturbations in silico and prioritize the most novel and promising candidates for further validation in our wet laboratories. Our mapping and navigating approach to drug discovery means that the ambitious experimental explorations that would have taken us over 1,000 years to physically execute can now be inferred nearly instantaneously due to the relatability of the datasets that we have already constructed. The computational methods at the core of mapping and navigating allow us to turn the output of each experiment from “data exhaust” into a data engine: every compound we profile is analyzed not for its activity against a single target, but for its inferred activity against all possible targets in our arrayed CRISPR library, as well as its similarity to every compound we have run before in its phenomap (digital relationship map of phenomic data) – producing a super-linear growth in biological relationships as we conduct experiments.
Figure 10. Mapping and navigating enables simultaneous genome-wide screening. Traditional pharma high-throughput screening methods screen thousands to millions of compounds simultaneously against single targets, deriving information about compound activity on that single target, but no information about other targets. Recursion’s mapping and navigating approach in phenomics enables us, in a single experiment, to infer the activity of a compound against all potential targets in our arrayed CRISPR knockout screen.
When building the Recursion OS, we first focused on discovering and validating novel biological targets because we believe that identifying the appropriate target is the most challenging step in the drug discovery process due to bias and limitations associated with the traditional approach to drug discovery. More recently, we have been actively expanding the Recursion OS to more rapidly identify novel chemical starting points, more rapidly drive chemistry optimization through structure-activity-relationships (SAR) and achieve higher success rates in translating our novel target discovery work into IND-enabled programs. In the future, we envision that we will further evolve our approach and incorporate data and techniques that improve our ability to execute clinical programs at scale, including population-scale genomics data and precision medicine tools in order to identify patients for which a potential therapeutic would be beneficial. 
Table of Contents

Figure 11. The productionized portions of the Recursion OS today. We use our proprietary software and highly-automated wet laboratory to design and execute up to 2.2 million experiments each week across diverse biological and chemical matter. Complex, high-dimensional data from these experiments are generated at a rate of up to 110 terabytes per week and aggregated and analyzed by proprietary neural networks in either distributed cloud computing environments or on our own supercomputer, BioHive-1. We leverage ML approaches to predict relationships between combinations of biological and chemical perturbations and have made more than 3 trillion such predictions. Our scientists navigate these predictions using proprietary software to discover novel relationships, which we can quickly test either in-house with our Industrialized Program Generation workflow or with clinical research organizations (CROs). As we validate or refute the predictions, our Recursion OS continuously improves. 
Demonstrable Impact
Late-stage clinical failures are the primary driver of costs in today’s pharmaceutical R&D model, due in part to inherent uncertainty in the clinical development and regulatory process. Reducing the rate of costly, late-stage failures and accelerating the timeline from hit to a clinical candidate would create a more sustainable R&D model. To achieve this more sustainable model, we believe that in its ideal state, a drug discovery funnel would morph from the being shaped like the letter ‘V’ to being be shaped like the letter ‘T,’ where a broad set of possible therapeutics could be narrowed rapidly to the best candidate, which would advance through subsequent steps of the process quickly and with no attrition. Recursion’s goal is to leverage technology to reshape the typical drug discovery funnel towards its ideal state by moving failure as early as possible to rapidly narrowing the funnel into programs with the highest probability of success. 
Figure 12. Reshaping the drug discovery funnel. Recursion’s goal is to leverage technology to reshape the typical drug discovery funnel towards its ideal state by moving failure as early as possible to rapidly narrowing the funnel into programs with the highest probability of success. 
We believe we have made progress in reshaping the traditional drug discovery funnel in the following ways:
•Broaden the funnel of therapeutic starting points. Our flexible and scalable mapping tools and infrastructure enable us to infer trillions of relationships between human cellular disease models and therapeutic candidates based on real empirical data from our own wet-labs, ‘widening the neck’ of the discovery funnel beyond human-hypothesized targets.
•Identify failures earlier when they are relatively inexpensive. Our proprietary navigation tools enable us to explore our massive biological and chemical datasets to validate more and varied hypotheses rapidly. While this strategy results in an increase in early stage attrition, the system is designed to rapidly prioritize programs with a higher likelihood of downstream success based on the exploration of high-dimensional, systems-biology data. Over time, and as our OS improves, we expect that moving failure earlier in the pipeline will result in an overall lower cost of drug development.
•Accelerate delivery of high-potential drug candidates to the clinic. The Recursion OS contains a suite of digital chemistry tools that enable highly efficient exploration of chemical space, including 3D virtual screening as well as translational tools that improve the robustness and utility of in vivo studies. 
By leveraging our Recursion OS to explore more than 170 disease programs, we have shown quantifiable improvements in the time, cost and anticipated likelihoods of program success by stage when compared to the traditional drug discovery process. We believe that future iterations of the Recursion OS will enable even greater improvements minimizing the total dollar-weighted failure and maximizing the likelihood of success. 
Table of Contents

Figure 13. The trajectory of our drug discovery funnel mirrors the ‘ideal’ pharmaceutical drug discovery funnel. We believe that, compared to industry averages, our approach allows us to: (i) identify low-viability programs earlier in the research cycle, (ii) spend less per program and (iii) rapidly advance programs to a validated lead. Data shown are the averages of all our programs from 2017 through 2022. 
Over time, we believe continued successes and improvements in any or all of the dimensions highlighted above will improve overall R&D productivity, allowing us to address targeted patient populations that may otherwise not be commercially viable using traditional drug discovery approaches. Furthermore, we have seen our unbiased approach lead us to novel targets which we believe could enable us to outperform others in highly competitive disease areas where multiple parties often simultaneously pursue a limited number of similar target hypotheses. These advantages potentially significantly expand the total addressable market for our technology. However, the process of clinical development is inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee of success.
Pipeline
All of the programs in our internal pipeline are built on unique biological insights surfaced through the Recursion OS where: (i) the disease-causing biology is well defined but the downstream effects of the disease-cause are typically poorly understood, the primary targets are typically considered undruggable, or the primary targets are not well known in the context of a disease and (ii) there is a high unmet medical need, no approved therapies, or significant limitations to existing treatments. Several of our internal pipeline programs could have potential market opportunities in excess of $1.0 billion in annual sales. We currently have four programs in active clinical studies and are preparing for a fifth program to enter a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in early 2024. In addition to our clinical stage programs, we are actively developing dozens of preclinical and discovery programs. 
Figure 14. The power of our Recursion OS as exemplified by our expansive therapeutic pipeline. All populations defined above are US and EU5 incidence unless otherwise noted. EU5 is defined as France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK. 1 Prevalence for hereditary and sporadic symptomatic CCM population. 2 Annual US and EU5 incidence for all NF2-driven meningiomas. 3 Our Targets Delta and Alpha programs have the potential to address a number of indications in the immunotherapy space. 4 Our MYC program has the potential to address a number of indications driven by MYC alterations, totaling 54,000 patients in the US and EU5 annually. We have not finalized a target product profile for a specific indication.
Clinical Programs
•REC-994 for the potential treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM — a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation has been granted in the US and EU. We expect to share top-line data in 2H 2024.
•REC-2282 for the potential treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2 — an adaptive, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted. We expect to share a Phase 2 interim safety analysis in 2024.
•REC-4881 for the potential treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP — a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted.
•REC-4881 for the potential treatment of AXIN1 or APC mutant cancers — a Phase 1b/2 study in select tumor types is expected to initiate in early 2024.
•REC-3964 for the potential treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection — a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers is underway. We expect to share safety and PK data in 2H 2023.
Preclinical and Discovery Programs
Recursion continues to develop a suite of oncology programs progressing to and in the preclinical space. We believe many of these programs will remain internal at least through early clinical trials, though a subset may be well-positioned for asset-level partnerships at the preclinical or early clinical stages.
Table of Contents

Partnerships
Recursion has made substantial progress to deliver against two large discovery collaborations; first a collaboration in neuroscience and a single gastrointestinal oncology indication with Roche and Genentech signed in late 2021, and second a collaboration in fibrosis with Bayer signed in 2020 and significantly expanded in 2021. We expect to continue to make progress to set up the potential for value-accreting program milestones and map-building and data option milestones.
Roche and Genentech
On December 5, 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Roche and Genentech with the goal to use the Recursion OS to create maps of chemical and whole genome genetic perturbations in multiple cellular contexts of relevance to neuroscience and a single gastrointestinal oncology indication. In addition, together with Roche and Genentech we will create multi-modal models and maps, including significant single-cell sequencing data supplied by our partners, to further expand and refine the number of inferred relationships we uncover. Both approaches will be used to discover and develop up to 40 collaboration programs. In 2022, we made significant progress against both the gastrointestinal-oncology and neuroscience portions of the collaboration, including cell type evaluation and significant cell scale up in support of initial Phenomap-building efforts which remain on track. 
Bayer
In August 2020, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement with Bayer AG in the field of fibrosis. In December 2021, we significantly expanded this agreement to use our mapping and navigating tools to more efficiently identify biological and chemical insights that can be advanced as therapeutic programs. In 2022, we augmented our existing phenomaps with approximately 500,000 compounds from Bayer’s proprietary chemical library, significantly expanding the chemical diversity within our phenomaps. Additionally, we initiated four (4) new Programs (for a total of eight (8) total Programs initiated to date) and advanced multiple Programs towards value inflection points. Going forward, we expect the use of our mapping and navigating tools to rapidly accelerate the scale and pace at which we can initiate additional Programs.
Business Detail
Recursion’s Founding
Recursion was founded in November of 2013 as a spin-out from the laboratory of Recursion co-founder Dean Y. Li, then Vice-Dean of Research and Professor of Medicine at the University of Utah (currently President of Merck Research Labs). In Dean’s lab, then MD/PhD student Chris Gibson (currently Recursion CEO) was working with a team to study Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM), a genetic disease for which Recursion now has a drug in human clinical trials. Their research had led them to believe that activation of a protein called RhoA played the central role in the manifestation of CCM pathophysiology in humans. They leveraged an approved drug called simvastatin that is known to inhibit RhoA activation to evaluate their hypothesis in an animal model of CCM disease. The result was the opposite of what they expected; the treatment trended towards making the mice worse, not better.
Figure 15. Modulating a hypothesis highlighted by a traditional approach resulted in a treatment that trended towards doing the opposite of what was expected.5
There were many reasons the experiment could have failed, but the real significance was that the result challenged the team to question the validity of the RhoA hypothesis that they had arrived at using traditional molecular and cellular biology tools. Coming off the failure, the team went back to the drawing board. During their work, they had noticed that human cellular models of CCM in human cells looked very different from healthy cells; that is to say that their cellular morphology was markedly different. That difference sparked an idea to try to unbias the approach by leveraging a phenotypic screen where they applied many different potential treatments to diseased cells, collected images and looked for molecules that reverted the ‘diseased’ cell morphology back to ‘healthy.’ 
Rather than use a traditional phenotypic screening approach, where people would look at the images by eye or use a very basic measure like the intensity of a single marker from the microscopy images, the team instead used very early ML approaches to make this process much more objective, quantifiable and scalable. It turned out that the ML algorithms had a much higher probability of predicting “hits” - i.e., chemical compounds that demonstrated efficacy in a subsequent completely different experiment where diseased cells were treated and measured to evaluate the level of improvement. 
They ran the best molecules from the increasingly complex assay systems through multiple different animal studies, and together with their collaborators ultimately demonstrated that two of those compounds, including what is now REC-994 (a molecule that Recursion is exploring in a phase 2 human safety and exploratory efficacy clinical trial for CCM), rescued multiple aspects of the disease in mice.

The early success of leveraging machine learning to explore complex biological data to generate novel hypotheses in a target-agnostic way compelled Chris and Dean, along with a third co-founder, Blake Borgeson to spin-out the technology from the University of Utah. They wanted to test the hypothesis of whether one could use this approach, or similar approaches, to scale drug discovery and development, and thus Recursion was born.
Industrializing the Drug Discovery Process
The traditional drug discovery and development process is characterized by substantial financial risks, with increasing and long-term capital outlays for development programs that often fail to reach patients as marketed products. Historically, it has taken over ten years and an average capitalized R&D cost of approximately $2 billion per approved medicine to move a drug discovery project from early discovery to an approved therapeutic. Such productivity outcomes have culminated in a rapidly declining internal rate of return for the biopharma industry.
Figure 16. Historical biopharma industry R&D metrics. The primary driver of the cost to discover and develop a new medicine is clinical failure. Less than 4% of drug discovery programs that are initiated result in an approved therapeutic, resulting in a risk-adjusted cost of approximately $1.8 to $2.6 billion per new drug launched.6,7,8,9,10
Despite significant investment and brilliant scientists, these metrics point to the need to evolve a more efficient drug discovery process and explore new tools. Traditional drug discovery relies on basic research discoveries from the scientific community to elucidate disease-relevant pathways and targets to interrogate. Coupled with biology’s incredible complexity, this approach has forced the industry to rely on reductionist hypotheses of the critical drivers of complex diseases, which can create a ‘herd mentality’ as multiple parties chase a limited number of therapeutic targets. The situation has been exacerbated by human bias (e.g., confirmation bias and sunk-cost fallacy). Accentuating this problem, the sequential nature of current drug discovery activities and the challenges with aggregation and relatability of data across projects, teams and departments lead to frequent replication of work and long timelines to discharge the scientific risk of such hypotheses. Despite decades of accumulated knowledge, the result is that drug discovery has unintentionally created hurdles for innovation.
Simultaneously, exponential improvements in computational speed and reductions in data storage costs driven by the technology industry, coupled with modern ML tools, have transformed complex industries from media to transportation to e-commerce. The biopharma sector, however, has been slower to embrace such innovations, except in narrow areas.
At Recursion, we are pioneering the integration of innovations across biology, chemistry, automation, data science and engineering to industrialize drug discovery in a full-stack solution built from the bottom-up across dozens of key workflows and processes critical in discovering and developing a drug. For example, by combining advances in high

content microscopy with arrayed CRISPR genome editing techniques, we can rigorously profile massive, high-dimensional biological and chemical perturbation libraries in multiple human cellular contexts. Leveraging advancements in data storage and computation, we can aggregate and analyze the massive resultant datasets to create digital ‘maps’ of human cellular biology. Finally, we can use modern AI and ML tools to infer relationships within the data, unconstrained by known biology or presumptive hypotheses. We believe that by harnessing advances in technology to industrialize drug discovery, we can derive novel biological insights not previously described by scientific researchers, reduce the effects of human bias inherent in discovery biology and reduce translational risk at the program outset.
Figure 17. Recursion’s approach to drug discovery. We utilize our Founding Principles on the right to build datasets which are scalable, reliable and relatable in order to elucidate novel biological and chemical insights and industrialize the drug discovery process.
We have used our approach to generate one of the largest biological and chemical datasets in the world (over 21 petabytes at the end of 2022) which includes proprietary phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics, ADME data and more across a large number of biological and chemical contexts. Additionally, we have built a proprietary suite of software applications within the Recursion OS which has identified over 3 trillion predicted biological and chemical relationships. The following table highlights how Recursion has scaled with respect to experiments, data and biological and chemical relationships. With our approach, we look to turn drug discovery into a search problem where we map and navigate biology in an unbiased manner to discover new insights and translate them into potential new medicines at scale. 
Table 1. Biology and chemistry are complex – data that is scalable and relatable is a differentiator. We are a biotechnology company scaling more like a technology company, as demonstrated by our growth in inputs (experiments as well as biological and chemical contexts) and growth in outputs (data as well as biological and chemical relationships). (1) Includes approximately 500,000 compounds from Bayer’s proprietary library. (2) ‘Predicted Relationships’ refers to the number of unique perturbations that have been predicted using our maps.
Business Strategy and Value Drivers
While most small to medium-sized biopharma companies are focused on a narrow slice of biology or therapeutic area, where they believe they have an advantage or insight based on the summed experience of their team, the Recursion OS allows us to discover and translate at scale across biology. However, we are cognizant that building disease-area expertise, especially in clinical development, is essential. And so, we have developed a multi-pronged, capital-efficient business model focused on key value-drivers that enable us to demonstrate our progress over time while continuing to invest in the development of the Recursion OS, which we believe is the engine of value creation in the long-term. While our mapping and navigating tools have the plasticity to be applied across therapeutic areas and modalities, our business model is tailored to maximize value and advance programs cost-effectively based on the nature of market and regulatory dynamics associated with our three value drivers (internal pipeline, transformational partnerships and fit-for-purpose proprietary biological and chemical data).
Figure 18. We harness the value and scale of our maps of biology using a capital efficient business strategy. Our business strategy is segmented into our following value-drivers: (i) internally developed programs in capital-efficient therapeutic areas; (ii) partnered programs in resource-intensive therapeutic areas; and (iii) proprietary, fit-for-purpose training data. *Includes a single oncology indication from our Roche and Genentech collaboration.
Value Driver 1 - Internally Developed Programs in Capital Efficient Therapeutic Areas
We believe that the primary currency of any biotechnology company today is clinical-stage assets. These programs can be valued using a variety of models by stakeholders in the biopharma ecosystem and most importantly, present the potential to meet critical patient needs. Further, for Recursion, these assets have a variety of additional benefits, including: (i) validation of key elements of the Recursion OS, (ii) growing our expertise in clinical development and (iii) building in-house processes to facilitate smooth interaction with regulatory agencies and advance medicines towards the market. If the Recursion OS evolves in the manner with which it has been designed, then it will improve with more iterations such that future programs could be more novel and potentially more valuable than today’s programs. In this way, operating as a vertically-integrated biopharma company that leverages technology at every step from target discovery through clinical development (and even marketing and distribution) may be the long-term business model with the most upside for our stakeholders, including both investors and patients. Furthermore, we may be opportunistic about selling or licensing assets after they achieve key value-inflection milestones so that we can re-invest in our long-term strategy.
Value Driver 2 - Partnered Programs in Resource Intensive Therapeutic Areas
We believe that in its current form, our Recursion OS is already capable of delivering many more therapeutic insights than we would be able to responsibly shepherd alone today. As such, we have chosen to partner with experienced, top-tier biopharma companies to explore intractable and resource-intensive areas of biology like fibrosis with Bayer and neuroscience with Roche and Genentech. The key advantages of these partnerships are that: (i) we are able to deploy the Recursion OS to turn latent value into tangible value in areas of biology where it would be challenging for us to do so alone; (ii) the clinical development paths for these large therapeutic areas are often resource-intensive and highly complex; and (iii) we are able to learn from our colleagues at these top-tier companies such that it could give us a competitive advantage in the industry over the longer term. This strategy also embeds us in the discovery process of large pharmaceutical companies and gives rise to an alternative long-term business model whereby we become a valued partner of many such companies. Here, Recursion would focus on discovery efforts across a broad set of programs while relying on its partners to develop and market the medicines. Based on how value is ascribed across our industry today, this model alone is not yet feasible to maximize our business impact. However, we feel that due to shifts within the biopharma industry there is some potential for this portion of our business model to accrete notable value over the long-term.
Value Driver 3 - Proprietary, Fit-for-Purpose Training Data
As has been demonstrated in many other industries, a value drive and competitive advantage can be generated from the creation of a proprietary dataset. At Recursion, we have generated what we believe to be one of the largest fit-for-purpose, relatable biological and chemical datasets on earth. Spanning multiple omics technologies and more than 175 million unique experiments, the over 21 petabyte Recursion Data Universe is of the same rough scale as those generated by some of the oldest and largest pharma companies,11 but is built from scratch in our laboratories with a fundamental purpose to be used as training data for machine learning models. Through intensive internal work, Recursion uses this data and our own algorithms and software to generate and advance our own internal pipeline of medicines (Value Driver 1), as well as in partnership with our collaborators to advance additional discovery programs (Value Driver 2). Our most recent collaboration announcement with Roche and Genentech set an important precedent - there are up to or exceeding $500M in milestones unrelated to specific drug discovery programs, but instead based on successful creation and optioning of collaboration data generated by Recursion. As our field increasingly recognizes the potential for a coming revolution in drug discovery based on virtuous cycles of atoms and bits, these data are themselves becoming a direct value driver. While we will likely direct the generation of new data and exploit the latest data in our data Universe to maximize our pipeline and partnership value-drivers, we increasingly see the potential to license subsets of our data to a growing universe of collaborators for which internal efforts would be minimal, but value could be significant.
Competitive Landscape and Differentiation
There are three key factors that differentiate Recursion from the vast majority of other TechBio companies.
1.Recursion is biology-first, while most other companies are chemistry-first. The highest probability of failure for clinical stage programs in our industry is a lack of efficacy in the intended disease state or an unexpected side-effect. These failure modes are primarily driven by picking the wrong target or not fully understanding the role of that target in broader physiology and not by failure to generate molecules that successfully agonize or antagonize the target of interest. There are of course exceptions to this, but we believe that mapping and navigating biology solves a zero-to-one type problem, while optimizing chemistry is a critical, but insufficient step alone. Because the chemistry problem is more tractable, the vast majority of TechBio companies have started (or remain) here. We believe our biology-first approach is a more critical unlock, and now have the opportunity to build on that success at low cost by adding digital chemistry and related solutions to our solution stack, especially amidst an over-crowded space.
2.Recursion integrates the wet-lab and dry-lab in-house and at scale. With scaled wet-lab (atoms) and dry-lab (bits) creating a virtuous cycle of iteration, Recursion is well positioned compared to those companies of a similar stage either focused more completely on the wet-lab only (traditional biotech or pharma companies) or dry-lab only focused companies who are facing rapidly commoditized algorithms and a challenge differentiating on non-proprietary data.
3.Recursion has achieved a significant scale and stage much earlier than other companies. With five clinical-stage programs, an exciting preclinical pipeline, and two of the largest discovery partnerships in the industry with Roche/Genentech and Bayer, Recursion has achieved a scale, level of integration and stage that few other TechBio companies have. In the context of steep competition for resources amidst challenging capital markets, this position serves Recursion well, especially compared to many of the late stage private companies with significant valuations and burn.

Figure 19. Recursion sits at a unique intersection of key advantages. Among TechBio companies, Recursion sits at a unique intersection of a (i) biology vs chemistry-first organization, focused on identifying novel relationships across biological targets and disease areas, which we believe to be the most pressing challenge in our industry; (ii) a virtuous cycle of wet-lab and dry-lab enabling virtuous cycles of iteration and proprietary insight generation; and (iii) with a scaled pipeline and partnerships differentiating from the many early startups and fee-for-service organizations.
While emerging competitors and large, well-resourced incumbents may pursue a similarly differentiated strategy to ours, we have two advantages as a first mover: (i) no amount of resources can compress the time it takes to observe naturally occurring biological processes and (ii) the growing Recursion Data Universe creates compounding network effects that may make it difficult for others to close the competitive gap.
The Recursion OS - Creating Virtuous Cycles of Atoms and Bits
The creation of virtuous cycles of atoms and bits has been a competitive advantage for leaders in many industries outside of biopharma. This virtuous cycle of profiling the real (atoms) to create digital representations (bits) can be paralleled as an approach to mapping and navigating biology and chemistry as well.
Figure 20. Recursion’s virtuous cycle of atoms and bits. (1) Profile real biological and chemical systems using automation to scale a small number of data-rich assays, including phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics and ADMET to generate massive, high quality empirical data; (2) Aggregate and analyze the resultant data using a variety of in-house software tools including proprietary machine learning algorithms on both public and private clouds; and (3) Map and navigate leveraging proprietary software tools to infer relationships between biology and chemistry tested independently. These inferred relationships serve as the basis of our ability to predict how to navigate between biological states using chemical or biological perturbations, which we can then validate in our automated laboratories, completing a virtuous cycle of learning and iteration.
Specifically, at Recursion, automated wet-lab biology and dry-lab computational tools are organized in an iterative loop to rapidly translate in silico hypotheses into testable predictions, which in turn generates more data on which improved predictions can be made. The Recursion OS cycles between the profiling of real systems (atoms) and the aggregation and analysis of data (bits) to infer relationships across biological and chemical systems (mapping and navigating). Each of these components is explored in more detail, below.
Figure 21. The productionized portions of the Recursion OS today. We use our proprietary software and highly-automated wet laboratory to design and execute up to 2.2 million experiments each week across diverse biological and chemical matter. Complex, high-dimensional data from these experiments are generated at a rate of up to 110 terabytes per week and aggregated and analyzed by proprietary neural networks in either distributed cloud computing environments or on our own supercomputer, BioHive-1. We leverage ML approaches to predict relationships between combinations of biological and chemical perturbations and have made more than 3 trillion such predictions. Our scientists navigate these predictions using proprietary software to discover novel relationships, which we can quickly test either in-house with our Industrialized Program Generation workflow or with contract research organizations (CROs). As we validate or refute the predictions, our Recursion OS continuously improves.
Figure 22. The Recursion OS is meant to industrialize the drug discovery and development process through multiple cycles of learning and iteration. The Recursion OS is built on biologically-native cycles of atoms and bits leveraging phenomics, transcriptomics and InVivomics to drive discovery and validation of targets and compounds, while chemically-native cycles of predictive DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) and automated microsynthesis drive optimization of validated hits towards development candidates suitable for human clinical trials.
Atoms
In order to create large and relatable data sets, standardization and scale are two critical requirements that can be best achieved through automation. Standardization means that the experiment is executed consistently every time, day after day, year after year - and that any deviations can be detected, tracked and quantified. It involves meticulous metadata collection, prospective/retrospective experiment execution analysis, standard results storage, quantitative quality control and more. At the same time, massive scale, with millions of experiments executed per week, requires execution of multi-step assays processed rapidly and in a tightly orchestrated manner. This combination of precise repetition, high speed and massive volumes favors relying on robots over highly trained scientists, whose time is better spent on context-specific problems. In addition, automation of high-dimensional experiment readouts at scale enables cost reductions in the large high-dimensional digital data sets that can underpin today’s cutting edge opportunities in machine learning (bits).
Automation
While we do not consider ourselves to be hardware innovators, we have leveraged a significant team of automation scientists to assemble and synchronize advanced but widely-available robotic components, such as liquid dispensers, plate washers, incubation stations, automated HPLC, mass spectrometry and automated microscopy camera systems, to efficiently execute millions of experiments per week across a variety of data-rich outputs with only a small team overseeing the process at any given time. These robotic systems are modular by design and easily configurable to allow us to create complex and variable workflows. Furthermore, we have recently operationalized a fully integrated system that processes plates continuously through all steps in our primary experimental workflows. This fully integrated system is interoperable with the existing batch processing workcells but provides greater walk-away time for our operators and greater throughput in a smaller footprint. 
Figure 23. Our high-throughput automation platforms make our labs look more like sophisticated manufacturing facilities than biology R&D laboratories. Our high-throughput phenomics platform (top) can execute up to 2.2 million experiments each week with high quality to enable downstream analyses. We are increasingly automating many other of our assays at Recursion.
Phenomics
At the core of the Recursion Data Universe is our proprietary cellular image dataset generated by our automated phenomics platform. While investigating various biological and chemical contexts, the readout remains constant: a fluorescent microscopy image that captures composite changes in cellular morphology; a cellular phenotype. We use our proprietary staining protocol to capture these changes in cellular morphology across our phenomic experiments. This protocol, consisting of six subcellular dyes imaged in six different channels, has been optimized to capture a wide array of biology across nearly any adherent human cell type that can be cultured and perturbed in laboratory conditions. As a result, we can capture the effects of a wide range of biological and pharmacological 
phenomena of interest, including phenotypic changes induced by small molecules, genetic gain- and loss-of-function, toxins, secreted factors, cytokines, infectious agents, or any combination of the above. 
Figure 24. Our fluorescent staining protocol images multiple large cellular structures to capture a holistic assessment of cellular state. We use fluorescent dyes to stain a set of common cellular substructures that are subsequently captured using fluorescent microscopy imaging. Combined with tools from the Recursion OS, this complex and rich biological data modality can inform a host of scientific questions. The top image is a composite of the 6 channels, in HUVEC cells. It is followed by faux-colored images of each of the 6 individual channels: nuclei in blue, endoplasmic reticula in green, actin in red, nucleoli in cyan, mitochondria in magenta and Golgi apparatus in yellow. The overlap in channel content is due in part to the lack of complete spectral separation between fluorescent stains.
Cellular morphology is a holistic measure of cellular state that integrates changes from underlying layers of cell biology, including gene expression, protein production and modification and cell signaling, into a single, powerful readout. Image-based -omics can be two to four orders of magnitude more data-dense per dollar than other -omics datasets that focus on these more proximal readouts, enabling us to generate far more data per dollar spent to inform our drug discovery efforts. We currently generate up to 13.2 million images or 110 terabytes of new data to the Recursion Data Universe per week across up to 2.2 million experiments. Lastly, our phenomics approach builds on the recent explosion of powerful computer vision and ML approaches driven by the technology industry over the last decade. Modern ML tools can be trained to identify the most salient features of images without relying on any pre-selected, disease-specific subject matter expertise, even if these features are imperceptible to the human eye. Using these tools, we can capture the aggregate cellular response induced by a disease-causing perturbation or therapeutic and quantify these changes in an unbiased manner, freeing us from human bias. In contrast, traditional drug discovery relies on presumptive target hypotheses and bespoke biological signaling assays that only capture narrow, pre-determined biology and thus limit the scope of biological exploration.
Figure 25. ML algorithms can detect cellular phenotypes that are indistinguishable to the human eye. Most morphological differences within our images are too subtle for the human eye to detect, but ML algorithms like those we deploy in our Recursion OS can readily distinguish between them. The heatmap of similarities shown here between learned embeddings of these images shows clear separation where even well-trained cell biologists or pathologists would be hard-pressed to describe consistent differences.
Our phenomics laboratory operates approximately 50 weeks each year. We have achieved this level of operational excellence by integrating state-of-the-art technology and adopting lean manufacturing principles. Furthermore, we ensure our lab generates consistent, accurate and precise data through the use of multiple systems: facility controls to prevent contamination of cells, rigorous assay validation and instrument qualification to ensure consistency and routine quality monitoring to automatically capture data and track all critical experiment specifications. Our quality system is designed such that we routinely monitor our performance to identify and implement the appropriate preventive and continuous improvement actions. 
Transcriptomics
We have developed an in-house transcriptomics laboratory platform, complete with walk up automation and push button digital data processing, capable of profiling up to 15,000 samples per week covering expression of nearly 20,000 genes from samples drawn from any of our biological modules. At the end of 2022, we had leveraged our transcriptomics platform to sequence over 250,000 individual transcriptome samples to improve our biological understanding of many of our programs. In 2023, we intend to scale and automate this capacity further to enable hits identified from our phenomics platform to be confirmed using an orthogonal, transcriptomic readout as part of our Industrialized Program Generation workflows. This approach of combining high dimensional, large scale data layers from the Recursion OS, across phenomics and transcriptomics, allows us to increase our confidence around which insights to prioritize for scientist follow-up, while at the same time minimizing cost and human effort. 
Figure 26. Recursion utilizes an adapted transcriptomic experimental process to leverage industry-standard sequencing systems at vastly reduced cost per sample.
InVivomics
In vivo studies are an important tool for providing an assessment of the efficacy and safety of a compound within the context of a complete, complex whole-organism system. Similar to other steps within the drug discovery and development process, conventional in vivo studies are fraught with human bias and limited in the post-study endpoints that they measure. Using our In Vivo Data Collection Infrastructure, we can collect more holistic measurements of an individual animal’s behavior and physiological state using continuous video feeds and sensor technology (e.g., temperature), surveilling animals in their home environment and analyzing readouts live throughout studies in progress. By automating the process of data collection, we can amass uninterrupted data on animal behavior and physiology across days, weeks, or even months allowing for a more accurate and holistic assessment of the animal’s health state across the entirety of the study. This data can subsequently be used to create more abstract representations of animal behavior, potentially allowing us to rapidly phenotype new animal 
models and identify in vivo disease signatures that may be more relevant for assessing compound efficacy and potential liabilities.
In 2022, our Digital Vivarium consisted of 1,000 total digital cage units and we ran 21 safety (Digital Tolerability Assay) and 14 InVivomic efficacy studies involving our drug candidates. Our Digital Tolerability Assay allows us to non-invasively monitor activity in digital cages and detect meaningful differences between treated and untreated subjects that serve as an early indicator of established disease. 
Figure 27. Our proprietary, scalable Smart Housing System for in vivo studies automatically collects and analyzes video and sensor data from all cages continuously.
ADME Data
In 2022, a total of 26 new in vitro pharmacology assays were developed and qualified for validating hits and characterizing molecules. Prioritized assays were optimized with standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control (QC) metrics and incorporated into workflows for compound prosecution and program advancement. In addition, three DMPK assays were developed in preparation for on-boarding to a custom-built integrated high-throughput robotic chemistry platform. As this data is generated, it is included in our data warehousing system that connects one-off experimental assays with the rest of the Recursion Data Universe. We have built an analytical laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment. Our analytical chemistry team supports work throughout the lifecycle of our programs, including assessing compound purity and identification for quality control, measuring compound levels in plasma and tissue samples from in vivo ADME and efficacy studies and biomarker identification and validation activities in support of preclinical and clinical translational efforts. To support SAR and the development of predictive models, we have invested in an automated, connected module to process multiple in vitro DMPK assays at scale to evaluate compounds for plasma protein binding, microsomal stability and cell permeability. Using this system we expect an operational capacity of up to 500 compounds per week.
Figure 28. Recursion’s automated DMPK system allows for automated assay execution across plasma protein binding, microsomal stability and cell permeability studies at scale to advance programs while generating state-of-the-art training data for ML and AI algorithm development. The system has been designed to allow for future potential addition of additional modules into the automated workflow such as addition in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) testing.
Cell Culture and Cell Differentiation Tools
We have built a state-of-the-art cell culture facility to consistently produce high-quality, primary mammalian cells, such as vein, kidney, lung, liver, skin and immune cell subsets, as well as stem cell-derived and cancer cell lines. Approximately 50 cell types have been onboarded to our high-throughput discovery systems, spanning primary cells, cell lines and iPSCs. In 2022, we greatly expanded our cell culture facility footprint to perform work using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Specifically, we have developed protocols using CRISPR genome editing technologies to generate knock-out or knock-in lines. We have developed protocols to differentiate hiPSC cells into several distinct cell types using 3D and 2D differentiation methods. Furthermore, we have developed internal capabilities to characterize these cells using standardized and partly automated methods to molecularly and functionally characterize the differentiated progeny. Lastly, we have developed a scalable platform to produce 50-100 billion cells of interest per week and cryopreserve cells in assay-ready frozen format. In 2022, our team produced over 500 billion hiPSC-derived cells of interest to support various ongoing projects.
Figure 29. Various cells grown at scale for phenomics assays in-house by Recursion. From top left in clockwise order: iPSC-astrocytes, Bronchial Epithelial Cells, iPSC-neurons, dermal fibroblasts, iPSC-cardiomyocytes and U2OS cells.
Table 2. Numerous and diverse cell types onboarded to our platform enable us to broadly interrogate biology. Approximately 50 human cell types have been onboarded to our high-throughput discovery systems, spanning primary cells, cell lines and cells derived from iPSCs.
We have on-boarded innovations including large scale, microcarrier-based, suspension culture systems to reduce footprint and increase growth surface for additional scale. We will continue to onboard additional cutting-edge innovations to scale our work further. We maintain a strong track record of quality and consistency in our cell culture facility by implementing facility design and control systems that are uncommon among technology-enabled drug discovery companies. These designs and controls include rigorous process validation and documentation, a personnel training and qualification program and routine quality monitoring. Our quality system is designed such that we routinely monitor our performance to identify and implement the appropriate preventive and continuous improvement actions.
Figure 30. Recursion’s recent facilities expansion has created room for further growth of its specialized high-scale precision tissue culture of diverse and complex human cell types.
Chemistry Tools
Our in-house chemistry tools include physical compound collections, state-of-the-art compound storage and handling infrastructure and high-precision analytical equipment. Our experienced team of chemists use this equipment and a network of reputable CROs to advance discovery efforts and deliver differentiated drug candidates.
We have a total in-house chemical library of approximately 1.7 million small molecules from a combination of commercial, semi-proprietary and proprietary and partner sources and use this library to identify chemical starting points for discovery campaigns. Over 1 million of these compounds reside within the Recursion’s novel chemical entity library (i.e. these are not compounds belonging to our big-pharma partners), curated by our medicinal chemists and designed for highly druggable chemical properties while avoiding undesirable chemical properties, such as poor solubility and permeability. While this library has been constructed to maximize chemical diversity, we have ensured that several analogs of many compound cores are included to help identify emergent SAR for early hits and enable rapid hit expansion into readily available analogs. Additionally, we have curated a selection of approximately 9,000 clinical-stage and preclinical compounds from public forums or filings, covering approximately 1,000 unique mechanisms of action, for which an abundance of existing data and annotations currently exist. These well-characterized molecules are frequently used as tool compounds within our work and may be advanced as therapeutic programs if the Recursion OS reveals unique and previously undisclosed biological activity. Approximately 500,000 compounds are from Bayer’s NCE library, for which we do not have structural information.
We believe that the scale of our total in-house chemical library is comparable to the scale of chemical libraries curated by some large pharmaceutical companies. We plan to substantially increase the size and diversity of our NCE library over the coming years through a combination of partnerships and investments in automated chemical microsynthesis in order to more fully understand novel biological and chemical relationships. Furthermore, we envision that an automated chemical microsynthesis system would integrate with existing sample management, synthesis and purification capabilities. With the completion of our recent wet-laboratory expansion, we now have the potential capability to store up to more than 60 million compounds (in plated formats) onsite. 
Figure 31. Our internal chemical libraries are highly diverse. This visualization of the structural diversity of approximately 1,000,000 of our in-house small molecules, where compounds are clustered based on descriptors using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, demonstrates the evenly distributed and diverse nature of our 
compounds. This diversity increases the probability that we capture useful biochemical interactions across a broad range of biology. Note that red dots indicate known chemical entities.
Bits
Processing and Data Storage Infrastructure
The Recursion OS is built on top of a core technology stack that is highly scalable and flexible. We have adopted a hybrid-cloud strategy, leveraging the benefits of both public and private cloud infrastructure depending on the context and our needs:
•Public Cloud. The public cloud is our default choice for production workloads and applications. The scale, elasticity of compute and storage and economies of scale offered by public cloud computing providers enable us to cost-effectively execute our strategy.
•Private Cloud. The private cloud, or edge computing, is used to integrate our lab data flows, including the upload of data to the public cloud.
•BioHive-1 and High Performance Computing in a Private Cloud. Much of our deep learning model training and research happens with our world-class supercomputer named BioHive-1. BioHive-1 is built on NVIDIA’s DGX SuperPod architecture and is on the TOP500 list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers as of November 2022. 
Figure 32. We believe BioHive-1 is one of the most powerful supercomputers dedicated wholly to drug discovery for a single company. BioHive-1 consists of 40 NVIDIA DGX A100 640GB nodes, which further expands our capability to rapidly improve ML models.
Enabling Software Tools
Alongside our infrastructure, we have built a suite of tools that empower our scientists to accurately design, execute and verify the quality of up to 2.2 million diverse experiments each week. Our tools, which take into account real-time onsite reagent supplies, enable consistent control strategies and design standards that make each week’s data relatable across time. Additionally, these tools automatically flag experiments or processes which miss quality 
requirements or stall at some point in the process and notify the appropriate Recursionaut, providing them the tooling needed for manual intervention. Elements of our Enabling Software Tool suite include:
•Experiment Design. The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) tracks reagent inventory and enables compound selection from our library. Custom applications design large experimental layouts consisting of millions of perturbation conditions with appropriate randomization and control strategies. Proprietary algorithms design CRISPR gene editing guide RNAs for maximal knockout efficiency.
•Experiment Execution and QC. This suite of tools and dashboards automatically executes and continuously monitors experimental protocols to ensure reliable experiment execution. Custom web applications enable our Recursion scientists to view and interact with microscopy images and associated metadata from our phenomics platform for systematic QC at both the image- and plate-level. 
Figure 33. Software tools allow our scientists to design massive experiments while complying with our complex proprietary rules for layout. This graphical interface facilitates experiment plate layout specification for experiments that can span more than 1,000 1536-well plates while ensuring the relatability and appropriate design fit for the purpose of training machine-learning algorithms.
The Recursion Data Universe
The Recursion Data Universe comprises over 21 petabytes of highly relatable biological and chemical data, including: phenomics, transcriptomics, InVivomics, ADMET assays and bespoke bioassay data. These different data modalities are highly complementary as we advance drug discovery and development programs. Phenomic data provides a broad, foundational layer of biological and chemical data, while other datasets provide greater translational insights. 
Data Processing Tools
To understand, explore and relate new or existing data in the Recursion Data Universe, we must normalize, transform and analyze the data. Our tools in this layer manage the streaming of our data at scale to the appropriate public and private cloud, the transformation of our images into mathematical representations through our in-house proprietary convolutional neural networks and the standard and custom analyses performed on our data as parameterized and requested by users. Anomalies are flagged to the team for fast resolution.
Figure 34. We convert raw images into a list of features that allows cross-image comparison. Microscopy images are run through a deep convolutional network with an architecture similar to the one above. The network is trained on our phenomics data so that, layer by layer, each image is transformed into a list of 128 features representing the cellular biology in the image. The resulting features power downstream analysis.
Biological and Chemical Activity Assessment
Our activity assessment tools enable us to evaluate the robustness of diverse disease model phenotypes and subsequently measure the activity of potential therapeutic agents within these disease models. These tools are target-agnostic by design, explore cellular biology holistically and enable the exploration of many disease models and potential therapeutics simultaneously with no significant alteration to the core platform.
Figure 35. Our proprietary user interface enables our scientists to rapidly identify compounds with maximum positive effect on a disease phenotype while minimizing side effects. The results from our empirical hit identification screens allow drug discovery teams to rapidly explore results and focus on compounds that are believed to be the most promising.
Mapping and Navigating to Drive Outcomes
Our mapping and navigating tools are a rapidly growing suite of in-house software applications designed to process and translate data from the Recursion Data Universe into actionable insights for our research and development teams to accelerate programs which fall into two categories: (i) insights into underlying biology and early therapeutic starting points and (ii) insights into the specific chemical substrate of interest. 
Recursion’s phenomaps are a massive database of relationships amongst biological and chemical perturbations inferred in silico based on phenotypic similarity. To date, we have built phenomaps consisting of whole genome CRISPR genetic knockouts as well as a large number of small and large molecule-perturbations at multiple concentrations in multiple human cell types. Collectively, these phenomaps contain over 3 trillion inferred biological and chemical relationships generated solely by ML tools without human bias. Our ability to query the relationships between any perturbations in our phenomaps changes drug discovery from an iterative trial-and-error process into a computationally-driven search problem. Furthermore, our teams use phenomaps to understand the mechanisms underpinning disease and how to manipulate them. For example, we can query the similarity (or dissimilarity) created by the CRISPR-engineered knockout of any two genes from our whole-genome arrayed CRISPR screen, revealing both known and novel drug targets never before described in scientific literature. We can also query the similarity between any small molecule in our library and all genetic knockouts, uncovering a compound’s mechanism of action and, most importantly, can infer the activity of such molecules against high-value drug targets. Using automated workflows, we can iteratively add phenotypes for new chemical compounds to our phenomaps on a weekly cadence, further expanding the diversity of chemical space that we can explore and allowing us to optimize individual program chemistry.
The computational methods enabling phenomaps allow us to turn the output of each experiment from “data exhaust” into a data engine. Unlike a traditional high-throughput screen, in which many compounds are profiled for their activity against a single target at a time, in our mapping and navigating approach, every compound we profile is analyzed not for its activity against a single target, but for its inferred activity against all possible targets in our arrayed CRISPR library, as well as its similarity to every compound we have run before in its phenomap – producing a super-linear growth in biological relationships as we conduct experiments.
Figure 36. Mapping and navigating enables simultaneous genome-wide screening. Traditional pharma high-throughput screening methods (left) screen thousands to millions of compounds simultaneously against single targets, deriving information about compound activity on that single target, but little or no information about other targets. Recursion’s mapping and navigating approach (right) enables us, in a single experiment, to infer the activity of a compound against all potential targets in our arrayed CRISPR knockout screen.
We have invested to create processing pipelines and intuitive user interfaces of our phenomaps that help our scientists navigate the breadth of these relationships and elucidate which insights are most promising. Our flagship user interface, the MapApp, enables users to mine relationships using several complementary visualizations, statistical measurements and data layers including known information about compounds or known relationships between genes and diseases to rapidly distinguish novel insights. We are looking to augment this information further to include predicted data related to physicochemical and structural properties, synthesizable compounds not yet tested on our platform, ADMET assays and in vivo experiments.
Figure 37. The MapApp allows our team to simultaneously view multiple relationships between genes and compounds. This proprietary software application enables us to rapidly explore inferred biological and chemical relationships in order to: (i) discover targets, (ii) predict active hits, (iii) optimize for similar or dissimilar relationships and (iv) predict mechanisms of action.
Digital Chemistry Platform
The Digital Chemistry Platform is a core part of Recursion’s software ecosystem, comprising an integrated suite of proprietary and commercial tools, enabling our medicinal and computational chemistry team to scalably advance programs from hit to candidate. Key components of the digital chemistry platform include: (i) unified access to and visualization of chemical structures and assay data (including internally-generated high or low-dimensional assay data, externally-generated in vitro or in vivo data and DMPK data); (ii) integrated predictive modeling, chemical search and computational chemistry capabilities; and (iii) molecular design and collaboration. Predictive modeling available in the Digital Chemistry Platform includes both commercially available predictive tools as well as internally developed deep-learning based methods and is applied to both potency and ADMET optimization. We intend to further invest in predictive and digital chemistry capabilities across three domains: (i) chemistry-centric ML model development, (ii) chemistry-centric data generation and (iii) digital and physical chemistry process development to more efficiently drive the Design-Make-Test-Analyze cycle of chemistry optimization, including the roll-out of industrialized workflows that integrate chemistry and biological assay steps autonomously. 
InVivomics Research Suite
Our InVivomics Research Suite is a proprietary collection of software tools that enable scientists to monitor and analyze behavioral and physiological data from ongoing and completed in vivo studies. Study data for individual animals or aggregated study groups can be explored in near real-time, better ensuring that the final study data will be reproducible and interpretable and allowing researchers to prepare for follow-on activities prior to final study completion. Continuous monitoring allows researchers to similarly flag unexpected effects that may arise from animal handling, dosing, or compound liabilities and modify or terminate a study as needed. At the end of the study, graphical and tabular data are automatically generated to aid in the evaluation of study results and the design of follow-up in vivo studies.
Additionally, continuous video feeds and our proprietary animal cages enable us to amass uninterrupted data on animal behavior and physiology across days, weeks, or even months. ML tools within our InVivomics Research Suite can use this data to create more comprehensive representations of animal behavior, allowing us to rapidly phenotype new animal models and identify in vivo disease signatures that may be more relevant for assessing potential compound safety and efficacy attributes.
Figure 38. The InVivomics Research Suite allows our team to track and analyze a broad range of data in ongoing animal studies. These tools enable our in vivo scientists to monitor individual subjects through near real-time video feed and data generation and review study level data.
Bridging from Recursion OS Insights to Program Advancement
The Recursion OS is an integrated, multi-faceted system for iteratively mapping and navigating massive biological and chemical datasets that contain trillions of inferred relationships between disease-causative perturbations and potentially therapeutic compounds. Individually, components of the Recursion OS can be used to build or interrogate one piece of the drug discovery value chain. Collectively, the components of the Recursion OS can be joined together to identify, validate and advance a broad portfolio of novel therapeutic programs quickly, cost-effectively and with minimal human intervention and bias - industrializing drug discovery. We use standardized, automated workflows to identify programs and advance them through key stages of the drug discovery and development pipeline as in Figure 22. 
Step 1: Inference
Using our mapping tools and infrastructure, we have profiled diverse biological and pharmacological perturbations, including CRISPR gene knockouts, soluble factors, bacterial toxins and small molecules. Recursion’s phenomaps contain trillions of inferred relationships amongst these perturbations that have been inferred in silico based on phenotypic similarity. 
In order to identify novel program starting points, it is important that the Recursion OS accurately predict relationships across diverse domains of biology. To confirm the accuracy of our predictions, we have demonstrated that our approach recapitulates hundreds of well-known biological pathways. In the example below, we illustrate our phenomap predictions for approximately 150 gene knockouts from canonical biological pathways and known agonists or antagonists of these same pathways. By comparing the phenotypes induced by these perturbations to one another using our Recursion OS, we observed that each perturbation creates a unique phenotype and phenotypes form clusters that recapitulate well-understood biological pathways, including genes involved in Bcl-2 signaling, NF-KB signaling, RAS signaling, JAK/STAT signaling and TGFß signaling.
Figure 39. Inferred relationships between genes and small molecules recapitulate well known biology. Above, we show a visualization of well studied genes and small molecules. Increasingly dark shades of red reflect an increasing degree of phenotypic similarity. Increasingly dark shades of blue reflect an increasing degree of phenotypic oppositeness or anti-similarity (which often suggests inhibitory relationships between genes, though possibly distal). 
These findings validate the accuracy of our phenomap relationships and suggest that we can use our approach to identify new drug targets or early therapeutic starting points. We begin de novo programs by searching our phenomaps with respect to (i) well-known biological pathways or (ii) human genetics data and identifying novel gene targets or compound (e.g., small molecule) perturbations that are inferred to have a therapeutic effect above statistically-defined thresholds. 
Step 2: Hit Identification
Promising compounds are automatically advanced in our Industrialized Program Generation workflows for further evaluation. First, we physically test candidate compounds in multiple concentrations and replicates using our phenomics assay, including directly in the disease-relevant background, to confirm our predictions. These experiments are designed to confirm predicted relationships of interest from our phenomaps and can be completed rapidly.
Compounds that advance from our phenomics platform are evaluated in one or more high-dimensional, in vitro orthogonal assays to confirm the relationship we observed from our phenomics platform. Today, our transcriptomics platform is used as the primary orthogonal assay within our automated workflows. However, proteomics or metabolomics assays may also be used in the future. Compounds, and related compound series, that confirm and validate in one or more orthogonal assays may be advanced to more bespoke and low-throughput assays as deemed necessary by our scientific teams. 
Throughout the early stages of this process, we have intentionally limited human intervention in order to (i) minimize bias and (ii) minimize our dependency on scientists to evaluate and analyze voluminous data packages. Rather, program advancement is automatically triggered if compounds meet pre-specified statistical thresholds. The decision to automate the decision making process, in addition to automating physical experimentation, allows us to advance large numbers of programs simultaneously and efficiently. Data from each assay is summarized in reports which can be reviewed by our scientific teams to assist with program prioritization and advancement as needed. 
Step 3: Hit to Lead 
After compounds have been empirically confirmed in multiple orthogonal assays, our medicinal chemists work to optimize early chemical starting points into drug-like molecules using our Industrialized Hit-to-Lead (iH2L) workflows. One critical step in this process is to further understand the mechanism by which compounds are demonstrating a therapeutic effect. One way in which our chemists can begin this process, is by using our mapping 
and navigating software tools to compare the phenotype of a candidate molecule to the phenotypes of (i) approximately 9,000 well-characterized clinical-stage and preclinical compounds in our library or (ii) tens of thousands of CRISPR-engineered genetic knockouts in our phenomaps. Novel chemical entities that cluster with annotated compounds and genetic landmarks may share similar mechanistic functions. The below data demonstrates the power of our embeddings to accurately cluster diverse compounds with similar mechanisms of action.
Figure 40. Compounds with the same mechanism cluster together phenotypically. Each dot represents a different compound. Compounds that are phenotypically similar reside closer together and recapitulate mechanistic similarities.
Additionally, while a compound may be active in our screens, most early therapeutic starting points have low potency and undesirable drug properties and must be optimized before advancing into in vivo and, ultimately, human studies. During the hit-to-lead process, our chemists may leverage our phenomics platform to repeatedly measure changes in compound potency and selectivity that result from changes in compound structure. Our chemists also take advantage of our Digital Chemistry Platform to conduct chemical expansion exercises across more than 1 trillion molecules in our in silico library which we can then order for further profiling.
Because this process may extend over several months, it is critical that our platform assay is highly stable over time. To ensure this stability, we test that our assay can reproduce specific measures of compound activity, such as a compound’s EC50 (the concentration of a drug that gives half-maximal response) or max-effect (the maximal response), in experiments run weeks, or even months, apart. In the example below, we ran four separate experiments of a HIF2a inhibitor known to be active against our VHL disease model over a period of three months. Dose-response curves across all four runs demonstrate a high degree of overlap, including highly similar EC50s and max-effect. Our calculated minimum significance ratio from this study, a common industry metric of in vitro 
assay reproducibility over time, is 1.076, which is highly robust by industry benchmarks12. These results demonstrate the stability of our assay and the ability to use our phenomic platform as a basis for SAR.
Figure 41. Compound activity is reproducible across experimental runs. Dose response curves from multiple runs of the same tool compound against our disease model for VHL loss-of-function show high consistency with a minimum significance ratio of 1.076.
Step 4: Candidate Evaluation and IND Preparation
Prior to nominating a clinical candidate, optimized molecules are evaluated in more complex and disease-relevant in vivo models using our InVivomics platform. This process consists of two steps. Firstly, compounds are tested in Digital Tolerability studies, during which we non-invasively monitor subject activity to confirm the most promising compound (e.g. within a series) and identify an optimal dosage. Secondly, we run efficacy studies using our proprietary cage hardware, including continuous sensors and high-resolution video systems, to assess compound effects. Readouts are reported in real time rather than at the end of a study enabling scientists to make informed and impactful decisions regarding study continuation, modification, or termination as well as program advancement.
After optimizing therapeutic drug candidates, we select those compounds that have the best chemical properties to advance through development and ultimately clinical trials. We have built the internal capabilities to drive clinical candidates through IND-enabling studies, regulatory approval processes and human clinical studies. Collectively, members of our team have been involved in hundreds of clinical trials. Additionally, we work closely with a team of external consultants across regulatory, CMC and clinical development to ensure execution success. In the future, we envision that we will evolve the Recursion OS to incorporate data and techniques that improve our ability to execute clinical programs at scale, including population-scale genomics data, industrialized biomarker development and precision medicine tools in order to identify patients for which a potential therapeutic would be beneficial. 
The End Result - A Pipeline Designed to Move Failure Early in the Process
Late-stage clinical failures are the primary driver of costs in today’s pharmaceutical R&D model, due in part to inherent uncertainty in the clinical development and regulatory process. Reducing the rate of costly, late-stage failures and accelerating the timeline from hit to a clinical candidate would create a more sustainable R&D model. To achieve this more sustainable model, we believe that in its ideal state a drug discovery funnel would morph from the being shaped like the letter ‘V’ to being shaped like the letter ‘T,’ where a broad set of possible therapeutics could be narrowed rapidly to the best candidate, which would advance through subsequent steps of the process quickly and with no attrition.

Figure 42. Reshaping the drug discovery funnel. Recursion’s goal is to leverage technology to reshape the typical drug discovery funnel towards its ideal state by moving failure as early as possible to rapidly narrowing the funnel into programs with the highest probability of success. 
We believe we have made progress in reshaping the traditional drug discovery funnel in the following ways:
•Broaden the funnel of therapeutic starting points. Our flexible and scalable mapping tools and Infrastructure enable us to infer trillions of relationships between human cellular disease models and therapeutic candidates based on real empirical data from our own wet-labs, ‘widening the neck’ of the discovery funnel beyond hypothesized and therefore human-biased targets.
•Identify failures earlier when they are relatively inexpensive. Our proprietary navigation tools enable us to explore our massive biological and chemical datasets to validate more and varied hypotheses rapidly. While this strategy results in an increase in early stage attrition, the system is designed to rapidly prioritize programs with a higher likelihood of downstream success because they have been explored in the context of high-dimensional, systems-biology data. Over time, and as our OS improves, we expect that moving failure earlier in the pipeline will result in an overall lower cost of drug development.
•Accelerate delivery of high-potential drug candidates to the clinic. The Recursion OS contains a suite of digital chemistry tools that enable highly efficient exploration of chemical space, including 3D virtual screening as well as translational tools that improve the robustness and utility of in vivo studies. 
We have leveraged our Recursion OS to explore more than 170 disease programs to a depth sufficient to quantify improvements in the time, cost and anticipated likelihoods of program success by stage compared to the traditional drug discovery paradigm. We believe that future iterations of the Recursion OS will enable greater improvements. Ultimately, we look to minimize the total dollar-weighted failure while maximizing the likelihood of success. 
Figure 43. The trajectory of our drug discovery funnel mirrors the ‘ideal’ pharmaceutical drug discovery funnel. We believe that, compared to industry averages, our approach allows us to: (i) identify low-viability programs earlier in the research cycle, (ii) spend less per program and (iii) rapidly advance programs to a validated lead. Data shown are the averages of all our programs from 2017 through 2022. 
Over time, we believe continued successes and improvements in any or all of the dimensions highlighted above will improve overall R&D productivity, allowing us to address targeted patient populations that may otherwise not be commercially viable using traditional drug discovery approaches. Furthermore, we have seen our unbiased approach lead us to novel targets which we believe could enable us to outperform others in highly competitive disease areas where multiple parties often simultaneously pursue a limited number of similar target hypotheses. These advantages potentially significantly expand the total addressable market for our technology. However, the process of clinical development is inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that we will achieve shorter development timelines with future product candidates.
Investment Roadmap
There are three key factors that differentiate Recursion from the vast majority of other TechBio companies. First, Recursion integrates both wet-lab and dry-lab capabilities in-house in order to create virtuous cycles of learning and iteration. Second, Recursion already functions at significant scale (e.g., five clinical-stage programs, an exciting preclinical pipeline, and two of the largest discovery partnerships in the industry with Roche/Genentech and Bayer, one of the largest biological and chemical datasets in the world, etc.). Third, although Recursion has built significant chemistry capabilities, Recursion was founded as a biology-first company in order to mitigate one of the fundamental causes of failure in drug discovery, choosing the wrong target associated with a disease. While emerging competitors and large, well-resourced incumbents may pursue a similarly differentiated strategy to ours, we have two advantages as a first mover: (i) no amount of resources can compress the time it takes to observe naturally occurring biological processes and (ii) the growing Recursion Data Universe creates compounding network effects that may make it difficult for others to close the competitive gap. In the future, we envision building the following technologies into the Recursion OS.
Figure 44. We continue to integrate new capabilities into the Recursion OS in order to create additional cycles of learning and iteration that can lead to a more complete understanding of biology and chemistry. In the future, we envision investing in additional digital chemistry capabilities, automated chemical microsynthesis, population-scale genomics data and other technologies.
Our Pipeline
All of the programs in our internal pipeline are built on unique biological insights surfaced through the Recursion OS where: (i) the disease-causing biology is well defined but the downstream effects of the disease-cause are typically poorly understood, the primary targets are typically considered undruggable, or the primary targets are not well known in the context of a disease and (ii) there is a high unmet medical need, no approved therapies, or significant limitations to existing treatments. Several of our internal pipeline programs could have potential market opportunities in excess of $1.0 billion in annual sales. We currently have four programs in active clinical studies and are preparing for a fifth program to enter a Phase 1b/2 clinical study in early 2024. In addition to our clinical stage programs, we are actively developing dozens of preclinical and discovery programs. 
Clinical Programs
▪REC-994 for the potential treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM — a Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation has been granted in the US and EU. We expect to share top-line data in 2H 2024.
▪REC-2282 for the potential treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2 — an adaptive, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted. We expect to share a Phase 2 interim safety analysis in 2024.
▪REC-4881 for the potential treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis, or FAP — a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted.
▪REC-4881 for the potential treatment of AXIN1 or APC mutant cancers — a Phase 1b/2 study in select tumor types is expected to initiate in early 2024.
▪REC-3964 for the potential treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection — a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers is underway. We expect to share safety and PK data in 2H 2023.
We believe that the number of potential programs we can generate with our Recursion OS is key to the future of our company, as a greater volume of validated programs has a higher likelihood of creating value. Additionally, we believe that our large number of potential programs makes us an attractive partner for larger pharmaceutical companies. The static or declining level of R&D output at many large pharmaceutical companies means that they have an ongoing need for new projects to fill their pipelines.

We have not finalized a target product profile for a specific indication. 
REC-994 for Cerebral Cavernous Malformation - Phase 2
REC-994 is an orally bioavailable, superoxide scavenger small molecule being developed for the treatment of symptomatic CCM. In Phase 1 SAD and MAD trials in healthy volunteers directed and executed by us, REC-994 demonstrated excellent tolerability and suitability for chronic dosing. CCM is among the largest rare disease opportunities and has no approved therapies to date. A Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and exploratory efficacy study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation has been granted in the US and EU. We expect to share top-line data in 2H 2024.
Disease Overview
CCM is a disease of the neurovasculature for which approximately 360,000 patients in the US and EU5 are symptomatic. Less than 30% of patients with CCM experience symptoms, resulting in the disease being severely underdiagnosed and suggesting that well more than 1 million patients may have the disease in the US and EU5. CCM and its hallmark vascular malformations are caused by inherited or somatic mutations in any of three genes involved in endothelial function: CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3. Approximately 20% of patients have a familial form of CCM that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Sporadic disease in the remaining population is caused by somatic mutations that arise in the same genes. CCM manifests as vascular malformations of the spinal cord and brain characterized by abnormally enlarged capillary cavities without intervening brain parenchyma. Patients with CCM lesions are at substantial risk for seizures, headaches, progressive neurological deficits and potentially fatal 
hemorrhagic stroke. Current non-pharmacologic treatments include microsurgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery. Given the invasive and risky nature of these interventions, these options are reserved for a subset of patients with significant symptomatology and/or easily accessible lesions. Rebleeds and other negative sequelae of treatment further limit the effectiveness of these interventions. There is no approved pharmacological treatment that affects the rate of growth of CCM lesions or their propensity to bleed or otherwise induce symptoms. CCM can be a severe disease resulting in progressive neurologic impairment and a high risk of death due to hemorrhagic stroke.
Figure 46. Vascular malformations (cavernomas) in the brain of a CCM patient.13
Insight from Recursion OS
CCM2 knock-down in human endothelial cells reveal pronounced structural and functional phenotypes that are distinct from healthy cells. We hypothesized that these observed structural changes could be used to enable unbiased drug discovery. Fluorescent microscopy and automated cellular quantification and profiling software enabled high throughput analysis. More than 2,000 commercially available and known chemical entities were rapidly evaluated with this strategy based on the hypothesis that hits from this library could be more quickly translated to the clinic. The novel use of REC-994 for CCM was discovered leveraging this early form of the Recursion OS. The exciting aspect of this novel, unbiased approach was that the drug candidates chosen using automated software analysis outperformed those chosen by human analysis in subsequent orthogonal screens.

According to a machine learning classifier trained on images, REC-994 shows image-based rescue.
REC-994 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to alleviate neurological symptoms associated with CCM and potentially reduce the accumulation of new lesions. REC-994 is an orally bioavailable superoxide scavenger with pharmacokinetics supporting once-daily dosing in humans. The putative mechanism of action of REC-994 is through reduction of reactive oxygen species and decreased oxidative stress that leads to stabilization of endothelial barrier function. In addition, REC-994 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties which could be beneficial in reducing disease-associated pathology. 

Figure 48. REC-994 mechanism of action and proposed potential therapeutic impact.
Preclinical
The activity of REC-994 as a potential treatment for CCM was further confirmed in orthogonal functional assays and in acute and chronic in vivo models. REC-994 demonstrated benefit on acute to subacute disease-relevant hemodynamic parameters such as vascular dynamics and vascular permeability. Chronic administration of REC-994 was also tested in two endothelial-specific knockout mouse models for the two most prevalent genetic causes, CCM1 and CCM2. These mouse models faithfully recapitulate the CNS cavernous malformations of the human disease. Mice treated with REC-994 demonstrated a decrease in lesion number and/or size compared to vehicle treated controls. Notably, 24-hour circulating plasma levels of REC-994 in this in vivo experiment were consistent with exposures seen in humans at a 200 mg daily dose.

Clinical
We conducted a Phase 1 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study in 32 healthy human volunteers using active pharmaceutical ingredients with no excipients in a powder-in-bottle (PIB) dosage form. Results showed that systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) generally increased in proportion to REC-994 dose after both single and multiple doses. Median Tmax and t1/2 appeared to be independent of dose. There were no deaths or SAEs reported during this study and no TEAEs that led to the withdrawal of subjects from the study. These data supported a MAD study in healthy human volunteers.
A subsequent Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study was conducted in 52 healthy human volunteers and was designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and PK of multiple oral doses of REC-994, to bridge from the PIB

dosage form to a tablet dosage form, as well as to assess the effect of food on PK following a single oral dose. Overall, multiple oral doses of REC-994 were well tolerated in healthy male and female subjects at each dose level administered in this study. There appeared to be no dose-related trends in TEAEs, vital signs, ECGs, pulse oximetry, physical examination findings, or neurological examination findings. Pharmacokinetic results support once-daily oral dosing with the tablet formulation.

A two-part Phase 2 study is underway. Part 1 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the safety, efficacy and PK of daily doses of REC-994 (200 mg and 400 mg) compared to placebo in participants with symptomatic CCM over a treatment period of 12 months. Part 2 is an optional, double-blind, long-term extension (LTE) study of daily doses of REC-994 (200 mg and 400 mg) for participants completing Part 1 of the study. Currently, there is no development or regulatory precedent or pathway for CCM drug development. Results from the ongoing Phase 2 study are expected to inform a pivotal trial design with guidance from the FDA.
Figure 51. Phase 2 clinical trial schematic for REC-994. Phase 2 trial design to assess the efficacy and safety of REC-994 in patients with symptomatic CCM. Enrollment criteria includes MRI-confirmed lesion(s), diagnosis of familial or sporadic CCM and having symptoms directly related to CCM. Primary outcome measures are safety and 
tolerability. Secondary measures are focused on efficacy, including clinician-measured outcomes, imaging of CCM lesions, acute stroke scales and patient reported outcomes.
Competitors
To our knowledge, the REC-994 program is the only industry-sponsored therapeutic program in clinical trials for CCM. If approved, REC-994 would be the first pharmacologic disease-modifying treatment for CCM, one of the largest areas of unmet need in the rare disease space. Other ongoing research includes an investigator-initiated study of a marketed therapeutic and a preclinical industry-sponsored program.
•Investigators at the University of Chicago are evaluating the efficacy of atorvastatin, or Lipitor, on reduction in hemorrhage rate in patients with CCM. As of February 2023, the phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-site clinical trial is ongoing with an estimated study completion date of June, 2025.
•Neurelis is currently in preclinical development of NRL-1049, a repurposed ROCKi to potentially reduce the accumulation of new lesions and alleviate neurological symptoms in patients with CCM.
REC-2282 for Neurofibromatosis Type 2 - Phase 2/3
REC-2282 is a small molecule HDAC inhibitor being developed for the treatment of NF2-mutant meningiomas. In previous clinical studies, the molecule has been well tolerated, including in patients dosed for multiple years, and potentially reduced cardiac toxicity that differentiates it from other HDAC inhibitors. In contrast to approved HDAC inhibitors, REC-2282 is both CNS-penetrant and orally bioavailable. An adaptive, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted. We expect to share a Phase 2 interim safety analysis in 2024.
Disease Overview
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an autosomal dominant, inherited, rare, tumor syndrome that predisposes affected individuals to multiple nervous system tumors, the most common of which are bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intracranial meningiomas, spinal meningiomas and other spine tumors such as ependymomas.
Approximately one-half of individuals with NF2 have meningiomas and most of these individuals will have multiple meningiomas. In patients with NF2 the incidence of meningiomas increases with age, and lifetime risk may be as high as 75%. Combined, we believe NF2-driven meningiomas occur in approximately 33,000 patients per year in the US and EU5. Patients with NF2 are diagnosed typically in their late teens or early 20s and present with hearing loss which is usually unilateral at the time of onset, focal neurological deficits and symptoms relating to increasing intracranial pressure.
Although most meningiomas are benign their location often makes complete resection untenable, and subsequently patients with NF2 experience loss of hearing, facial paralysis, poor balance and visual difficulty. Spinal tumors can result in weakness and disability and some patients become wheelchair bound. Many patients with multi-tumor disease die in early adulthood. Due to the catastrophic nature of the disease and lack of non-surgical options for management, new approaches to treatment are needed, particularly those directed toward shrinking tumor burden. 
Insight from Recursion OS
To select REC-2282 for our NF2 program, we employed our brute-force approach by developing a high content phenotypic screen to identify cellular and structural changes associated with the genetic knockdown of NF2 by siRNA in HUVEC cells. Transfected NF2-deficient cells were treated with thousands of compounds to discover molecules that restored the structural defects associated with loss of NF2. REC-2282 reversed this complex cellular phenotype back to a healthy state (wildtype) in four independent screens at concentrations between 0.1 to 1 μM, in line with efficacious concentration levels in our preclinical experiments. Additionally, REC-2282 failed to exhibit the same level of dose dependent rescue in the evaluation of hundreds of other tumor suppressor or oncogene knockdown models, providing further evidence of a selective effect in the specific context of NF2 loss of function. Together, these experiments demonstrated robust and reproducible activity in disease relevant settings suggesting the therapeutic potential of REC-2282 in treating NF2-mutant tumors.
Figure 52. REC-2282 rescued the loss of NF2. A) Immunofluorescent images of human endothelial cells treated with siRNA control or siRNA NF2. B) REC-2282 rescued the high-dimensional disease phenotype as evidenced with a left shift from the disease to the healthy state.

REC-2282, is an orally bioavailable, CNS-penetrating, pan-histone deacetylase, or HDAC, inhibitor with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway modulatory activity. By comparison to marketed HDAC inhibitors, REC-2282 is uniquely suited for patients with NF2 and NF2-mutant CNS tumors, due to its oral bioavailability, CNS-exposure and lack of cardiovascular liabilities.
Figure 53. REC-2282 would be a first-in-class HDAC inhibitor for the potential treatment of NF2 meningiomas. We believe REC-2282 is well suited for NF2 vs other HDAC inhibitors due to its oral bioavailability and CNS-exposure.15,16,17
NF2 disease is driven by mutations in the NF2 gene, which encodes an important cell signaling modulator, merlin. Loss of merlin results in activation of multiple signaling pathways converging on PI3K/AKT/mTOR among others and results in enhanced cell proliferation. Anti-neoplastic effects of HDAC inhibitors, like REC-2282, are thought to derive primarily via disruption of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-HDAC interaction, and the subsequent inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling leading to growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells.
We obtained a global license for REC-2282 from the Ohio State Innovation Foundation in December 2018. Orphan drug designation for REC-2282 in NF2 has been granted in the US and EU. Fast Track Designation for REC-2282 in NF2-mutated meningioma was granted in the US in 2021.

Preclinical
After we discovered the novel use of REC-2282 for NF2 using our platform, we performed a literature search to better understand the molecule and validate disease models. REC-2282 has been shown to be pharmacologically active in various cancer cell lines and mouse xenograft models. REC-2282 had been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation of vestibular schwannoma, or VS, and meningioma cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at doses that correlate with AKT inactivation. In preclinical models, REC-2282 inhibited the growth of primary human VS and Nf2-deficient mouse schwannoma cells, as well as primary patient-derived meningioma cells and the benign meningioma cell line, Ben-Men-1.
In animal models of NF2, REC-2282 suppressed in vivo tumor growth of an Nf2-deficient mouse vestibular schwannoma allograft. In addition, REC-2282 suppressed in vivo tumor growth of human vestibular schwannoma xenograft models in mice fed chow formulated to deliver 25 mg/kg/day REC-2282 for 45 days. REC-2282 also suppressed the growth of meningioma cells in an orthotopic mouse model of NF2-deficient meningioma that contained luciferase-expressing Ben-Men-1 meningioma cells. These animal data served as a functional and orthogonal validation of our platform findings.

Clinical
Four Investigator-Sponsored Trials (ISTs) of REC-2282 (previously referred to as AR-42) have been completed. In study AR-42-001, REC-2282 was administered as monotherapy. In the other 3 trials, REC-2282 was administered in combination with anti-neoplastic agents: decitabine (AR-42-002), pazopanib (AR-42-003) and pomalidomide (AR 42 004), respectively. In these studies, REC-2282 was given to 77 patients with solid or hematological malignancies in doses ranging from 20 mg to 80 mg three times a week for three weeks followed by one week off-treatment in four-week cycles. Multiple patients were treated for multiple years using this dosing regimen at the 60 mg dose and the longest recorded treatment duration is 4.4 years at the 40 mg dose. The majority of adverse events were transient cytopenia that did not result in dose reduction or stoppage. The MTD in patients with solid tumors was determined to be 60 mg. The REC-2282 plasma exposure in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors generally increased with increasing doses. There were no consistent signs of plasma REC-2282 accumulation across a 19-day administration period nor obvious differences in PK between hematologic and solid tumor patients.
In another early Phase 1 pharmacodynamic IST conducted by Ohio State University, it appeared that REC-2282 suppressed aberrant activation of ERK, AKT and S6 pathways in vestibular schwannomas from adult patients undergoing tumor resection. These results may be difficult to achieve with single pathway inhibitors of ALK or MEK.
Recursion is currently conducting an adaptive, Phase 2/3, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of REC-2282 in patients with progressive NF2-mutated meningiomas with underlying NF2 disease and sporadic meningiomas with documented NF2 mutations. The study is designed to accelerate the path to potential product registration by allowing for initiation of a confirmatory Phase 3 study prior to full completion of Phase 2. It is a combined Phase 2/3 study design, beginning with a Proof-of-Concept Phase 2 portion in which 20 adult subjects and up to nine adolescent subjects will begin treatment on two active dose arms. Subject safety will be monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee, which will apply dose modification and stopping rules as indicated. After all 20 adult subjects have completed six months of treatment, an interim analysis will be performed for the purpose of 1) determination of go/no-go criteria for Phase 3 portion of the study, 2) selection of the dose(s) to carry forward, 3) re-estimation of sample size for the planned Phase 3 and 4) agreement from FDA to initiate Phase 3. Subjects in the Phase 2 portion will continue treatment for up to 26 months total and then have the option to enroll in an Extension study. The Phase 3 portion currently requires recruitment of an additional 60 subjects (adult and potentially adolescent subjects), who will receive treatment for up to 26 months. The planned primary endpoint is Progression-Free Survival (PFS).

REC-4881 for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) - Phase 2
REC-4881 is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 being developed to reduce polyp burden and progression to adenocarcinoma in FAP patients. REC-4881 has been 
well tolerated in prior clinical studies. A Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study is underway. Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU as well as Fast Track Designation in the US have been granted.
Disease Overview
FAP is a rare tumor predisposition syndrome affecting approximately 50,000 patients in the US and EU5 with no approved therapies. FAP is a genetic disorder resulting from a heterogeneous spectrum of point mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The APC gene is a tumor suppressor gene which encodes a negative regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. 
FAP is characterized by progressive development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the lower gastrointestinal tract, mainly in the colon and rectum, and is associated with up to a 100% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer before age 40, if left untreated. Standard of care for patients with FAP is colectomy in late teenage years. Without surgical intervention, affected patients will progress to colorectal cancer by early adulthood. Post-colectomy, patients receive endoscopic surveillance every 6-12 months to monitor disease progression given the ongoing risk of malignant transformation. 
Despite removing the main at-risk organ, approximately 50% of patients will develop adenomatous lesions in the neo-rectum. Once endoscopic management is no longer sufficient, additional surgical procedures are required. Similarly, these patients also develop duodenal (particularly ampullary) adenomas which also require endoscopic management. In the presence of larger adenomas and evidence of carcinoma, patients require additional localized surgery, including radical Whipple procedures. There are currently no approved therapies for FAP.
Insights from Recursion OS
The novel use of REC-4881 for FAP was discovered by leveraging knock-down of the FAP disease gene APC in human cells using the Recursion OS. To select REC-4881 as a potential therapeutic for FAP, Recursion developed a high content phenotypic screen to identify cellular and structural changes associated with knockdown of APC using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Using machine vision and automated analysis software, Recursion quantified hundreds of cellular parameters associated with APC knockdown. This complex phenotype was used as the basis for a chemical screen of more than 3,000 known drugs and bioactive compounds, revealing several RAF and MEK inhibitors, including REC-4881, which reversed the structural defects associated with loss of APC. REC-4881 exhibited highly specific and potent reversal of cellular phenotypes when compared to the MEK inhibitors selumetinib and binimetinib.
Figure 57. REC-4881 rescued phenotypic defects of cells with APC knockdown. Compared to thousands of other molecules tested, REC-4881 rescued phenotypic defects substantially better (including better rescue than other MEK inhibitors) for APC-specific knockdown.
REC-4881 is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 (IC50 2-3 nM and 3-5 nM, respectively) that is being developed to reduce polyp burden and progression to adenocarcinoma in FAP patients. We obtained a global license for REC-4881 from Takeda Pharmaceuticals 
(TAK-733) in May 2020. Orphan drug designation for REC-4881 in FAP and APC-driven tumors was granted by the FDA in 2021. 
FAP is driven by loss of function of APC, which is a critical component of the β-catenin destruction complex, leading to aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway. This Wnt-on state can lead to RAS stabilization, activation of the RAS/ERK pathway and the activation of MYC, leading to cell proliferation and survival - including the growth of adenomas seen in FAP. REC-4881 inhibits MEK1/2 thereby inhibiting ERK activation, decreasing MYC activity, restoring cells back to a Wnt-off state and inhibiting cell proliferation.
Lending further support for the use of MEK inhibitors in FAP, studies have shown that ERK signaling is activated in adenoma epithelial cells and tumor stromal cells, including fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells. In addition, genomic events resulting in alteration of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, such as activating mutations in KRAS, are frequent somatic events that promote the growth of adenomas in FAP. Overall, suppression of aberrant MAPK signaling in adenomas of FAP with REC-4881 has the potential to regress or slow the growth of these tumors by acting on core pathways driving their growth. 
Figure 58. REC-4881 inhibits APC-mutation induced MAPK signaling to block cell proliferation in the context of FAP. A potential mechanism of action of REC-4881 in cells with loss of function mutations in APC.21
Preclinical
We validated the findings from the initial phenotypic screens using tumor cell lines and spheroids grown from human epithelial tumor cells with a mutation in APC. REC-4881 inhibited both the growth and organization of spheroids in these models and, in tumor cell lines, had well over a 1,000-fold selectivity range in cells harboring APC mutations. 
We subsequently evaluated REC-4881 in a disease relevant preclinical model of FAP. Mice harboring truncated Apc, or ApcMin, were treated with multiple oral daily doses of REC-4881 or celecoxib (as a comparator) over an eight-week period. Mice treated with celecoxib had approximately 30% fewer polyps than did those treated with vehicle, whereas mice treated with 1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg REC-4881 exhibited approximately 50% fewer polyps than

vehicle-treated mice. Mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg REC-4881, the highest dose tested, exhibited an approximately 70% reduction in total polyps. 
In FAP, polyps arising from mutations in APC may progress to high-grade adenomas through accumulation of additional mutations and eventually to malignant cancers. To evaluate the activity of REC-4881 on both benign polyps and advanced adenomas, gastrointestinal tissues from mice treated with REC-4881 were histologically evaluated and polyps were classified as either benign or high-grade adenomas. While celecoxib reduced the growth of benign polyps in the model, a large proportion of polyps that remained were dysplastic. By contrast, treatment with REC-4881 specifically reduced not only benign polyps, but also precancerous high-grade adenomas, a finding with the potential for translational significance.

GI polyp count (left panel) and the percent of high grade adenomas (right panel) after oral administration of indicated dose of REC-4881, celecoxib, or vehicle control for 8 weeks. Polyp count at the start of dosing reflects animals sacrificed at the start of study (15 weeks of age). P < 0.001 for all REC-4881 treatment groups versus vehicle control. Quantification of high-grade adenomas versus total polyps was based on blinded histological review by a pathologist. While celecoxib reduces benign polyps, the majority of remaining lesions are high grade adenomas. By contrast, REC-4881 reduces both polyps and high-grade adenomas.
Clinical 
In the Phase 1 dose escalation study previously conducted by Millenium Pharmaceuticals in 51 participants with non-hematologic malignancies (Study C20001), TAK-733 (REC-4881) was administered in the dose range of 0.2 mg QD to 22 mg QD for 21 days. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 16 mg QD in this study. In this study, REC 4881 exposures increased in a less than dose-proportional manner. 
The most commonly reported AEs were rashes, with rash of any type reported in 34 participants (67%); 4 of the 7 participants who discontinued study drug treatment due to an AE discontinued for rash or some type of skin condition. Fourteen (27%) participants experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent SAE; the only SAEs that occurred in more than 1 participant were metastatic melanoma (3 participants; 6%), pulmonary embolism (2; 4%) and anemia (2; 4%). Five participants died during the study; all deaths were due to disease progression.
REC-4881-101 was a safety and PK study conducted by Recursion in healthy volunteers to confirm comparability of REC-4881 with TAK-733. Twenty-five (25) healthy participants, separated into 2 cohorts, were exposed to single doses of REC-4881 4 mg and 8 mg (under fed and fasting conditions) and single doses of REC-4881 12 mg (under fasting conditions). Each cohort received single doses of study drug across 3 study periods with each period separated by 14 days.
REC-4881 was generally well tolerated. No deaths or SAEs were reported during the study. For both cohorts, the percentage of participants reporting TEAEs was comparable between participants who received REC-4881 and placebo. No apparent relationship with the dose of REC-4881 or food conditions was observed. All TEAEs were 
assessed by the Investigator as being of Grade 1 severity except 1 (blurred vision reported with 4 mg REC-4881/fed). Two additional participants reported treatment-related eye disorders (blurred vision in both eyes in 1 participant with 8 mg REC-4881/fasted and vitreous floaters in 1 participant with 12 mg REC-4881/fasted). In all instances, the symptoms resolved. Notably, no instance of QTcF abnormality (change from baseline or prolongation) was noted in these healthy participants.
A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of REC-4881 in classical FAP patients is underway. The study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 will evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability and PD in participants with FAP following administration of REC-4881 in single and multiple doses. Part 2 will assess the efficacy, safety, PK and PD following administration of once daily doses of REC-4881 to participants with FAP who have previously undergone a colectomy/proctocolectomy and have a confirmed germline APC mutation. Study drug will be administered orally for 6 months. Recent protocol amendments were aimed at enhancing the quality and pace of the trial.

There are four primary therapeutic approaches in clinical development for FAP; all are focused on reduction in colorectal polyposis.
•Guselkumab (Tremfya) is an IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that recently completed Phase 1b development in March 2022 by Janssen Pharmaceuticals. It is hypothesized to reduce cytokine production, inflammation and rectal/pouch polyp burden in patients with FAP.
•Eicosapentaenoic acid-free fatty acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid currently in Phase 3 development for FAP by S.L.A. Pharma AG. Eicosapentaenoic acid-free fatty acid is hypothesized to reduce polyp formation due to its activity as a competitive inhibitor of arachidonic acid oxidation.
•A combination of eflornithine (CPP-1X) and sulindac (Flynpovi) is in development by Cancer Prevention Pharma for FAP and, in a recent Phase 3 study, the incidence of disease progression with the combination 
was not significantly lower than either drug alone. The company submitted an NDA in June 2020, and it remains under review. The company withdrew their MAA application in October 2021. 
•Encapsulated rapamycin, or eRAPA, is currently in Phase 2 development by Emtora Biosciences for FAP and is hypothesized to reduce tumor formation through its inhibitory effect on the mTOR pathway.
REC-4881 for AXIN1 or APC Mutant Cancers - Phase 1b/2
REC-4881 is an orally bioavailable, non-ATP-competitive allosteric small molecule inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 being developed for the treatment of AXIN1 or APC mutant cancers. REC-4881 was well tolerated in prior clinical studies, demonstrating dose dependent increases in exposure with no reported ocular toxicities typically associated with this class. We expect to initiate a Phase 1b/2 biomarker enriched basket study across select AXIN1 or APC mutant tumors in early 2024.
Disease Overview
AXIN1 and APC function as critical tumor suppressors that form part of the beta-catenin destruction complex, directly and indirectly regulating beta-catenin and RAS levels, respectively, in the cell. Aberrant activation of the Wnt and RAS pathways through inactivating mutations in AXIN1 or APC appears frequently across a wide variety of human cancers with an estimated 65,000 patients in the US and EU5 eligible for treatment. These tumors are often considered clinically aggressive and less sensitive to treatments with chemotherapies and/or immunotherapies, representing a heavily refractory population. Accordingly, there is a substantial need for developing therapeutics for patients harboring mutations in AXIN1 or APC, as these mutations are considered undruggable. There are no treatments specifically approved for AXIN1 or APC mutant cancers. 
Insight from Recursion OS
The REC-4881 program for AXIN1 or APC mutant cancers is our first program nominated solely based on our inferential search approach. In our HUVEC map, we discovered that REC-4881 exhibited a phenotypically opposite relationship across clinically relevant doses to the gene knockout of AXIN1, in addition to the previously uncovered relationship with APC. We interpreted this relationship as a second novel insight around this molecule and that the use of REC-4881 could potentially restore the biological consequences driven by AXIN1 or APC loss, found in many cancers. 
Two additional insights provided us with conviction in this interpretation:
•AXIN1 and APC are central components of the beta-catenin destruction complex. This destruction complex physiologically regulates the levels of beta-catenin and RAS in cells. As AXIN1 and APC exist together in a complex, they are considered functionally related. Our map revealed a strong degree of phenotypic similarity between the gene knockout of AXIN1 and APC, suggesting that this axis of biology is recapitulated in our high dimensional embedding space. 
•Our Phase 2 program for REC-4881 in FAP was initiated using our brute-force screen approach where we discovered a dose dependent cellular restoration from a modeled disease state (APC gene knockdown by siRNA) to a modeled healthy state (wildtype) in the U2OS cell type. Our map imputed a similar phenotypic effect with REC-4881 across doses in HUVEC, suggesting alignment between the brute-force approach and the inferential search approach. These discoveries arose from two different cell contexts, were conducted at different points in time, and under different conditions, robustly validating our interpretation.
Figure 61. Insights from Recursion OS. REC-4881 displays a phenotypic opposite relationship across clinically relevant doses to genetic knockout of AXIN1 and APC in HUVEC. 
Preclinical
On the basis of our inference generation from our Recursion OS, we advanced REC-4881 into two PDX mouse studies, focusing on HCC and Ovarian tumors. A PDX clinical trial (PCT) is a population study with PDX models that can be used to assess efficacy and predict responders to treatment in the preclinical setting. Across 29 total PDX models, treatment with single-agent REC-4881 resulted in a significantly better response in AXIN1 or APC mutant models versus wildtype models. These responses led to a significant benefit in PFS (modeled as the time of tumor doubling from baseline), observed specifically in AXIN1 or APC mutant models, providing further evidence of a biomarker driven effect.

REC 3964 for Clostridioides difficile Infection - Phase 1
REC-3964 is an orally active, small molecule inhibitor of C. difficile glucosyltransferase. This molecule has the potential to prevent recurrent disease and be used as secondary prophylaxis therapy in high-risk patients with C. difficile infections, a leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers is underway. We expect to share safety and PK data in 2H 2023.
Disease Overview
C. difficile-induced diarrhea is a leading cause of antibiotic-induced diarrhea and arises from the disruption of normal bacterial flora in the colon. Toxins A, or TcdA, and B, or TcdB, secreted by the bacterium are responsible for considerable morbidity, including severe diarrhea, colitis, toxic megacolon, sepsis, extended hospital stays and potentially, death. More than 730,000 patients are diagnosed in the US and EU5 each year. Recurrence of disease occurs in 20-30% of patients treated with standard of care. Standard of care includes antibiotic therapies which can further impair gut flora and lead to relapse.
Insight Recursion OS
REC-3964 is a new chemical entity that was identified with our brute-force approach which utilized phenomics to identify cellular and structural changes in epithelial cells associated with the pathological changes resulting from exposure to C. difficile toxins. Structure-activity-relationship (SAR) was driven through the Recursion OS to identify structural series that restored structural defects resulting from C. difficile toxins’ effects. REC-3964 was identified from a lead benzodiazepinedione structural series that confers selective antagonism against the C. difficile toxins’ effects with nanomolar potency on our platform, and dose dependent cellular restoration to a modeled healthy state in human endothelial cells. 
Figure 63. REC-3964 rescued the phenotype of human epithelial cells treated with C. difficile toxin. REC-3964 was identified as demonstrating strong dose-responsive rescue in HUVEC cells treated with C. difficile toxin b on Recursion’s phenomics platform.
We aim to develop REC-3964 as the first safe and efficacious, orally bioavailable, small molecule toxin inhibitor of C. difficile, which could be used to prevent recurrent disease and potentially used as secondary prophylaxis in high-risk patients, including elderly immunocompromised patients in long-term care facilities who have a history of related infections and hospitalizations. In addition, this molecule represents a novel mechanism that could be used in combination with currently approved and novel antimicrobials in development for this disease. Unlike antibiotic treatments that can eliminate the gut microbiota and further enhance C. difficile infection, this toxin-targeted mechanism would not be expected to negatively impact the gut microbiome. REC-3964 could have the potential to offer protection against recurrent C. difficile infections, thereby preventing significant morbidity and mortality. 
Preclinical 
REC-3964 was validated in orthogonal functional assays including the Electrical Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) assay where it demonstrated concentration-dependent activity in blocking toxin-mediated barrier disruption. We have shown in a target-based validation assay that REC-3964 selectively inhibits the toxin’s innate glucosyltransferase (IC50 = 1.2-10 nM), suggesting suppression of toxin-induced glycosylation of Rho-GTPases in host cells as the most likely mode of action. REC-3964 has negligible off-target activity, does not target the host’s glucosyltransferases, produces favorable gut and plasma exposure levels following oral dosing, and is non-mutagenic. Further, in an in vivo hamster model of C.Difficile infection, treatment with REC-3964 significantly prolonged the survival of animals relative to vehicle-treated controls.
Figure 64. REC-3964 blocks C. difficile Toxin B-mediated endothelial barrier disruption. Transendothelial resistance was quantified with ECIS after incubation of HUVEC cells with 10ng/mL TcdB from C. difficile in the presence of REC-3964. Barrier resistance is shown on a normalized scale with 0% representing the resistance in the absence of REC-3964, and 100% representing the resistance of healthy monolayers that were not exposed to toxin B. Data are presented as Mean ± SEM, N≥3 independent experiments.
Figure 65. C. difficile-infected model hamsters treated with REC-3964 survive longer than vehicle-treated animals. REC-3964 was administered by oral gavage twice daily for 5 consecutive days along with groups for vehicle and vancomycin (50 mg/kg, QD). N=5 in untreated and vancomycin-treated animals and N=10 in vehicle and test-compound treated animals. 
Figure 66. REC-3964 selectively inhibits the toxin’s innate UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase. (A) Autocatalytic event releases C. difficile toxin’s glucosyltransferase enzymatic domain into the infected cell, which locks Rho family GTPases in the inactive state. Inactivation of Rho GTPases alters cytoskeletal dynamics, induces apoptosis and impairs barrier function which drives the pathological effects of C. difficile infection.

We further optimized these molecules to generate lead molecules with oral bioavailability that are capable of sensitizing homologous recombination-proficient (HRP) ovarian tumors to PARP inhibitors. There are approximately 13,000 cases per year of HR-proficient ovarian cancers in the US and EU5. While PARP inhibitors have significantly improved outcomes for patients with HR-deficient tumors, patients with HR-proficient tumors are either not eligible for certain PARP-targeted therapies, or have significantly worse response rates. There are currently no approved therapies that sensitize HR-proficient tumors to PARP inhibitors. This program anticipates reaching IND-enabling studies in 2023.
Disease Overview
Ovarian cancer carries a particularly poor prognosis as most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Mutations in genes involved in the DNA Damage Repair pathway, including BRCA1/2, are identified in up to 50% of ovarian cancer patients. PARP inhibitors, including olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib, were developed to exploit the resulting susceptibility to additional genomic damage in tumors harboring these mutations. Outcome for ovarian cancer patients with HR-deficient tumors have improved approximately twofold, with even better survival data observed in patients with BRCA1/2 mutant tumors; however, patients with HR-proficient tumors have not similarly benefited from PARP inhibition; these patients often have poorer prognoses and unfavorable outcomes. 
Insight from Recursion OS
CDK12 is a critical transcriptional CDK that regulates the expression of genes involved in the DNA Damage Response (DDR). Inhibiting CDK12 sensitizes cancer cells to DDR agents such as PARP inhibitors. Additionally, genome-wide studies suggest that CDK12 deficiency may predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in the clinic. As a result CDK12 has been identified as a therapeutic target that can induce synthetic lethality in both HR-deficient and HR-proficient cancers. Discovery of selective CDK12 inhibitors has been challenging as CDK12 and CDK13 share conserved kinase domains. Inhibiting CDK13 may lead to toxicities based on human genetic evidence studies, making combinations difficult to tolerate. Despite reports of functional redundancy, we observed that genetic knockout of CDK12 could be clearly distinguished phenotypically from that of CDK13. We leveraged this insight from the Recursion OS to identify RBM39 as an alternative target that selectively mimics CDK12 loss, but not CDK13, providing a novel approach for targeting CDK12 biology while mitigating toxicities due to CDK13. We subsequently discovered REC-65029 as closely mimicking the phenotypic loss of CDK12 and RBM39, but not CDK13.
Figure 67: Inferred map relationships between CDK12, CDK13, RBM39 and REC-65029. Map representation demonstrating a high degree of phenotypic similarity between CDK12, RBM39 and multiple concentrations of REC-65029. CDK13 shows little or no functional similarity to CDK12, RBM39 or any concentration of REC-65029.
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules that drive de novo sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in HR-proficient tumors. CDK12 inhibition has been proposed as a mechanism to drive sensitivity to PARP in this setting, but the high homology of CDKs makes targeting a single homolog difficult and prone to off-target toxicity. Mimicking the effects of CDK12 inhibition via alternative novel targets could be a route to increase the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors in HR-proficient tumors. We intend to position this agent in combination with PARP inhibitors in HR-proficient ovarian cancer, and potentially explore single agent activity. 
Preclinical
In 2022, we evaluated a Recursion-generated NCE molecule REC-1170204 with high phenotypic similarity to REC-65029, the initial small molecule discovered for this program. In vivo efficacy studies evaluated single agent and combination activity with niraparib in OV0273, an ovarian HR-proficient patient derived xenograft (PDX) model. We observed statistically significant responses in both single agent REC-1170204 and combination vs either Niraparib or vehicle arms. We also saw significant survival for animals treated with REC-1170204 alone or in combination with Niraparib at >30 days post final dose. We have identified a lead series and are advancing lead molecules into pilot (rodent and non-rodent species) safety studies while pursuing back-up molecules.

(40 mg/kg, QD, PO) for 32 days. Single agent REC-1170204 or in combination with Niraparib resulted in a statistically significant response vs either Niraparib or vehicle arms. In addition, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival > 30 days post final dose. *p<0.05, ** p<0.01, **** p<0.0001.
Enhancing Anti-PD-(L)1 Response by Inhibiting Novel Targets (Target Alpha) - Late Discovery
We identified a lead series using our inferential-search approach that is capable of amplifying the response to checkpoint therapy in vivo. A therapy that enhances anti-PD-(L)1 effect has the potential to increase the response rate in anti-PD-(L)1-eligible patients or expand the eligibility criteria of patients not expected to respond to immune checkpoint therapy. Additional priming of tumors can have a significant benefit, as response rates in checkpoint-eligible settings is approximately 12-15%. Furthermore, many tumor types have proven intractable for immunotherapy and could greatly benefit from this approach. Although there are several approved combinations with anti-PD-(L)1, the vast majority of these are combinations with other checkpoint antibodies. These combinations frequently lead to an increase in the presence of immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), thereby causing treatment discontinuation and hindering the overall patient benefit. This program anticipates reaching IND-enabling studies in 2023.
Disease Overview
Anti-PD-(L)1 therapies have significantly changed the landscape of cancer therapy over the past ten years. In eligible patients, overall survival has nearly doubled for certain tumors and serious adverse events have nearly halved compared to historical chemotherapies. Despite the use of biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB) status, low response rates persist in many checkpoint-eligible settings. Furthermore, next generation checkpoints such as LAG-3 and TIGIT, or strategies to promote secondary immune activation (e.g., STING or dual checkpoint) focus primarily on addressing these efficacy limitations. Yet these newer agents have been shown to amplify IRAEs, leading to treatment reductions and discontinuations. An agent that increases sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy without concomitant increases in peripheral inflammation could enhance response rates in under-responsive tumor types and lead to more durable clinical benefits for patients.
Insight from Recursion OS
We mapped 110 genes identified as causal markers of response or resistance to immunotherapy derived from in vivo pooled CRISPR genetic screens in mice. We discovered an interesting novel relationship between BIRC2, other BIRC2 family genes and Gene A, a known modulator of inflammation and a counterintuitive target for enhancing immunotherapy response. We used the Recursion OS to identify both an annotated inhibitor of Gene A, REC-648918, and a second gene, Gene B as a second target of REC-648918, which was independently uncovered as a potential immunotherapy resistance marker. 
Figure 69: Inferred map relationships supporting initiation of Target Alpha. (A) Map representation of 110 causal markers of response or resistance to immunotherapy identified from in vivo pooled CRISPR screens in mice. 
(B) Cluster of genes including BIRC2, BIRC2 family genes and Gene A, an druggable gene with unexpected clustering in this group. Map relationship between Gene A, an annotated Gene A inhibitor and Gene B. 
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop novel, orally bioavailable small molecules that drive sensitivity to immune checkpoint therapies. We identified an agent that potentiates anti-PD-1 tumor efficacy while decreasing peripheral inflammation compared to anti-PD-(L)1 alone that could both enhance response rates in under-responsive tumor types and decrease IRAEs, likely leading to more durable clinical benefits for patients. We intend to position this therapeutic in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 in both checkpoint-eligible and checkpoint-resistant patients.
Preclinical
In June 2022, we characterized a novel chemical entity, REC-1170035, with significantly increased potency from the original compound, REC-648918. In vivo efficacy was improved in the CT26 tumor model from 40% to 60% complete responses in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, and all complete responders elicited immunological memory upon rechallenge. REC-1170035 in combination with anti-PD-1 caused significant recruitment of CD45+ cells into the tumor microenvironment, while significantly attenuating the percentage of immunosuppressive, alternatively activated (M2) macrophages and percentage of exhausted, LAG3+, CD8+ T cells. While REC-1170035 maintained local anti-tumor inflammation, the levels of IFNγ and CXCL10 were significantly reduced in the blood as compared to anti-PD-1 therapy alone. Additional chemical optimization efforts for this program have focused on improving human dose projection and pharmacokinetic properties.

Potentiator of Anti-PD-(L)1 in High TMB Cancers (Target Delta) - Preclinical
We have identified a novel use for a clinical-stage, orally bioavailable small molecule to improve sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and additional tumors harboring high TMB including KRAS and p53 mutations. Each year over 150,000 high TMB patients are eligible for treatment in the US and EU5 Although many of these patients receive anti-PD-1 therapy, response rates are highly variable and the need for a chemotherapy-free regimen in the refractory setting remains high in this population. This program is currently in the dose-optimization phase.
Disease Overview
While anti-PD-1 therapy is approved for high TMB (greater than or equal to 10 muts/Mb), there is a significant degree of heterogeneity in responses, there remains a significant need for additional therapies to act as single agents or to potentiate the activity of currently approved immunotherapies.
Insight from Recursion OS
Certain loss of function (LoF) mutations in cancer are known to drive immune checkpoint resistance. We hypothesized that agonizing the same targets in a wildtype setting may work to further augment immune sensitivity and response to checkpoint inhibitors. We searched the Recursion OS to identify small molecules that act phenotypically opposite to several loss of function genes and identified Gene A and the compound REC-64151, which is strongly phenotypically opposite to Gene A. On the basis of this inference, we advanced REC-64151 into a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) model to determine if it would potentiate the response to anti-PD-1. 
Figure 71: Inferred map relationships between Gene A and REC-64151. Map representation demonstrating a high degree of phenotypic opposite between Gene A and REC-64151 at multiple concentrations.
Product Concept
We aim to discover and develop orally bioavailable, small molecule therapeutics that potentiate immunotherapies. We intend to position these therapeutics in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 and other targeted therapies in metastatic NSCLC and other populations with high tumor mutation burden. 
Preclinical
We capitalized on our inferential-search approach to identify small molecules that show pheno-opposite relationships to LoF mutations in cancer known to drive immune checkpoint resistance. In Q4 2022, we showed that REC-64151 potentiates anti-PD-1 in a NSCLC model compared to anti-PD-1 alone. All complete responders elicited immunological memory upon rechallenge. We are currently evaluating several molecules with similar mechanisms of action in in vivo efficacy and tolerability studies.
Figure 72. REC-64151 potentiates anti-PD-1 in a high TMB NSCLC model. (A) KP-3M tumor cells were injected into the subcutaneous right flank of mice, allowed to size match and then treated for 25d with either vehicle, anti-PD-1 (10 mg/kg/day BIW), REC-64151 (150 mg/kg/day QD), anti-PD-1 + REC-64151 (at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day QD). Tumor volumes are represented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis performed using mixed-effects two way ANOVA and Tukey’s post test against aPD1 alone, **p<0.01, ****p<0.0001, ***p<0.001. (B) When re-challenged with KP-3M tumor cells on the left flank, all mice that achieved CR rejected re-implantation. Statistical analysis performed using two way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey’s post test against naive age-matched controls, ****p<0.0001.
Partnerships
We have and in the future may collaborate with third parties to broadly explore diverse disease domains (such as fibrosis, neuroscience, oncology, immunology and inflammation) in order to identify novel target insights and potential therapeutics that may include small molecules, large molecules, gene therapies and cell therapies. We may also explore a communal asset-type strategy where we license search results from our phenomaps to partners. 
The goal of every partnership is to create therapeutics, yet the approach may take multiple forms:
•Novel Therapeutics. Without any presumptive target hypothesis, we can identify differentiated therapeutics by rapidly evaluating large compound libraries within our maps of human cellular biology.
•Novel Targets. By profiling diverse biological perturbations (such as genetic factors) on our platform, we may be able to identify novel druggable targets that we can then exploit with partners to generate therapeutic candidates.
Roche & Genentech Collaboration and License Agreement 
On December 5, 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, pursuant to which we will construct, using our imaging technology and proprietary machine learning algorithms, unique maps of the inferred relationships amongst perturbation phenotypes in a given cellular context and together with Roche and Genentech will create multi-modal models and maps to further expand and refine such inferred relationships, in both cases with the goal to discover and develop therapeutic small molecule programs in a gastrointestinal cancer indication and in key areas of neuroscience. 
Upfront Payment. In January 2022, Roche paid us an upfront cash payment of $150.0 million.
Phenomap Creation, Acceptance and Access. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for creating a certain number of phenomaps in each of the Exclusive Fields. We will also provide Roche with limited access to our pre-existing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) phenomap. Roche will have specified rights to query or access the phenomaps to generate novel inferences that may lead to the discovery or development of therapeutic products.
Phenomap-Related Options. Each of the phenomaps requested by Roche and created by Recursion may be subject to either an initiation fee, acceptance fee or both. Such fees could exceed $250.0 million for sixteen (16) accepted phenomaps. In addition, for a period of time after Roche’s acceptance of certain phenomaps, Roche will have the option to obtain, subject to payment of an exercise fee, rights to use outside the collaboration the raw images generated in the course of creating those phenomaps. If Roche exercises its External Use Option for all twelve (12) eligible phenomaps, Roche’s associated exercise fee payments to Recursion could exceed $250.0 million.
Collaboration Programs and Roche Options. Roche and Recursion will collaborate to select certain novel inferences with respect to small molecules or targets generated from the phenomaps for further validation and optimization as collaboration programs. Roche and Recursion may also combine sequencing datasets from Roche with Recursion’s phenomaps and collaborate to generate new algorithms to produce multi-modal maps from which additional collaboration programs may be initiated. For every collaboration program that successfully identifies potential therapeutic small molecules or validates a target, Roche will have an option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize such potential therapeutic small molecules or to exploit such target in the applicable Exclusive Field.
Payments if Roche Exercises Option for a Collaboration Program. Under the collaboration, Roche may initiate up to forty (40) small molecule collaboration programs. Each small molecule collaboration program, if optioned and successfully developed and commercialized by Roche, could yield more than $300.0 million in research, development, commercialization and net sales milestones for Recursion, as well as mid- to high-single digit tiered royalties on net sales. Recursion is also eligible for research, development, commercialization and net sales milestones for target collaboration programs optioned by Roche.
Recursion Programs. If Roche does not exercise its options in the Collaboration Agreement for certain collaboration programs, we may, with Roche’s prior consent, choose to independently validate, develop and commercialize products in a limited number of such programs, subject to agreed milestones and royalties to Roche. Roche will have rights to obtain an exclusive license to exploit such products by providing notice and paying us an opt-in fee and economics exceeding those that would otherwise be applicable if Roche had exercised its option for such program.
Exclusivity. During an agreed period of time after the Collaboration Agreement’s effective date, we are subject to certain exclusivities that limit our ability to conduct certain research and development activities with respect to compounds and targets in the Exclusive Fields, other than pursuant to the collaboration with Roche. However, we may continue pursuing products that we are researching and developing in the Exclusive Fields as of the effective date of the Collaboration Agreement.
Termination. The Collaboration Agreement includes standard termination provisions, including for material breach or insolvency and for Roche’s convenience. Certain of these termination rights can be exercised with respect to a particular Exclusive Field or exclusive license, as well as with respect to the entire Collaboration Agreement.
Figure 73. Under our collaboration with Roche & Genentech, we are creating multimodal maps of cellular biology to elucidate novel targets and starting points.
Bayer AG Research Collaboration and Option Agreement
In August 2020, we entered into a Research Collaboration and Option Agreement, or the Bayer Agreement, with Bayer AG, or Bayer. The Bayer Agreement was subsequently amended in December 2021 to incorporate usage of our biological mapping and navigating tools (inferential search). This agreement has a five-year term pursuant to which we and Bayer may initiate more than a dozen projects related to fibrosis across multiple organ systems, including lung, liver and heart. Under the agreement, we contributed approximately 190,000 compounds from our proprietary library and Bayer contributed approximately 500,000 compounds from its proprietary library and will contribute scientific expertise throughout the collaboration. During the five-year term of the Bayer Agreement, we are prohibited from conducting certain research and development activities in the field of fibrosis outside of the collaboration, either by ourselves or together with third parties.
We received an upfront technology access fee of $30.0 million in September 2020 as part of the Bayer Agreement. Under each research project, we will work with Bayer to identify potential candidates for development. Under the agreement, Bayer has the first option for licenses to potential candidates; each such license could potentially result in option exercise fees and development and commercial milestones paid to us with an aggregate value of up to approximately $100.0 million (for an option on a lead series) or up to approximately $120.0 million (for an option on a development candidate), as well as tiered royalties for each such license, ranging from low- to mid-single-digit percentages of sales, depending on commercial success. Royalty periods for each license are on a country-by-country basis, and the duration of each such period is tied to the duration of patent or regulatory exclusivity in each country (with a minimum term of 10 years each).
If Bayer does not exercise its option with respect to a development candidate or otherwise discontinues a research project prior to completion, within a specified period of time, we may exercise an option to negotiate with Bayer in good faith to obtain an exclusive license under Bayer’s interest in any lead series or development candidate developed pursuant to the research project and backup compounds related to thereto, as well as a non-exclusive license under Bayer’s background intellectual property necessary for our use of the project results related to such compounds.
Bayer may terminate the collaboration at any time without cause. Either party may terminate the agreement for a material breach by the other party. The term of each lead series or development candidate license agreement continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of (a) the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, (b) the expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity period for such product in such country and (c) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Bayer may terminate each such license agreement at any time without cause. Either party may terminate each such license agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. As of this prospectus, we have not entered into any lead series or development candidate license agreements with Bayer.
Figure 74. Multiple programs are advancing simultaneously in parallel to near-term milestones in the Bayer collaboration. Brute force programs commenced early in the partnership are making substantial progress, while the transition to inferential search accelerated new program initiation in 2022.
People and Culture
Essential to leading and defining TechBio is our growing team of approximately 500 Recursionauts, balanced between life scientists such as chemists and biologists (approximately 40% of employees) and computational and technical experts such as data scientists and software engineers (approximately 35% of employees). This kind of functional balance intentionally stands in contrast to traditional biotechnology companies. Together our team creates an environment where empirical data, statistical rigor and creative thinking is brought to bear on the problems we address. While we are united in a common mission, Decoding Biology to Radically Improve Lives, our greatest strength lies in our differences: expertise, gender, race, disciplines, experience and perspectives. Deliberately building and cultivating this culture is critical to achieving our audacious goals. 
Figure 75. Breakdown of Recursion’s approximately 500 employees across life sciences, technology and strategic operations. 
One of the most critical elements supporting Recursion’s leadership in TechBio is what we call the Recursion Mindset– a deep belief and commitment to industrialization through automation, systems-thinking, algorithms and data to deliver our mission. Broadly at the company we apply this mindset to eliminate toil and inefficiency creating space for our creative energy to be pointed at Recursion’s hardest problems. The Recursion Mindset is made manifest through our Founding Principles and supported by our Culture and Values. Our Founding Principles are the guideposts to our approach to technical and scientific decision-making. Our Values are the core behaviors that define our Culture and are the simplest definition of how we will achieve our mission. Combined they are the shape of our culture and guide us to reimagine how medicines are made on the path to delivering our mission. 
Figure 76. Recursion’s Founding Principles. These six founding principles differentiate our approach from nearly every other biopharma company, enable us to lead TechBio and form the foundation for a mindset we teach and enrich for at Recursion.
Figure 77. Recursion’s Values. These five values support our founding principles and guide our culture at Recursion.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
At Recursion, we believe in the moral and business case for diversity. The research-based evidence is unequivocal that diverse perspectives support better complex decision-making, foster greater innovation and ultimately result in greater company performance and success. We seek the best talent by maximizing diversity at the top of the recruiting funnel and then mitigating bias through objective decision-making throughout the hiring process. We foster an environment of inclusion for candidates and employees to unleash the strength of our differences. Lastly, acknowledging the breadth of societal injustice and inequities we pursue fair and equitable outcomes across all people-decisions through process design and supported by analytics.
Employee Recruitment, Development and Training
We take a design-thinking approach to building the employee experience at Recursion. It is a fit-for-purpose system that finds, grows and retains top talent to deliver our mission. Our people are mission-driven, humble, bright, generous of spirit and constructively dissatisfied with the status quo. We employ a targeted approach to identify, attract and hire diverse employees across highly-technical scientific disciplines including: biology, chemistry, data science, machine learning, engineering, robotics, clinical development and more. We seek people that are a fit for our commitment to industrialization as defined by our Recursion Mindset, which is manifested in our Founding Principles and Values.
Culturally, we instill an expectation to be constantly learning and teaching in pursuit of growing ourselves as fast as Recursion. Most notable is a 2-day experience offered year-round to all employees called Decoding Recursion. It is an opportunity for close interaction with senior leaders who teach the Recursion Mindset through stories. The need to learn is reinforced throughout our performance system which creates accountability for our learning, delivery and impact on others.
People stay at Recursion because of the opportunity to impact the world and grow in a place where they feel challenged, supported and connected. Throughout the employee experience we create moments, rituals, programs and spaces that inspire ambition, reward contributions and growth and foster belonging. 
Employee Health and Safety
We have dedicated Standard Operating Procedures to manage occupational health and safety, safety training and injury and illness and incident reporting. Every employee is responsible to ensure these procedures and policies are followed. We offer extensive training to ensure understanding and compliance. Compliance is mandatory for all laboratory employees per requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard on Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories.

Right panel: Our Toronto office is Recursion’s first major expansion project outside of the United States. This site, along with the Mila Montreal office, will serve as multidisciplinary hubs across data science and machine learning. 
Digital Vivarium. We lease a property that serves as a rodent vivarium. This lease expires in May 2028. We use this facility to conduct drug-discovery enabling pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and exploratory safety studies. The facility is equipped with proprietary, digitally-enabled cage technology. 
Corporate Social Responsibility
We believe that to achieve our mission, we must act like the company we aim to be, which means we must be a good corporate citizen. In recognition of our commitment to excellence in environment, social and governance, Recursion received a Prime Rating in 2022 for ESG performance from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The ISS ESG Corporate Rating provides an assessment of a company's environmental, social and governance activity. A Prime Rating is awarded to companies with ESG performance above a sector-specific threshold and is defined by ISS as "absolute best in class". Additionally, as of October 2022, Recursion was ranked 98 out of over 850 companies (approximately top 10%) in the pharmaceutical category by Morningstar Sustainalytics23 which gives an in-depth analysis of a company’s ESG performance and compares it to industry peers.
To date, we have focused our community efforts in areas of impact that are aligned with our Values and our strengths, including: (i) diversity, equity and inclusion in technology and biotechnology (e.g., the Recursion Foundation has partnered with the University of Utah to sponsor Altitude Lab, a life science incubator and accelerator for diverse health care entrepreneurs); (ii) the growth and sustainability of our local life science and technology ecosystems (e.g., Recursion is a founding member of BioHive, a Utah life science collective); and (iii) the promotion of sustainable environmental practices. We believe that through these principles of community engagement, we can extend our mission of radically improving lives to those in our communities.

We currently utilize contract development and manufacturing organizations to produce drug substance and investigational drug product in support of the assets within our pipeline. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product for our drug candidates from third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our drug candidates on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. 
Strategic Agreements 
In order to achieve our mission, we partner with leading biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions to identify novel therapeutics and unlock biological insights using our discovery technology. Our partnering efforts take two primary forms: i) Discovery Platform Partnerships and ii) Asset-Based Collaborations.
Asset-Based Collaborations
In addition to NCEs, the Recursion OS may discover new uses for known chemical entities owned or controlled by third parties. In such circumstances, we may license rights to these assets in order to advance these programs internally. Following are four such enabling licensing agreements underlying our four clinical stage programs.
REC-994: University of Utah Research Foundation Agreements
In February 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with the University of Utah Research Foundation, or UURF, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license under certain patents and a non-exclusive license under certain know-how, in each case controlled by UURF and related to the drug tempol, or REC-994, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and distribute products incorporating REC-994 worldwide for the treatment of cerebral cavernous malformation, or CCM. In partial consideration for the license rights, we issued UURF equity in our company. In addition, we agreed to reimburse UURF for a specified portion of costs associated with the filing, maintenance and prosecution of the licensed patent rights. The Amended and Restated License Agreement will expire on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent within the patent rights in the applicable country. UURF may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach, if we cease commercially diligent efforts to develop or commercialize a licensed product or service, or our bankruptcy or insolvency.
REC-2282: Ohio State Innovation Foundation In-License
In December 2018, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the Ohio State Innovation Foundation, or OSIF, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and fully-paid up, royalty-free, nonexclusive license under certain know-how, in each case controlled by OSIF and related to the pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor, OSU-HDAC42, or REC-2282, to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import products incorporating OSU-HDAC42 worldwide. OSIF also assigned certain assets to us, relating to the pharmaceutical composition known as AR-42. OSIF retains the right to use and allow other academic, nonprofit and government institutions to use the licensed intellectual property for research, non-commercial and educational purposes. OSIF shall not practice, have practiced, or transfer such reserved rights for any clinical purpose other than completion of the existing clinical trials at the time of the license agreement without our prior written consent. We are developing REC-2282 for the treatment of NF2 and are evaluating the utility of the compound in additional disease states using our platform.
Pursuant to the agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize licensed products and are required to meet certain diligence milestones within two years following the execution of the agreement, including the initiation of clinical trials. The license agreement is also limited by and made subject to certain rights and regulations of the government, including the Bayh-Dole Act.
In consideration for the license, we paid OSIF an upfront payment of $2.0 million dollars and are obligated to pay OSIF certain milestones, totaling up to $20.0 million dollars, as well as mid-single digit royalties on net sales of the licensed products. In addition, we owe 25% of any non-royalty sublicensing consideration prior to a Phase II clinical trial or 15% of such sublicensing consideration after initiation of a Phase II clinical trial, provided that milestone payments are creditable against these sublicensing fees. In 2022 we paid OSIF $1.0 million dollars upon dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 study of REC-2282 for the treatment of NF2. 
The agreement expires on the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patents. We may terminate this agreement on 90 days prior written notice to OSIF. Either party may terminate the agreement on 60 days prior written notice for an uncured, material breach by the other party, or bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party.
REC-3599: Chromaderm License Agreement
In December 2019, we entered into a License Agreement with Chromaderm, Inc., or Chromaderm, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain know-how and future patents that may arise controlled by Chromaderm to develop, manufacture and commercialize products containing ruboxistaurin, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, in non-topical formulations for all uses other than the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of skin hyperpigmentation conditions or disorders. Chromaderm obtained an exclusive license from Eli Lilly to certain intellectual property necessary for the development, commercialization and manufacture of ruboxistaurin and has developed certain additional intellectual property. Chromaderm reserved the right to use the licensed intellectual property to fulfill its obligations under supply and manufacturing agreements with us, and both Chromaderm and Eli Lilly reserved rights to use the licensed intellectual property to fulfill obligations under existing agreements and in the case of Eli Lilly for internal research. In Q4 2022, we announced that we had discontinued development of ruboxistaurin, or REC-3599, in GM2; however, we continue to evaluate the compound as a potential medicine for various other indications. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in the territory in accordance with a specified development plan as may be modified by us at any time in our sole discretion. Under the agreement, we are prohibited from developing, manufacturing, or commercializing licensed products for the treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of skin hyperpigmentation conditions or disorders.
Under the agreement, we paid Chromaderm an upfront payment of $1.3 million. We are obligated to pay Chromaderm certain development milestones with respect to the licensed products, totaling up to $35.5 million for a first indication, up to $52.5 million if multiple indications are pursued, and certain commercial milestones totaling up to $49 million. Finally, we will owe Chromaderm mid-single-digit to low-double-digit tiered royalties on net sales of REC-3599. As of the date of this filing, we have not made any milestone or royalty payments to Chromaderm.
The agreement will expire, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, a country-by-country basis upon the later of (a) the last to expire of the licensed patents applicable to the development, manufacture or commercialization of a licensed product in such country, (b) ten years from the first commercial sale of licensed product in such country, or (c) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity of such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the agreement on 90 days prior written notice to Chromaderm. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 45 days prior written notice (15 days for payment breaches) for an uncured, material breach by the other party.
REC-4881: Takeda License Agreement
In May 2020, we entered into a License Agreement, or the Takeda In-License, with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive (even as to Takeda and its affiliates), worldwide, sublicensable under certain conditions, transferable, royalty-bearing license to certain Takeda patents, know-how and materials related to develop, manufacture and commercialize Takeda’s clinical-stage compound known as TAK-733, a non-ATP-competitive allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, subject to a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, fully paid up, license back to Takeda to use the licensed compounds for non-clinical research purposes. We are currently developing the compound REC-4881 for the treatment of FAP, and patients with spontaneous APC-mutant tumors. We are also evaluating the utility of the compound in additional disease states using our platform.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in each of (a) the US, (b) at least three of the following European countries: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and (c) Japan.
Upon execution of the agreement, we paid an upfront fee of $1.5 million to Takeda. Under the Takeda In-License, we are obligated to pay Takeda milestones amounts totaling up to $39.5 million upon achievement of specified development and regulatory milestone events. In addition, we are obligated to pay Takeda low-to-mid single-digit royalties based on net sales of products containing the licensed compounds by us, our affiliates or sublicensees, subject to specified reductions. Our obligation to pay royalties continues on a country-by-country basis until the latest of expiration of the last to expire patent licensed by Takeda that covers the product, expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period for the product and ten years after the first commercial sale of the product, in such country. As of the date of this filing, we have not made any milestone or royalty payments to Takeda.
Each party has the right to terminate the license agreement for the other party’s material uncured breach, insolvency or bankruptcy. In addition, we may terminate the agreement without cause any time after May 2023, and Takeda may terminate the agreement if we have not conducted any material activities in support of the development or commercialization of the licensed compounds or any product containing a licensed compound and have not demonstrated that we used commercially reasonable efforts towards the development of such compounds or products for a period of 12 consecutive months and such failure is not due to events beyond our reasonable control. Further, Takeda may terminate the license agreement if we challenge the validity or enforceability of a licensed patent. Upon termination for any reason other than for Takeda’s breach of the license agreement, upon Takeda’s request we are obligated to negotiate in good faith, for a period of 120 days, terms and conditions of a license to Takeda under certain technology developed by us during the term of the agreement for the purpose of developing, commercializing and otherwise exploiting the licensed compounds and products containing the licensed compounds.
Competition
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company utilizing advanced technologies across biology, chemistry, automation and computer science to discover and design therapeutics at unprecedented scale and efficiency. Our efforts to date have resulted in an expansive pipeline of differentiated programs in early discovery and preclinical development and four clinical-stage programs as well as an intellectual property portfolio comprising patents, trademarks, software and trade secrets. We believe that our differentiated approach to technology-enabled drug discovery, a combination of both wet lab and computational approaches embodied by the Recursion OS, provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
We are a hybrid company, comprising the best elements of technology-enabled drug discovery companies, scalable platform companies and traditional biopharma companies. As such, we compete within multiple categories of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries where companies are similarly working to integrate rapidly advancing technologies into their drug discovery and development activities and/or are creating scalable scientific platforms with the potential to generate large therapeutic pipelines and where other companies are developing therapies targeting indications we are or may choose to pursue. While we believe we have the competitive advantages referred to above, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, consortiums and public and private research institutions, among others, many of whom have significantly greater resources than us. Notable competitors include:
•Technology-Enabled Drug Discovery Companies. Such companies apply computational tools to unlock novel insights or accelerate drug discovery and development across different points in the value chain. Representative examples include Relay Therapeutics, Exscientia, Schrodinger, AbCellera and Insitro.
•Scalable Platform Companies. Such companies are applying novel scientific approaches or engineering novel therapeutic modalities with the potential to seed large numbers of therapeutic candidates. These companies may compete directly with our pipeline of predominantly small molecule therapeutics. Representative companies include Moderna, BioNTech and CureVac.
•Traditional Biopharma Companies. Such companies, while primarily engaged in late-stage clinical development and product commercialization, are increasingly making their own investments in the application of ML and advanced computational tools across the drug discovery and development value 
chain. Such investments may include partnerships with other biotechnology companies (including Recursion) from which we may benefit. Representative companies include Novartis, Janssen (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Merck and Pfizer.
•Large Technology Companies. Large technology companies constantly seek growth opportunities. Technology-enabled drug discovery may represent a compelling opportunity for these companies, some of which have research groups or subsidiaries focused on drug discovery and others of which have signed large technology partnerships with biopharma companies. Representative companies include Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property focus is the industrialization of phenomics, a new class of -omics data, and have applied industry knowledge to date to continue to build out and expand a variety of other cutting-edge technologies. Further, we have generated algorithmic, software and statistical insights in the course of our work. Within the burgeoning field of technology-enabled drug discovery, we seek to protect our innovations, with a combination of patents and trade secrets and for each novel technology or improvement we develop, we consider the appropriate course of intellectual property protection.
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for drug candidates and any of our future drug candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know how; to operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
We believe in the benefits of open-source science and that open-source data sharing drives value for us and society as a whole. For example, we have published certain key findings and datasets derived from our platform around COVID-19 under terms designed to allow anyone to make use of the data, in the hope that the data would be useful in fighting the global pandemic. We have also released some of the largest open-sourced biological datasets in the world under terms that allow for broad academic and non-commercial use.
Patents
As of February 2023, Recursion has a number of issued patents and pending applications in the US and over 75 foreign jurisdictions. These filings are from over 90 different patent families, covering all aspects of our business, including Platform IP and Program IP.
•Recursion Platform IP: The Recursion Platform IP encompasses the Recursion OS IP, as well as many other inventions related to cell perturbations, gene editing, cell manufacturing and hardware solutions. We also pursue a strategy of seeking patent protection on smaller discrete inventions throughout the breadth of our pipeline, ranging from experiment design, operations within our labs, data collection and analysis (including deep learning insights). We have 23 distinct patent families related to our Recursion Platform, with patents expiring as late as 2044. 
•InVivomics: Additionally, through our acquisition of Vium, we obtained a collection of active patent families related to InVivomics, including 39 issued U.S. patents covering cage design, data collection and data analysis, 19 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 1 pending U.S. design application. Our patents related to our InVivomics generally expire between 2035 and 2040. 
•Recursion Program IP: A breakdown of our Program IP portfolio is below: 
◦REC-2282: We exclusively license patents and patent applications related to REC-2282 from OSIF; this patent estate includes composition of matter IP for REC-2282. Our licensed patents related to REC-2282 generally expire between 2027 and 2038, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension. 
◦REC-994: We exclusively license patents in connection with our REC-994 product candidate from UURF; this patent estate is targeted at the use of REC-994 for the treatment of CCM. Our licensed patents related to REC-994 generally expire between 2035 and 2036, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. would run seven years from marketing authorization. 
◦REC-4881: We exclusively license patents and patent applications in connection with our REC-4881 product candidate from Takeda; this patent estate includes composition of matter IP for REC-4881. Our licensed patents related to REC-4881 generally expire between 2027 and 2032, excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension. Orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. for FAP would run seven years from marketing authorization. 
◦REC-3964: This program was generated internally and has pending patent applications that would expire in 2042 excluding any patent term adjustment or patent term extension.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of biotechnology has emerged in the United States and in Europe, among other countries. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing, or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and drug candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s drug candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, which may prevent us from commercializing our drug candidates and future drug candidates and practicing our proprietary technology.
Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or drug candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our drug candidates, future drug candidates and platforms. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with complete protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that achieve similar outcomes but with different approaches. For these reasons, we may have competition for our drug candidates. Moreover, the time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of our candidate products may shorten the length of effective patent protection following commercialization. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and drug candidates, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our products or processes or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Some of our pending patent applications in the United States are provisional patent applications. Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely 
file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a nonprovisional patent application related to the patent. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. A U.S. patent also may be accorded patent term adjustment, or PTA, under certain circumstances to compensate for delays in obtaining the patent from the USPTO. In some instances, such a PTA may result in a U.S. patent term extending beyond 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application related to the U.S. patent. In addition, in the United States, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process.
Trademarks
As of January 2023, our trademark portfolio comprises more than 70 registered trademarks or active trademark applications worldwide, among which we have issued trademarks in the U.S. for “Recursion” and “Recursion Pharmaceuticals.”
Trade Secrets
In addition to our reliance on patent protection for our inventions, drug candidates and programs, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, some elements of manufacturing processes, proprietary assays, analytics techniques and processes, knowledge gained through clinical experience such as approaches to dosing and administration and management of patients, as well as computational-biological algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, advisors and consultants, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. As a result, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the party’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived of by the individual during the course of employment, and which relate to or are reasonably capable or being used in our current or planned business or research and development are our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against the misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. However, such agreements and policies may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the relevant regulatory authority. 
U.S. Drug Development 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
•Our drug candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice, or GLP; 
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
•submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
•potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing; 
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and

•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 
The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP and ICH 
regulations for safety/toxicology studies. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials, which are generally required for FDA approval of an NDA, to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development along with any subsequent changes to the investigational plan. Some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP and GMP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States. 
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
•Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information are collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
•Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. The sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our drug candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our drug candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life. 
NDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the United States for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. 
The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Orphan Drugs 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant an orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may 
not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designations do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
Post-approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. Manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, its manufacturer or the NDA holder, including recalls.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
•suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
•product seizure or detention; 
•refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
Safe and effective use of a therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product and if the manufacturer wishes to market or distribute such diagnostic for use as a companion diagnostic, then the FDA will require separate approval or clearance of the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic to the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, an unapproved or uncleared companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational medical device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. The sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical 
studies involving the investigational diagnostic device. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same clinical trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the clinical trial protocol, the investigational product(s), and subjects involved, a sponsor may seek to submit an IDE alone (e.g., if the drug has already been approved by FDA and is used consistent with its approved labeling), or both an IND and an IDE. 
Pursuing FDA approval/clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, or a de novo classification for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
510(k) clearance process 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process. 
De novo classification process 
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents a low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, may take several years and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data. 
PMA process 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance and GMP requirements. 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Among other requirements, medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved, device manufacturers must establish registration and device listings with the FDA and a medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA and the FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
•Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA (as defined below) provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;

•The federal criminal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Laws, and the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government and/or impose exclusions from federal health care programs and/or penalties for parties who engage in such prohibited conduct; 
•The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations also impose obligations on covered entities such as health insurance plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain health care providers and their respective business associates, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
•federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;
•the FD&C Act, which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require 
biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements. 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug, a method for using it, or a method of manufacturing it, is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents covering products eligible for patent term extension to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. We may seek patent term extension for any of our issued or licensed patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be 
submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
European Union Drug Development 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU. 
European Union Drug Review and Approval 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is composed of the 28 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations. 
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific, or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SOPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the 
assessment, SOPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates, or SPCs, serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. 
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical drug candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow the price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Healthcare Reform 
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must 
include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP and adding a rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. 
Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. 
On November 20, 2020, the HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) issued a final rule eliminating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plan sponsors, Medicaid managed care organizations, and those entities’ pharmacy benefit managers, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. OIG created two safe harbors for certain point-of-sale reductions in price on prescription pharmaceutical products and certain pharmacy benefit manager service fees. On December 2, 2020, OIG and CMS each issued a final rule that set forth modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, Civil Monetary Penalties Law and Physician Self-Referral Law (or the Stark Law) (respectively) regulations to remove regulatory barriers to value-based care arrangements. CMS’s final rule also clarifies and updates certain long-standing terms that appear throughout the Stark Law regulations.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and 
proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, the federal Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law on August 16, 2022, contains multiple provisions that could have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drug candidates if approved, as the statute includes provisions intended to reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare. In addition to the direct impact of the IRA on federal drug reimbursement, the statute may also lead to similar reductions in payments from private payers. Various members of the current U.S. Congress have indicated that lowering drug prices continues to be a legislative and political priority, and some have introduced other proposals aimed at drug pricing. Similarly, at the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
