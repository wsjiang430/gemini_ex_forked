ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Since our incorporation in 1949, our primary business has been the safe and reliable transportation of personnel to, from, and among offshore platforms for customers engaged in the oil and gas exploration, development, and production industry. Although in recent years we have entered several new domestic and international markets, a large portion of our offshore flight operations continues to be concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico, where we are a leading provider of such services. Since late 1997, we have also provided air medical transportation for hospitals and for emergency service agencies where we operate principally as an independent provider of medical services. In addition, we perform helicopter maintenance and repair services, primarily to existing customers that own their own aircraft. At December 31, 2018, we owned or operated 239 aircraft domestically and internationally, 125 of which were dedicated to our Oil and Gas segment, 108 of which were dedicated to our Air Medical segment, and 6 of which were dedicated to other operations.
Recent Developments
Chapter 11 Cases
On March 14, 2019 (the “Petition Date”), the Company and its four principal U.S. subsidiaries identified in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). The Debtors have requested joint administration of their Chapter 11 Cases under the caption In re: PHI, Inc., et al., Main Case No. 19-30923. The Debtors continue to operate their businesses and manage their properties as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
New Term Loan Agreement
On March 13, 2019, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement, dated the same date (the “Term Loan Agreement”), by and among the Company, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors party thereto, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Blue Torch Finance, LLC, as administrative agent and collateral agent, for a first lien term loan of $70 million (the “Term Loan”). Immediately upon entering into the Term Loan Agreement, and prior to the Petition Date (as defined below), the Company borrowed $70 million thereunder, the net proceeds of which (after the payment of transaction expenses and fees thereunder) are expected to be used to fund the working capital and liquidity requirements of the Company during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases (as defined below) and thereafter. The full principal amount of the Term Loan is due March 13, 2023. At the Company’s election, borrowings under the Term Loan will bear interest at either (x) the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus 6% or (y) the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) plus 5%. The Term Loan is secured by a first lien on 91 aircraft registered and located in Antarctica, Australia, Canada, and the United States (which are currently deployed primarily in the Company’s oil and gas and technical services operations), the related spare parts for such aircraft, and certain other non-working capital assets, as well as a second lien on all working capital assets (second in priority to the liens granted under the Loan Agreement, dated as of September 28, 2018, by and among Thirty Two, L.L.C., as lender, the Company, as borrower, and the guarantors party thereto (the “2018 Loan Agreement”)). The Term Loan Agreement contains customary pre-payment requirements. In addition, the Company has paid a funding fee, which is subject to forgiveness based on certain future events. 
Acceleration of Certain Debt Obligations
The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the obligations under the indenture governing our 5.25% Senior Notes due 2019 and our term loan agreement with Thirty Two, L.L.C. Any efforts to enforce such financial obligations under such debt instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders’ rights of enforcement in respect of such financial obligations are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, the obligations of the Term Loan did not accelerate upon the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases.
Notification of NASDAQ Delisting
On March 15, 2019, the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notified us that, as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and in accordance with applicable rules, Nasdaq has determined to delist the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq. The Company is

currently reviewing whether to appeal this determination. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, We anticipate that the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases could detrimentally affect the trading liquidity of our common stock.
Description of Operations
We operate in three business segments: Oil and Gas, Air Medical, and Technical Services. For financial information regarding our operating segments and the geographic areas in which they operate, see Note 14, Business Segments and Geographic Areas, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
Oil and Gas. Our Oil and Gas segment, headquartered in Lafayette, Louisiana, provides helicopter services primarily for the major integrated and independent oil and gas production companies transporting personnel and, to a lesser extent, parts and equipment to, from, and among offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and internationally. Our customers include Shell Oil Company, BP America Production Company, ExxonMobil Production Co., and ConocoPhillips Company, with each of whom we have worked for 35 or more years, and ENI Petroleum, with whom we have worked for more than 20 years.
At December 31, 2018, we operated 125 aircraft out of 16 base stations in this segment. Compared to December 31, 2017, this represented a decrease of 8 aircraft. For additional information on these properties, see Item 2 of this report.
Oil and gas exploration and production companies and other offshore oil service companies use our services primarily for routine transportation of personnel and equipment, to transport personnel during medical and safety emergencies, and to evacuate personnel during the threat of hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. Most of our customers have entered into fixed-term contracts with us, although some hire us on an “ad hoc” or “spot” basis.
We generally classify our helicopters as light (generally up to six passengers), medium (generally up to 12 passengers) or heavy (up to 19 passengers), each of which serves a different transportation need of offshore energy companies. Medium and heavy helicopters can fly in a wider variety of operating conditions, travel over longer distances and carry larger payloads than light helicopters. These aircraft are required for crew changes on the large offshore production facilities and drilling rigs in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico and internationally. Most of our Oil and Gas aircraft are available for hire by any customer, but some are dedicated to individual customers. Our helicopters have flight ranges up to 570 miles with a 30-minute fuel reserve and thus are capable of servicing many of the deepwater oil and gas operations from 50 to 200 miles offshore. (See Item 2 – Properties, for specific information by aircraft model.)
Our strategic focus in this segment of our business is on providing transport services to the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico and our international offshore markets. As of December 31, 2018, of the 125 aircraft dedicated to our Oil and Gas segment, 69 aircraft were classified as medium or heavy aircraft. Our strategy is to focus more of our business on deepwater operations because we believe they will provide a more stable and profitable source of revenue. Deepwater operations tend to have longer lead times and, consequently, activity levels are generally less susceptible to short term volatility in commodity prices as compared to other offshore operations. The capital commitments are also substantially larger than shallow water operations, and consequently, our client base is more heavily weighted to the major integrated and larger independent oil and gas companies. In addition, in recent years exploration and new production activities have tended to shift from the shallow water to the deepwater regions, and we expect that trend to continue. Finally, the majority of our transportation activity services oil and gas production facilities, which adds stability to our business as these facilities generally operate for longer periods than exploration facilities.
In 2011, we began to expand selectively into certain international markets and on December 29, 2017, we acquired the offshore helicopters services business formerly conducted in New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea (the “HNZ Offshore Business”) by HNZ Group Inc. (“HNZ”). For additional information on this acquisitions, see (i) Note 2 to the financial statements included under Item 8 of this report and (ii) the current report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on December 29, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had 11 aircraft in Australia, 7 aircraft in Canada, 5 aircraft in West Africa, 5 aircraft in the Middle East, 3 aircraft in Trinidad, 2 aircraft in each of New Zealand, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, available for our oil and gas operations. Our HNZ Offshore Business derives a small amount of revenue from search and rescue operations, which we include in our oil and gas segment operating results.
Operating revenue from our Oil and Gas segment is derived mainly from contracts that include a fixed monthly rate for a particular model of aircraft, plus variable payments based on the amount of flight time. Operating costs for the Oil and Gas segment are primarily aircraft operation costs, including costs for pilots and maintenance personnel. We typically operate under fixed-term contracts with our customers, a substantial portion of which are competitively bid. Our fixed-term contracts have terms generally of one to seven years, with payment in U.S. dollars. In 2018, approximately 86% of our oil and gas-related revenues were from fixed-term customer contracts, with approximately 59% of these revenues from the fixed fee component and 41% from the variable 
2

fee component. The remaining 14% of our 2018 oil and gas-related revenues were attributable to work in the spot market and ad hoc flights for contracted customers.
Most of our fixed-term contracts permit early termination by the customer, sometimes with as little as 30 days’ notice for any reason and generally without penalty. In addition, many of our contracts permit our customers to increase or decrease the number of aircraft under contract with a corresponding increase or decrease in the fixed monthly payments, and without a significant penalty for a decrease. Our offshore services contracts generally limit our exposure to increases in fuel costs by passing through to our customers' fuel costs in excess of pre-agreed levels. When our contracts expire, we believe that we have an advantage in renewing the contract based on the existing relationship with the customer, detailed knowledge of the specific operating environment, and an established base of equipment and personnel on site.
Operating revenues from the Oil and Gas segment accounted for 56%, 52%, and 51% of consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Air Medical. In the U.S., we provide air medical transportation services for hospitals and emergency service agencies. At December 31, 2018, we provided these services in 18 states using approximately 108 aircraft at 80 separate locations. Our Air Medical segment operates primarily under the independent provider model and, to a lesser extent, under the traditional provider model. Under the independent provider model, we have no contracts, no fixed revenue stream and compete for transport referrals on a daily basis with other independent operators in the area. Under the traditional provider model, we contract directly with specific hospitals to provide their medical transportation services, with the contracts typically awarded through competitive bidding. Our Air Medical operations are headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona.
As an independent provider, we bill for our services on the basis of a flat rate plus a variable charge per patient-loaded mile, regardless of aircraft model, and are typically compensated by Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, or directly by the transported patient. Revenues are recorded net of contractual allowances under agreements with third party payors and estimated uncompensated care at the time the services are provided. Contractual allowances and uncompensated care are primarily estimated based on our historical collection rates by payor category (consisting mainly of Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and self-pay). Changes in our payor mix, reimbursement rates or uncompensated care rates all directly impact our accounts receivable allowance and financial results for each particular reporting period. For additional information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
We also have a limited number of contracts with hospitals under which we receive a fixed fee component for aircraft availability and a variable fee component for flight time. Most of our contracts with hospitals contain provisions permitting early termination by the hospital, typically with 180 days’ notice for any reason and generally without penalty. Several of these contracts are issued or renewed based on competitive bidding.
Under a contract that commenced on September 29, 2012, our Air Medical affiliate provided multiple services to a customer in the Middle East. The volume of these ancillary services diminished over time as responsibilities were transitioned to the customer’s personnel. The contract expired on September 30, 2016 and we are no longer providing services to this customer. Additional information about the agreement is included in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
In connection with operating our domestic air medical business, we open and close bases in an effort to optimize our service offerings. As of December 31, 2018, our domestic air medical business operated seven additional bases with three more helicopters as compared to December 31, 2017.
Also included in our Air Medical segment is the patient navigation business that we commenced in 2015, pursuant to which we provide hospitals with patient transfer center services.
Operating revenues from the Air Medical segment accounted for 38%, 44%, and 44% of consolidated operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Technical Services. The Technical Services segment is principally engaged in providing helicopter repair and overhaul services for flight operations customers that own their aircraft. Costs associated with these services are primarily labor, and customers are generally billed at a percentage above our service cost. We also periodically provide flight services to governmental customers under this segment, including our agreement to operate six aircraft for the National Science Foundation in Antarctica, typically in the first and fourth quarters each year. This agreement is scheduled to lapse in April 30, 2019 and we are currently in the process of bidding upon the renewal contract. Also included in this segment is our proprietary Helipass operations, which provides software as a service to certain of our Oil and Gas customers for the purpose of passenger check-in and compliance verification.

Operating revenues from the Technical Services segment accounted for 6%, 4%, and 5% of consolidated operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Seasonal Aspects
Seasonality affects our operations in three principal ways: weather conditions are generally poorer in the winter months; hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones and other tropical storms can threaten operations in the late summer and early fall months; and reduced daylight hours restrict our operations in winter. All of those factors typically result in reduced flight hours. The seasonality of our winter and summer offshore operations is mitigated to some degree by our conduct of operations in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The adverse impact of poor visibility or darkness is also partially mitigated by our ability to conduct some of our flights under instrument flight rules (“IFR”). As of December 31, 2018, approximately 59% of our helicopters assigned to our Oil and Gas operations and 48% of our helicopters assigned to our Air Medical operations were equipped to fly under IFR, which enables these aircraft, when manned by IFR-rated pilots and co-pilots, to operate under a wider variety of conditions.
When a tropical storm begins threatening our offshore operations, flight activity may temporarily increase because of evacuations of offshore workers, but during the storms, we are unable to operate in the area of the storm and can incur significant expense in moving our aircraft, personnel and support equipment to safer locations. For a more detailed discussion of these events, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors - Risks Inherent in our Industry - Our operations are affected by adverse weather conditions and seasonal factors.” Our operating results vary from quarter to quarter, depending on seasonal factors and other factors outside of our control. As a result, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.
Inventories
We carry a significant inventory of aircraft parts in our key markets to support the maintenance and repair of our helicopters and other aircraft. Many of these inventory items are parts that have been removed from aircraft, refurbished according to manufacturers and regulatory specifications, and returned to inventory. The cost to refurbish these parts is expensed as incurred. The carrying values of inventory reported in our consolidated financial statements are affected by these various estimates and may change from time to time if our estimated values change. For additional information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Inherent in our Industry – We require aircraft components and parts for the maintenance and repair of our aircraft, and supply constraints or cost increases could adversely affect our business” – and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Inventories of Spare Parts, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
Customers
Our principal customers are major integrated energy companies and independent exploration and production companies. We also serve energy service companies, hospitals, emergency service providers, medical programs, government agencies, and other aircraft owners and operators. Our five largest customers paid us 38.1% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our largest customer is in our Oil and Gas segment and accounted for 17%, 14%, and 14% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also, another customer in our Oil and Gas segment accounted for 7%, 10%, and 10% of our consolidated operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The customer base of our Air Medical and Technical Services operations has traditionally been less concentrated than the customer base of our Oil and Gas operations. Over the past three years, none of our current Air Medical or Technical Services customers accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated operating revenues. One of our former Air Medical customers, however, did account for 5% of our consolidated operating revenues for 2016. We have entered into contracts with most of our established customers for terms of at least one year, although most contracts include provisions permitting earlier termination by the customers. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Concentration of Credit Risk, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.
Competition
Our business is highly competitive in each of our markets, and many of our contracts are typically awarded after competitive bidding. Factors that impact competition include safety, reliability, price, availability of appropriate aircraft, experience, and quality of service.
We believe we are a leading operator of helicopters in the Gulf of Mexico. There are two major and several smaller competitors operating in the Gulf of Mexico market, including leasing companies. We believe competition in our international offshore markets is as great or greater than the competition we face in the Gulf of Mexico. Although most oil companies traditionally contract for most specialty services associated with offshore operations, including helicopter services, certain of our customers and potential customers in the oil industry operate their own helicopter fleets or have the capability to do so if they so elect.

In the air medical market, we compete against national and regional firms, and there is usually more than one competitor in each local market. In addition, we compete against hospitals that operate their own helicopters and, in some cases, against ground ambulances as well.
For additional information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Inherent in our Industry – The helicopter services business is competitive.”
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 2,207 full-time employees and 39 part-time employees, including approximately 595 pilots, 627 aircraft maintenance personnel, and 349 medical support staff.
Our domestic pilot workforce is represented by the Office and Professional Employees International Union (“OPEIU”), although we and the union do not currently have an agreed-upon collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 100 of our Australian pilots and ground staff are represented by two unions pursuant to bargaining agreements, one of which is scheduled to expire on February 19, 2023, and the other of which expired on February 27, 2018. However, we have reached an agreement in principle to extend this lapsed agreement with the union and its delegates and the voting process is expected to begin soon. We are also a party to one other agreement covering a limited number of our New Zealand pilots, which expires on September 21, 2019. For additional information, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors - Other Risks Specific to our Company - Our domestic workforce is represented by a union, although we and the union do not have a current agreed upon collective bargaining agreement.”
Governmental Regulation
Our operations and the operations of most of our customers are heavily regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations.
Our domestic aviation operations are regulated primarily under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. Under this act, we cannot operate certain aircraft domestically for hire unless we receive an operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”). The FAA comprehensively regulates our domestic flight operations and exercises broad jurisdiction over our personnel, aircraft, maintenance operations, ground facilities and certain other aspects of our operations, including the authority to impose flight moratoriums. The FAA has also imposed separate safety rules applicable to helicopter air ambulance services. Domestic aircraft accidents are subject to the jurisdiction of the National Transportation Safety Board. Standards relating to the workplace health and safety of our domestic employees are created and monitored through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The radio communications networks that we maintain to communicate with our pilots are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission.
Foreign flight operations are governed by the local aviation authority. The laws of most countries require the operator of aircraft to obtain an operating license and limit foreign ownership of aviation companies. To comply with these requirements, we have from time to time formed joint ventures, cooperated with one or more local partners or entered into other alternative arrangements.
Our domestic air medical operations are also subject to healthcare-related laws and regulations, including those related to Medicare and Medicaid compliance and the privacy and security rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended. Our domestic air medical operations are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and further require us to obtain various state ambulance licenses. In addition, as a recipient of funds from state and federal governmental programs, our air medical operations are subject to a variety of stringent state and federal antifraud laws and regulations that impose substantial penalties for false claims, improper payments, tardy remittances of overpayments or improper patient referrals.
Our overseas operations are subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including (i) the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which govern the export and import of defense-related products and services, and (ii) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which generally prohibits us and our intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Various other countries have adopted similar anti-corruption laws which could, depending on their terms, apply to our overseas operations.
We and our customers are also subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Government moratoriums, restrictions or regulatory changes that adversely impact the operations of our key customers could materially reduce the demand for our services.
For additional information regarding several regulations applicable to our operations, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters.”
5

Environmental Matters
We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage, recycling, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Operating and maintaining helicopters requires that we use, store, and dispose of materials that are subject to federal and state environmental regulation. We periodically conduct environmental site surveys at certain of our facilities and determine whether there is a need for environmental remediation based on these surveys. For additional information, see Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Inherent in our Industry – Our operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive environmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.” See also Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.
