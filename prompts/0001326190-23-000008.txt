Item 1. Business
Overview
Altimmune, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for obesity and liver diseases. Our lead product candidate, pemvidutide (formerly known as ALT-801), is a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist that is being developed for the treatment of obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). In addition, we are developing HepTcell, an immunotherapeutic agent designed to achieve a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B. Except where the context indicates otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Altimmune” or the “Company” refer to the company and its subsidiaries.
Pemvidutide 
We completed an acquisition in July 2019 of all of the equity interests of Spitfire Pharma, Inc. (“Spitfire”). Spitfire was a privately held, preclinical pharmaceutical company with the primary asset being pemvidutide, a novel peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist product candidate designed to treat obesity and the metabolic dysfunction that causes NASH. 
Obesity is a significant burden to the global healthcare systems and is implicated in two-thirds of the leading causes of death from non-communicable diseases worldwide. Some of the leading co-morbidities of obesity include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and breathing problems, certain cancers and NASH. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was nearly $173.0 billion in 2019 dollars. Globally, the market size for weight loss alone was $2.4 billion in 2022 and is estimated that it will reach $54.0 billion by 2030. Previous approaches to the treatment of obesity have been associated with safety concerns, limiting the success of those approaches.
NASH involves multiple metabolic pathways leading to the abnormal accumulation of liver fat, toxic lipid metabolites, and inflammation, leading to fibrosis and increased risk of death due to liver failure and cardiovascular disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”), the fatty liver precursor to NASH, is present in up to 50% of obese patients, and up to 20% of NAFLD patients progress to NASH. We believe the treatment of obesity is a cornerstone of treating NASH and the principal morbidities of NASH. In addition, clinical evidence from recent trials of potential NASH products indicates that reduction in liver fat may play an important role in the resolution of inflammation and fibrosis. We believe that combining a reduction in liver fat content with weight loss could be the optimal approach for NASH resolution.
Pemvidutide’s dual agonist mechanism of action is designed to combine the activity of GLP-1 for the reduction of appetite and inflammation, with the activity of glucagon, including increased energy expenditure, adipose browning and mobilization of the liver fat through lipolysis and reduction of lipid synthesis. Pemvidutide incorporates a proprietary side chain, referred to as the EuPort domain, which is designed to enhance pharmacokinetics for tolerability in the gastrointestinal tract and permit weekly dosing. As observed in a well-established preclinical model of the disease, pemvidutide is capable of inducing significant weight loss with concomitant decreases in liver fat content, inflammation and fibrosis. In a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose study of pemvidutide in overweight and obese volunteers, at 12 weeks, we observed significant reductions in body weight, and in the absence of caloric restriction or lifestyle modification, as well as reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (“LDL-C”).
In addition, pemvidutide demonstrated improved metabolic function and exhibited pleiotropic effects in our preclinical testing across multiple metabolic pathways involved in NASH. We also observed in these studies that pemvidutide resulted in suppression of genes associated with steatosis, inflammation and stellate cell fibrosis by RNA sequencing. Additionally, we have now observed profound decreases and normalization in liver fat content and significant reductions in body weight at 12 weeks in a Phase 1 trial of pemvidutide in healthy volunteers and at both 12 weeks and 24 weeks in a Phase 1b trial of pemvidutide in subjects with NAFLD as well as reductions and normalization in serum alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) at both 12 weeks and 24 weeks in the Phase 1b trial. We believe that pemvidutide is the only

NASH candidate in development with observed rapid effects in liver fat reduction and liver inflammation together with significant weight loss.

Regulatory Basis for Clinical Trials of Pemvidutide
On November 9, 2020, we announced that we received clearance from the Human Research and Ethics Committee and filed a Clinical Trial Notification with the Australian regulatory authority prior to commencing our first-in-human trial of pemvidutide. On September 28, 2021, we announced that we received clearance of our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application in NASH from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) prior to commencing our Phase 1b trial of pemvidutide in NAFLD. On January 23, 2022, we further announced that we received clearance of our IND Application from the FDA prior to commencing our 48-week Phase 2 trial of pemvidutide in obesity.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results – Obesity
In September 2021, we announced the completion of a 12-week Phase 1 clinical trial of pemvidutide in Australia under a clinical trial application. The trial was a first-in-human, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose (“MAD”) study in non-diabetic overweight and obese volunteers. The endpoints of the Phase 1 trial were to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pemvidutide, with primary readouts on safety, pharmacokinetics and weight loss. Additional readouts included metabolic and lipid profiles, cardiovascular measures and glucose homeostasis. At 12 weeks, subjects receiving pemvidutide showed mean weight losses of 4.9%, 10.3% and 9.0% at the 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses, respectively, while the placebo group experienced a mean weight loss of 1.6%, and in the absence of caloric restriction or lifestyle modification. Weight loss occurred rapidly and consistently over 12 weeks.

The 1.8 mg dose cohort experienced the highest weight loss, with 100% of the subjects losing at least 5% of body weight and 55% of subjects losing at least 10% of body weight. The amounts of weight loss at the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg

doses were similar given the sample size and overlapping confidence intervals. No correlation was found between the magnitude of weight loss and either age or baseline body mass index (“BMI”). Favorable or statistically significant trends were observed in secondary measures, including reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum lipids and HOMA-IR (a measure of insulin resistance). As seen in the table below, the effect on serum lipids was particularly striking and in the 1.8mg dose, included a greater than 25% decrease in LDL-C, which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as significant decreases in total cholesterol and triglycerides. In addition, a rise in serum ketone bodies and a fall in serum tripalmitin was observed, consistent with the stimulatory effects of glucagon on hepatic beta-oxidation of lipids and suppressive effects of pemvidutide on triglyceride synthesis, respectively.

Side effects in this trial were mild to moderate, with no serious or severe treatment-emergent adverse events reported. No discontinuations due to adverse events were reported.

Unlike the majority of other clinical trials with agents within the GLP-1 class, including dual agonists and tri-agonists, dose titration, a gradual increasing of dose within a subject over a period of weeks to months to improve tolerability, was not used in the pemvidutide trial. Even without that dose titration, the symptoms experienced by subjects who received pemvidutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg were predominantly mild, did not require treatment and were consistent with known effects of GLP-1-based therapies. Tolerability was observed to decrease at the highest dose level. One subject receiving placebo and one subject receiving pemvidutide 1.8 mg had a 3 to 5-fold elevation in ALT levels over baseline that resolved rapidly after a pause in dosing. In this trial, no perturbations of glucose control, as assessed by fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c, were observed in subjects with obesity/overweight with pre-diabetes; in fact, a reduction of insulin resistance was observed, as expected when significant weight loss is experienced. We are currently conducting a Phase 1 trial to establish the effects of pemvidutide on glucose control and confirm the reduction in insulin resistance in subjects with Type 2 diabetes.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial Results – Liver Fat Content
While the trial inclusion criteria for the MAD study did not pre-specify a minimum liver fat content (“LFC”), the trial did enroll a number of subjects with measurable LFC as determined by magnetic resonance imaging – proton density fat fraction (“MRI-PDFF”). A post-hoc analysis of the trial data through 6 weeks showed that 8 subjects had hepatic steatosis, defined as liver fat content greater than or equal to 5% at baseline (LFC range from 5.5% to 19.5% in these 8 subjects). LFC fell below the limit of detection (“LOD”), or less than 1.5%, within 6 weeks of treatment in all subjects with steatosis receiving the 1.8 mg or 2.4 mg dose of pemvidutide, representing a greater than 90% reduction in the liver fat content (see chart below). These findings reinforce the results from preclinical studies of pemvidutide, in which we observed statistically greater reductions in liver fat than an equivalent dose of semaglutide. We believe these findings support the potential combined beneficial effects of weight loss and glucagon agonism on liver fat content.

Clinical Trial Results – 12-week Phase 1b (NAFLD)
In September 2022, we announced the topline results from our 12-week Phase 1b clinical trial of pemvidutide in subjects with NAFLD. The trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg pemvidutide or placebo administered weekly for 12 weeks. No dose titration was used with the 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg dose, while a short 4-week dose titration was employed at the 2.4 mg dose. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent (%) reduction in LFC from baseline, and the key secondary efficacy endpoint was the % weight loss from baseline, both at 12 weeks of treatment. The trial was conducted without adjunctive diet and exercise interventions that are the standard for obesity trials.

Ninety-four (94) subjects were randomized and treated at 13 sites across the U.S. Mean BMI at baseline was approximately 36 kg/m2 and mean LFC, as measured by MRI-PDFF, was approximately 22%. Twenty-seven (29%) subjects had type 2 diabetes at baseline, and approximately 75% of study subjects were of Hispanic ethnicity. The chart below details the baseline study demographics.

The trial met its primary endpoint in all pemvidutide treatment groups. As seen in the table below showing reduction in LFC as measured by MRI-PDFF in all subjects, at the 1.8 mg dose (with and without diabetes), pemvidutide achieved a mean reduction of liver fat content of 68.5%, with 94.4% of subjects achieving a 30% reduction in liver fat, 72.2% achieving a 50% reduction in liver fat, and 55.6% of subjects achieving normalization of liver fat, defined as liver fat fraction of 5% or less.

In addition, as shown in the below table, mean serum ALT levels declined in all subjects, and in subjects with baseline serum ALT above 30 IU/L, levels declined more than 17 IU/L at all dose levels and 27.0 IU/L in the 2.4 mg dose cohort.

The trial also met its key secondary endpoint in all pemvidutide treatment groups. As portrayed in the following table, employing an efficacy estimand, mean weight losses of 4.9% (placebo-adjusted 4.7%) in subjects without diabetes and 4.4% in subjects with diabetes (placebo-adjusted 3.9%) were achieved at the 1.8 and 2.4 mg doses, respectively.

Pemvidutide was reported to be generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal events comprised the majority of the adverse events (“AEs”). Even without dose titration, the symptoms experienced by subjects were predominantly mild and transient in nature, consistent with known GLP-1 class effects. No serious or severe AEs were reported. Two subjects treated with pemvidutide discontinued treatment due to AEs [1 (4.3%) at 1.8 mg and 1 (4.2%) at 2.4 mg], both secondary to gastrointestinal intolerability. No clinically significant ALT elevations (defined as an increase to 3-fold or greater the upper limit of normal) were observed. Glycemic control was unaffected, with no clinically meaningful changes in HbA1c or fasting glucose. Clinically meaningful reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed, along with the two to three beats per minute increase in heart rate typical for GLP-1 class of drugs. The table below summarizes the safety findings.

Clinical Trial Results – 24-week Phase 1b (NAFLD)
In December 2022, we announced the topline results from our 24-week (12-week extension) Phase 1b clinical trial of pemvidutide in subjects with NAFLD. Sixty-six (66) of the 83 subjects who completed the initial 12-week Phase 1b NAFLD trial consented to participate in this 12-week extension trial to receive a total of 24 weeks of treatment, and 64 subjects were enrolled. The trial was conducted without adjunctive diet and exercise interventions and the double-blinding of the trial was maintained during the extension study. The same endpoints as the 12-week parent NAFLD trial were employed, with a primary efficacy endpoint of percent (%) reduction in liver fat content; key secondary endpoints were reduction in liver inflammation, as measured by serum ALT levels and corrected T1 (“cT1”), and percent weight loss.
The population of the 12-week extension trial had similar baseline characteristics as the population of the parent, 12-week Phase 1b NAFLD trial. At baseline, across all treatment groups, mean BMI was 36.7 kg/m2 and mean LFC, as measured by MRI-PDFF, was 22.2%. Type 2 diabetes was present in 26.6% of subjects and 73.4% of study subjects were of Hispanic ethnicity.
The trial met its primary endpoint in all pemvidutide treatment groups. At the 1.8 mg and 2.4 mg doses, subjects receiving pemvidutide achieved mean relative reductions of liver fat content of 75.2% and 76.4%, respectively; 92.3% and 100% of subjects, respectively, achieved a 30% reduction in liver fat, 84.6% and 72.7% of subjects, respectively, achieved a 50% reduction in liver fat, and 53.8% and 45.5% of subjects, respectively, achieved normalization of liver fat. As in the 12-week Phase 1b NAFLD trial, statistically significant declines in mean serum ALT levels were observed in all pemvidutide-treated subjects, and in subjects with baseline serum ALT ≥30 IU/L, ALT levels declined at least 17 IU/L at 

12



all pemvidutide dose levels. In a subset of subjects evaluated for cT1 response, 75.0% and 100% of subjects receiving 1.8 mg or 2.4 mg pemvidutide, respectively, achieved an 80 millisecond (ms) decrease in cT1. cT1 value is an MRI-based quantitative metric for assessing a composite of liver inflammation and fibrosis. Elevated cT1 levels have been associated with increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and major adverse liver outcomes (MALO), and an 80 ms reduction has been associated with a 2-point reduction of NAFLD Activity Score (NAS).
The trial also met its key secondary weight loss endpoint in all pemvidutide treatment groups. Employing an efficacy estimand, mean weight losses of 7.2% (placebo-adjusted 6.0%) in subjects without diabetes and 6.2% (placebo-adjusted 4.8%) in all subjects were achieved at the 1.8 mg dose. A summary of the key primary and secondary efficacy findings is below:

Pemvidutide was generally well tolerated. A total of three serious or severe AEs were reported, each unrelated to study drug administration (chest pain post-elective cardiac stent placement; Salmonella infection; and hypertension greater than three weeks after the completion of treatment). Three AEs led to treatment discontinuation, one being the Salmonella infection, and two gastrointestinal AEs, one (6.3%) at the 1.2 mg dose and one (6.7%) at the 1.8 mg dose. As expected, gastrointestinal events comprised the majority of AEs and were predominantly mild in nature. No clinically significant ALT elevations were observed. Meaningful reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed, and increases in heart rate, typical of the incretin class of agents, were minimal at zero to four beats per minute and independent of dose. Below is a summarization of the safety findings:

Clinical Development Plan
We initiated a 48-week Phase 2 MOMENTUM obesity trial in the first half of 2022. The readouts of this trial will include safety, weight loss and other metabolic measures. The trial will include a 24-week interim analysis of approximately 160 subjects for safety, weight loss and other measures that we expect will read out in the first quarter of 2023. The trial is being conducted at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. The randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled approximately 320 non-diabetic subjects randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg pemvidutide or placebo weekly for 48 weeks. No dose titration is being used with the 1.2 mg or 1.8 mg dose, while a short 4-week dose titration is being employed at the 2.4 mg dose. The primary endpoint of the trial is the relative (percent) change in body weight at 48 weeks compared to baseline, with additional readouts including metabolic and lipid profiles, cardiovascular measures and glucose homeostasis. The trial is being conducted with adjunctive diet and exercise interventions that is typical in weight loss studies. On August 11, 2022, we announced that 167 subjects had been randomized and we further announced on September 28, 2022 the first dosing of all subjects in the MOMENTUM trial.
We intend to initiate a biopsy-driven Phase 2 NASH trial in 2023. We expect this trial to enroll approximately 200 subjects across 4 treatment arms (placebo, pemvidutide 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4 mg) administered for a period of 48 weeks. The primary efficacy readout will be based on a biopsy readout at the end of either 24 or 48 weeks. These details may change by the time of protocol finalization.
HepTcell 
HepTcell is an immunotherapeutic product candidate for patients chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (“HBV”). Approximately 300 million people worldwide live with chronic HBV infection, including approximately 2.2 million in the United States. Chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Approximately 780,000 people die per year worldwide due to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Current antivirals prevent disease progression but rarely clear chronic infection. HepTcell is designed to drive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against all HBV genotypes in patients of all ethnic backgrounds. Stimulating T-cell responses in chronically infected HBV patients 

15



has been challenging because chronic infection with HBV strongly suppresses T-cell immunity directed against the virus. HepTcell focuses the T cell response on discrete, highly conserved regions of the HBV proteome. We believe our approach allows HepTcell to break immune tolerance by activating T-cells against critical viral sequences with decreased probability of immune escape due to viral mutation. HepTcell is based on our synthetic peptide technology platform and is given by intramuscular injection. In 2018, we completed a Phase 1 trial in the United Kingdom and South Korea in adult patients with chronic HBV. The HepTcell Phase 1 trial was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, dose-escalation study that enrolled 61 subjects with chronic HBV who were HBeAg-negative and well-controlled on licensed antivirals. A total of 41 patients received one of two dose levels of HepTcell, with and without IC31®, a depot-forming TLR9 adjuvant developed by Valneva SE, while 20 control patients received either IC31® alone or placebo. Patients received three injections 28 days apart and were followed for six months after the final dose. All dose combinations were generally well-tolerated and met the primary endpoint of safety. In the two adjuvanted HepTcell arms, T-cell responses against HBV markedly increased over baseline compared to placebo.
The chart below presents the immunogenicity against hepatitis B epitopes that was demonstrated in our Phase 1 clinical trial:

We initiated a Phase 2 trial during the fourth quarter of 2020 in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia that is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 80 adult patients with HBeAg-negative inactive CHB and HBsAg ≤ 200 IU/mL Patients with approximately low HBsAg are more likely to mount effective T cell responses against HBV than those with higher levels. The rationale for the study design is based in our understanding that HepTcell could be used in combination with newer direct acting agents that may be more effective than the current nucleosides analogs in reducing HBsAg to this level. Accordingly, selection of patients with HBsAg levels ≤ 200 IU/mL may mimic the eventual combination of HepTcell with the newer antiviral drugs in development. HepTcell is being administered in 6 doses at the low dose level of HepTcell plus IC31® at 4-week intervals for 24 weeks, and patients will be followed for one year to evaluate safety and durability of response. The primary efficacy endpoint is virological response, defined as a 1-log reduction in HBsAg levels from baseline or HBsAg clearance at 24 weeks. Secondary efficacy endpoints include reactivation of anti-HBV T cell responses and other assessments of virologic response. We expect data from this trial in the first half of 2024. A follow-up phase will assess the safety and durability of response one year after completion of treatment.
Our Strategy
Key elements of our strategy include the following:

● | Strategically partner or out-license certain product candidates at later stages of development to focus our efforts on early to mid-stage product development;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




● | In-license or acquire complementary metabolic or immunotherapeutic technologies and product candidates that are either synergistic or complementary to our capabilities to expand our pipeline; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Apply our EuPort platform technologies to design and develop treatments for obesity, NASH and other metabolic diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology Platforms
Certain product candidates are based on our proprietary platform technologies as described below:
EuPort-based Peptide Technology
EuPort is a platform technology that comprises a hydrophobic domain (e.g., substituted or unsubstituted alkyl chain) and a hydrophilic group (e.g., saccharide) conjugated to a non-terminal amino acid of the peptide. The technology, on which pemvidutide is based, allows the peptide to bind extensively to albumin, an abundant protein in the blood, slowing the elimination of the peptide and increasing its serum half-life, allowing for weekly instead of daily dosing, for example. EuPort technology may also slow the entry of the peptide into the circulation following subcutaneous injection which may lead to improvements in tolerability, cardiovascular risk and other characteristics of the peptide as have been observed with pemvidutide. We have license rights to develop oxynomodulin (GLP1/glucagon dual receptor agonist)-based peptide therapeutics based on EuPort technology for any indication.
Key aspects of our EuPort technology, supported by findings in our preclinical studies and clinical trial, include its potential to:

● | increase the serum half-life of the peptide allowing for extended dosing intervals; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | slow the entry of the peptide into the circulation, increasing the Tmax of the peptide, and potentially improving the tolerability of the peptide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetic Peptide Technology - Densigen
Densigen is our synthetic fluorocarbon peptide technology platform. HepTcell, an immunotherapeutic developed using our Densigen platform, is designed to activate T-cells to generate a cytotoxic immune response against intracellular pathogens. This synthetic peptide technology is based on peptides of 30 – 40 amino acids that comprise a high density of CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes selected to focus the T-cell response on highly conserved targets and allow diverse populations to respond to the product candidate. Densigen technology is protected by patents owned by us.
Key aspects of our Densigen technology, supported by findings in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, include its potential to:

● | elicit responses across multiple targets for the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | direct an immune response precisely to specific antigen sites, thereby avoiding more reactive but less effective sites present in the full-length protein; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prompt a stronger immune response than naked peptides due to depot effect caused by attaching a biologically inert fluorocarbon chain to each peptide.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological progress. In general, competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position. An important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors’ products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor. Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to show differentiation with a product that is either more efficacious, 

17



particularly in the relevant target populations, offers a better safety or tolerability profile, is less expensive or quicker to manufacture, or represents a combination of these advantages. We also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sale.
Large and established companies such as Eli Lilly, Roche, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer, among others, compete in the same market as our product candidates. These companies compete with us with their greater experience and resources to support their research and development efforts, conduct testing and clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals to market products, manufacture such products on a broad scale and market approved products. These companies also compete with us by having significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the products that we develop obsolete. We also face competition from smaller companies who, like us, rely on investors to fund research and development and compete for co-development and licensing opportunities from large and established pharmaceutical companies.
We face competition for pemvidutide, our dual GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist for the treatment of obesity and NASH. For obesity, we face competition from companies such as Novo Nordisk, whose GLP-1 agonist, brand named Wegovy, or compound name semaglutide, was approved for weight loss in June 2020. Other companies with potentially competitive candidates in development, include Eli Lilly with GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (“GIP”) dual agonists, including Mounjaro, or compound name tirzepatide, which was approved in 2022 for diabetes but has also shown weight loss effect; Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck/Hanmi Pharmaceutical, AstraZeneca, Innovent Biologics/Eli Lilly, Carmot and D&D Pharma, with GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonists; Hanmi Pharmaceutical and Eli Lilly with GLP-1/glucagon/GIP triple agonists; Amgen with its GLP-1 agonist/GIP antagonist antibody; and Novo Nordisk with Amylin and Amylin-GLP-1 combination candidates. We face competition in NASH from companies such as Intercept Pharmaceuticals, which is developing a farnesoid X receptor (“FXR”) agonist; Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Terns, Aligos and Viking Therapeutics, which are developing orally administered, thyroid hormone receptor (“THR”) β-selective agonist; Akero Therapeutics, 89Bio, Novo Nordisk, Boston Pharmaceuticals and Roche, which are developing fibroblast growth factor 21 analogs; Novo Nordisk, which is developing a GLP-1 agonist; and, Inventiva, which is developing a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) agonist and orally based GLP-1 agents that either deliver GLP-1 monoagonist activity either as a peptide (Novo Nordisk) or small molecule (Pfizer, Eli Lilly). In addition, many other small companies are developing other new technologies directed towards obesity or NASH. Finally, we face competition for HepTcell, our immunotherapeutic HBV product candidate, from companies such as GSK, Janssen, Vaccitech VBI Vaccines, all of which are developing a therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV infection. In addition, many other companies are developing direct acting antivirals against HBV.
Intellectual Property
We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States and abroad. The patent coverage available to biotechnology companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can:

● | obtain patents to protect our own technologies and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | protect our trade secrets and know-how; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have relied upon certain proprietary trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop a competitive position. In efforts to maintain confidentiality and ownership of trade secrets, proprietary information and developments, all of our employees are required to execute agreements regarding confidentiality and assign to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us. We may in the future 

18



use license agreements to access external products and technologies as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
PER.C6 Cell Line — In-Licensed from Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Formerly Crucell Holland, B.V.)
We are the non-exclusive licensee of patent rights held by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (formerly Crucell Holland, B.V.) (“Janssen”), covering a method of producing an adenoviral vector stock using cell lines including the PER.C6 cell line, which may be used for the development and manufacture of vaccine products.
We entered into an amended license agreement with Janssen, effective as of October 4, 2005, which amended and restated our prior license agreements with Janssen. Under the amended license agreement, we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) under certain patent rights and know-how to use Janssen’s proprietary cell line to develop, manufacture and commercialize vaccines to prevent and/or treat influenza virus and anthrax infection in humans.
In consideration for the license, we paid an up-front license fee, issued equity shares, and agreed to pay certain development-based milestone payments through approval of licensed products by the FDA, up to an aggregate amount of approximately $2.5 million. We also agreed to pay royalty payments as a percentage of net sales of products in any country where the manufacture of such product is covered by a valid claim of any licensed patent or uses licensed know-how, subject to a royalty stacking reduction and minimum annual royalty payments, until the expiration of the term of the amended agreement.
We further amended our license agreement with Janssen, effective September 25, 2015, primarily to streamline our manufacturing license arrangements. Prior to the 2015 amendment, we entered into three-party manufacturing license agreements with each manufacturer and Janssen. The 2015 amendment enables us to directly grant sublicenses of certain of our rights under Janssen’s patent rights and know-how to manufacturers, subject to Janssen’s consent which may not be withheld if the manufacturer meets certain criteria.
We may terminate the amended license agreement without cause, and the agreement contains customary provisions for either party to terminate prior to the expiration of the agreement. The amended license agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the later of the date upon which the last of the licensed patents applicable to the relevant product expires or 15 years from the date of first commercial sale of the relevant product. The Janssen patent rights include patents issued in the United States with an expected expiration date no earlier than April 2020, in each case not giving effect to any potential extensions and assuming payment of all associated fees. Upon expiration of the amended license agreement, or if we terminate the amended license agreement for Janssen’s material breach, we retain the right to exploit the rights granted. The agreement’s current maintenance fee term is set to expire on April 2, 2023, and we have provided notice to Janssen that we do not intend to renew the agreement.
On April 2, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Restated License Agreement and additionally entered into Amendment No. 4, 5 and 6 throughout 2020 (collectively, the “Amendments”), by and between us and Janssen (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Second Restated License Agreement and Amendment No. 2 to Second Restated License Agreement, together with the Amendments, the “License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the field of licenses granted to us for the use of the PER.C6 cell line under the License Agreement is expanded to cover COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), in addition to the existing licenses related to Bacillus anthracis and influenza virus. Pursuant to the Amendment, we agreed to pay certain additional development-based milestone payments through approval of licensed products by the FDA for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19, up to an aggregate amount of $1.2 million. We also agreed to pay royalty payments as a percentage of net sales of products to a royalty stacking reduction and minimum annual royalty payments, until the expiration of the term of the License Agreement, as amended. We additionally entered into Amendment No. 4, 5 and 6 throughout 2020 to add additional manufacturing partners related to manufacturing AdCOVID. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid Janssen $3.0 million in cash and equity under the License Agreement.

Patent Rights Related to our RespirVec Platform Technology
Immunotherapy for Respiratory Pathogens — Intranasal Application of Adenoviral Vector Vaccines
While we are focusing primarily in areas other than intranasal application of adenoviral vector vaccines, we currently own patents and applications in multiple patent families related to intranasal vaccines for respiratory pathogens, including influenza, anthrax and COVID-19, using our RespirVec platform technology, with patents that have issued expiring starting not earlier than July 2024 and extending up to February 2040. We are evaluating whether we will continue to prosecute and maintain the patents and applications in these families given our current product focus.
Government Contracts
Substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from grants and United States government contracts. We are currently closing out one U.S. government contract, and have no currently active U.S. government funded research programs. There can be no assurances that we can enter into new contracts or receive new grants to supply the U.S. or other governments with our products. The process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain.
MTEC COVID-19 Contract
We funded our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of T-COVID with a $4.7 million grant from the U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command (“USAMRDC”). The competitive award was granted by USAMRDC in collaboration with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (“MTEC”), a 501(c)(3) biomedical technology consortium working in partnership with the Department of Defense (“DoD”). Under the contract, MTEC paid us a firm fixed fee based on achieving certain milestones for conduct and completion of a Phase 1/2 study. Through December 31, 2021, we collected an aggregate of approximately $4.7 million in cash under the contract and received no further funding from this contract in 2022.
We own the intellectual property rights to inventions made by us in the performance of work under the MTEC contracts provided that we disclose such inventions to the U.S. government and notify the U.S. government of our election to retain title. The U.S. government will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on our behalf, such inventions throughout the world, in addition to other rights customarily reserved by the U.S. government for intellectual property generated using government funds.
BARDA Anthrax Contract
We were developing our NasoShield anthrax vaccine pursuant to a contract with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) that commenced in July 2016. Under this contract, BARDA paid us a fixed fee and reimburses certain of our costs for the research and development of an Ad5-vectored, protective antigen-based intranasal anthrax vaccine through current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) manufacture and conduct of a Phase 1 clinical trial dose ranging assessment of safety and immunogenicity. The contract consisted of an initial base performance period providing approximately $30.9 million in funding for the period July 2016 through December 2021. BARDA had seven options to extend the contract to fund certain continued development and manufacturing activities for the anthrax vaccine, including Phase 2 clinical trials for a three-year period. Each option, if exercised by BARDA, would have provided additional funding ranging from approximately $1.1 million to $34.4 million, providing a total contract potential of $136.8 million. Through December 31, 2022, we have collected an aggregate of approximately $29.2 million in cash under the BARDA contract. BARDA did not extend the contract beyond the end of December 2021. We are currently expecting to collect final payments for indirect rate adjustments for the final two years of the contract.
We have been audited by BARDA through 2019 and have agreed on final indirect rates with BARDA through 2019.
We own the intellectual property rights to inventions made by us in the performance of work under the BARDA contracts, provided that we disclose such inventions to the U.S. government and notify the U.S. government of our election to retain title. The U.S. government will have a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice, or have practiced for or on our behalf, such inventions throughout the world, in addition to other rights customarily reserved by the U.S. government for intellectual property generated using government funds.

BARDA is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response that supports the advanced research and development, manufacturing, acquisition and stockpiling of medical countermeasures. Our contracts with BARDA, like those awarded by other U.S. government agencies, contain provisions not typically found in commercial contracts. Most notably, BARDA, or the U.S. government acting through BARDA, may terminate, modify or amend our contract, in whole or in part, for nearly any reason or no reason.
United States Government Regulation
The FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”), the FDA regulations under Titles 21 and 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR and 42 CFR), as well as other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, research, manufacturing, approval, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, import, export, reporting, sale, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs and biological products. An IND application must be in effect before clinical testing of drugs and biological products can begin. FDA approval must be obtained before drugs and biological products can be marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources, and each process may take several years to complete, although certain expedited programs potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as FDA fast track designation for certain new drugs with the potential to address unmet medical needs for certain serious or life-threatening conditions, may potentially expedite development and/or approval processes. Certain federal incentive programs are also potentially applicable to our product candidates, such as for “orphan drugs” that treat rare conditions. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our product candidates. In addition, the FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the products. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates.
Drug and Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to applicable good laboratory practices (“GLP”), applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals, such as the Animal Welfare Act or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before a clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (“GCP”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23




● | submission to the FDA of a new drug application (“NDA”) or biologics license application (“BLA”) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of clinical trials, as well as the results of preclinical testing, detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product candidate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to confirm that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to assure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of potential FDA audits of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of certain preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP and the Animal Welfare Act.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. The FDA may also place the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Even after the IND has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may also impose a partial or complete clinical hold on clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. A partial clinical hold would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects. A complete clinical hold order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed or resume. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once the trials have begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events (“AEs”) should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND during applicable phases of development. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations and GCP requirements, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, with the goals of assuring that the data and results are credible and accurate and that study participants’ rights, safety, and well-being are protected. GCP requirements include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials, not only from the investigational product itself but also from any required procedures or study visits to be conducted during the trial, are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

24



Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The drug or biological product is initially introduced into a small group of healthy human subjects (e.g., 10 to 20 volunteers) and tested for safety and to develop detailed profiles of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic actions, determine side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. The drug or biological product is evaluated in a larger but limited patient population (e.g., a few hundred patients with the disease or conduction under study) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. These clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population (e.g., several hundred to several thousand patients) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing and other sources that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within 7 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
In limited circumstances, FDA also permits the administration of investigational small molecule drug or biological products to patients under its expanded access regulatory authorities. Under the FDA’s expanded access authority, patients who are not able to participate in a clinical trial may be eligible for accessing investigational products, including through individual compassionate or emergency use in concert with their requesting physician. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Certain FDA programs are available to facilitate and expedite the development and review of new drugs intended to address unmet needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. These expedited programs include fast 

25



track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Each of these programs has its own features and qualifying criteria. A sponsor must submit a request for fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, or priority review, which may or may not be granted by the FDA. For fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, FDA may later decide the product no longer meets the conditions for designation and may rescind the designation. For accelerated approval, a sponsor generally discusses the possibility of accelerated approval with the FDA during development, and the FDA may or may not agree that accelerated approval is an appropriate pathway for a particular drug. Some of these expedited programs could potentially apply to our product candidates, although this cannot be assured, and we do not currently have any products with expedited program designations.
The sponsor of a clinical trial or the sponsor’s designated responsible party may be required to register certain information about the trial and disclose certain results on government or independent registry websites, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. Additionally, a manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy.
Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a drug or biological product candidate, the FDA’s approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product may begin. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, an NDA or BLA or supplement to an NDA or BLA generally must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers depending on the designated pathway for submission. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. FDA performance goals generally provide for action on an NDA or BLA within 10 months of the 60-day filing date, which would be within 12 months of its submission. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to 6 months of the 60-day filing date, or 8 months after submission, for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure the product’s identity, safety, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for drugs or biological products that are novel or that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
During the NDA or BLA review process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is 

26



needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than how we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant may take for the FDA to reconsider the application. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the complete response letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Post-approval modifications to a drug product, such as changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require development and submission of additional information or data in a new or supplemental NDA or BLA, which would also require prior FDA approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
After regulatory approval of a product is obtained, products are subject to extensive continuing regulation and post-approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. In addition, holders of an approved NDA or BLA are required to keep extensive records, submit annual reports, report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information, and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP regulations and practices, as well as the manufacturing conditions of approval set forth in the NDA or BLA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors and those supplying products, ingredients, and components are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes certain procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products also must comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and notify the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA or BLA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required.

27



Future FDA inspections may identify cGMP compliance issues at manufacturer facilities or at the facilities of third-party suppliers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct and prevent recurrence of any deficiencies, and could result in fines or penalties by regulatory authorities. In addition, discovery of problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, license revocations, seizure, total or partial suspension of production or criminal penalties, any of which could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications.
Certain U.S. Regulatory Incentives and Other Programs
Marketing Exclusivity and Patent Term Restoration 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, established certain periods of marketing exclusivity for new drugs approved by the FDA, including a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another applicant for such drug where the applicant does not own or have a right of reference to the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Amendment also established a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application (e.g., new indications, dosages or strengths of an approved drug). This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active ingredient for other conditions of use.
For biological products, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”) created an abbreviated regulatory approval pathway in the United States for biological products that are found to be “biosimilar” to (and in some instances “interchangeable” with) a biological “reference product” previously licensed under an NDA or BLA. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively by relying to some extent on the data generated by the reference product’s sponsor and the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference product. Under the BPCIA, a biosimilar sponsor’s ability to seek or obtain approval through the abbreviated pathway is limited by periods of exclusivity granted by the FDA to the holder of the reference product’s NDA or BLA. In general, no biosimilar application may be accepted by the FDA for review until 4 years after the date the reference product was first licensed by the FDA, and no biosimilar application, once accepted, may receive final approval until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed by the FDA.
While we would expect to be granted this 12-year period of exclusivity for our applicable product candidates, if approved, this period of reference product market exclusivity applies only to the biosimilar pathway and will not, for example, provide protection against any biological product for a similar indication that achieves FDA approval under a traditional NDA or BLA based on the sponsor’s own research data. There is also risk that the 12-year period of biological reference product exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates, if they are approved, to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Once approved, biosimilars likely would compete with, and in some circumstances may be deemed under the law to be interchangeable with, the previously approved reference product. The extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, would be substituted for any one of our product candidates, if approved, in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Given this uncertainty, there is risk that, if approved, a biosimilar competitor to one of our products could have an adverse impact on our business. In particular, a biosimilar could be significantly less costly to bring to market and priced significantly lower than our product, if approved by the FDA.

28



Additionally, products approved under an NDA or BLA may qualify for the restoration of a portion of the patent term lost during product development and FDA review of the application, if approval of the application is the first permitted commercial marketing of a drug containing the active ingredient. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of the IND or the date of patent grant (whichever is later) and the date of submission of the NDA or BLA, plus the time between the date of submission of the NDA or BLA and the date of FDA approval of the product. The maximum period of restoration is five years, and the patent cannot be extended to more than 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product. Only one patent claiming each approved product is eligible for restoration and the patent holder must apply for restoration within 60 days of approval. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term restoration.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Drugs and biological products, such as our product candidates, may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, an incentive intended to encourage medical product research for children. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, may add six months to certain patents or regulatory exclusivity periods applicable to an approved drug and six months to regulatory exclusivity periods applicable to an approved biological product. This additional six months of exclusivity may be granted based on the completion of one or more pediatric trials in response to a Written Request from the FDA. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may be targeted to pediatric populations. 
Orphan Drug Designation
The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition” that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such a disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user fee exemptions. In addition, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product may be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA would not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. It is possible, but not assured, that certain of our current or future product candidates may target rare diseases or conditions.
U.S. Regulations Affecting Health Care Companies
Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products that are reimbursed by U.S. federally funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are subject to so-called fraud and abuse laws including false claims and anti-kickback laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willingly, directly or indirectly, soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying any remuneration with the intent of (or in return for) generating referrals of individuals or purchases, leases, orders, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable by federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have interpreted this law very broadly, including by holding that a violation has occurred if one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals even if there are other lawful purposes. Moreover, liability under the Anti-Kickback Law may be established without proving actual knowledge of the law or specific intent to violate. There are statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements from prosecution or administrative sanctions, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. The fact that an arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not necessarily render the conduct illegal under the Anti-Kickback Law, but the arrangement may be subject to scrutiny based on the facts and circumstances. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors and speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may be punished by civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or exclusion from participation in 

29



federal health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have enacted similar laws, some of which apply regardless of payer.
The Federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. The FCA is commonly enforced against those who submit allegedly false Medicare or Medicaid claims, as well as those who induce or assist others to submit a false claim. “False claims” can result not only from non-compliance with the express requirements of applicable governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicaid or Medicare, but also from non-compliance with other laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Law or laws that require quality care in service delivery. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the government or by whistleblowers referred to as “relators,” who may initiate an action in the name of the government and the individual and may share in any monetary recovery. Violations of the FCA can result in treble damages, mandatory per claim penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, some of which are broader than the FCA, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to FCA penalties.
The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the FCA and federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things, made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal FCA liability. The bringing of any FCA or other enforcement investigation or action, even if unsuccessful, could require us to devote resources to investigate and defend the action, as well as result in reputational harm. Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, many of these laws are vague, subject to modification, and are subject to evolving interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. We cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition to the above, several other laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials. Some state laws restrict whether and when pharmaceutical companies may provide meals to health care professionals or engage in other marketing-related activities; some states require certain compliance program elements and disclosures; and certain states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives.
For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”), prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Law, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating the HIPAA fraud statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Violations of HIPAA fraud provisions may result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties, fines and damages, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Privacy Laws
In the U.S., we may be subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, health information and/or genetic privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act, HIPPA and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related 

30



and other personal information. Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, thus complicating compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys, including class action attorneys, have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.
The CCPA, for example establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency, and provides California residents certain rights concerning their personal data. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency. The amendments introduced by the CPRA became effective on January 1, 2023, and it is not yet fully clear how the CCPA and CPRA will be enforced and interpreted. The effects of the CCPA and CPRA are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data collection or processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Certain other states have passed legislation similar to the CCPA, which will provide individuals with new privacy rights and increase the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data of such individuals. For example, in March 2021, Virginia enacted the Consumer Data Protection Act which became effective on January 1, 2023. In July 2021, Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, which will become effective on July 1, 2023. Additionally, in March 2022, Utah enacted the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, which will become effective on December 31, 2023. Also, in May 2022, Connecticut signed the Connecticut Data Privacy Act into law, which will become effective on July 1, 2023.
A number of additional states have proposed bills for comprehensive privacy legislation, and it is possible that certain of these bills will pass. The existence of new comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country, if enacted, could add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk. Such new laws could also require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies regarding and the availability of personal data, and would result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies.
On the federal level, HIPAA imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may obtain health information from third parties, such as research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
Outside of the U.S., the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to become more comprehensive. There has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues that could potentially affect our business, including as a result of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU and the U.K. and data protection laws in the U.K. The EU GDPR (and the regulation as incorporated in U.K. law) imposes fines of up to EUR 20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of the annual global revenue of a noncompliant company, for non-compliance. In addition, laws and regulations enacted in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America increases potential enforcement and litigation activity.
If we, our agents, or our third-party partners fail to comply or are alleged to have failed to comply with these or other applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, or if we were to experience a data breach involving personal information, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or private lawsuits. Any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or other government actions could lead to unfavorable outcomes that have a material impact on our business including through significant penalties or fines, monetary judgments or settlements including criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, or other remedies that harm our business, including orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.
U.S. Health Care Reform Law
Our financial prospects could be affected by changes in health care spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, regulations, or judicial decisions, or new interpretations 

31



of existing laws, regulations, or decisions, related to, among other things, health care availability, or the method of delivery of or payment for health care products and services could negatively impact our business, operations and financial condition.
For example, in the United States there is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Law”). The Health Care Reform Law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and commercial payers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Health Care Reform Law contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, by increasing the minimum rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extending the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, addressing a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and imposing certain annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.
The Health Care Reform Law established and provided significant funding for a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund comparative effectiveness research. While the stated intent of comparative effectiveness research is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of comparative effectiveness research could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost effective than others. Should any of our products be approved for sale, but then determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our financial results.
Certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the tax-based payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amended the Medicare statute, effective January 1, 2019, to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare prescription drug plans, commonly known as the “donut hole,” by raising the manufacturer discount under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program to 70%. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes and judicial challenges related to the Health Care Reform Law remain possible, but the nature and extent of such potential changes or challenges are uncertain at this time. It is unclear how the Health Care Reform Law, its implementation, efforts to repeal, replace or otherwise modify, or invalidate, the Health Care Reform Law, or portions thereof, and other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future will affect our business. Another provision of the Health Care Reform Law, generally referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations have been extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists and certified nurse-midwives. CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website. Our compliance with these rules may also impose additional costs and may impact our relationships with physicians, teaching hospitals and the other non-physician health care providers.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things led to aggregate reductions in Medicare payments for all items and services, including prescription drugs and biologics, to service providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year beginning April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislation, will continue until 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension that lasted from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Following the suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022 and remained through June 30, 2022, The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. As another example, for calendar quarters beginning January 1, 2022, manufacturers will be 

32



required to report the average sales price for certain drugs under the Medicare program regardless of whether we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Previously, such reporting was only required for manufacturers that participated in that program. Starting in 2023, manufacturers must pay refunds to Medicare for single source drugs or biologicals, or biosimilar biological products, reimbursed under Medicare Part B and packaged in single-dose containers or single-use packages, for units of discarded drug reimbursed by Medicare Part B in excess of 10% of total allowed charges under Medicare Part B for that drug. Manufacturers that fail to pay refunds could be subject to civil monetary penalties of 125% of the refund amount.
The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new mandatory discounts from manufacturers under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost single-source drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, and require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. The IRA provides a five-year temporary increase in Medicare Part B payment for certain qualifying biosimilars, and it also delays the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes or guidance could be adopted, which may impact the marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates.
Further, there has been increasing legislative, regulatory and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, evaluate the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government healthcare program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
It is possible that the Health Care Reform Law, as currently enacted or may be amended or otherwise modified in the future, as well as other health care reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare payment and other health care financing, more rigorous coverage criteria, and new payment methodologies and in additional downward pressure on coverage and payment and the price that we receive for any approved product. For example, under the IRA, Congress has enacted a program that allows Medicare to negotiate pricing for certain single-source drugs and biologics under Medicare Parts B and D. The IRA also imposes Medicare Part B and Part D inflation-based rebates, under which manufacturers owe additional rebates if the average sales price of a drug increases faster than the pace of inflation, based on a statutory reference period. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. These continuing health care reform initiatives may adversely affect:

● | the demand for any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the level of taxes that we are required to pay.
--+------------------------------------------------

Congress also could enact additional changes that affect our overall rebate liability and the information we report to the government as part of price reporting calculations. In addition, Congress could enact a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend single source drugs would be capped by reference to the non-federal average manufacturer price. This or any other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our products. We further expect continued scrutiny on government price reporting and pricing more generally from Congress, agencies, and other bodies.

33



Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payers is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. The availability of coverage and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payers is essential for most patients to be able to afford treatments such as gene therapy products. Sales of these or other product candidates that we may identify will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers. If coverage and adequate reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines may be made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent certain new medicines will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payers tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Environmental Regulations
We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by our operations. Our research and development involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and viruses. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. Additionally, for formulations containing controlled substances, we are subject to Drug Enforcement Act regulations.
Pricing Regulations
There have been a number of federal and state legislative changes made over the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products, government control and other changes to the health care system of the United States. Concerns about drug pricing continue to be expressed by members of Congress and prior presidential administrations. It is uncertain how such legislative changes will be adopted or what actions federal, state or private payers for medical goods and services may take in response to such legislation. We cannot predict the effect such health care changes will have on our business, and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect.
Non-U.S. Government Regulations
European Drug Development
Our products will also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements in the European Union (“EU”). As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. See “European Marketing Authorization” below.

34



In the EU, the new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 has been applicable since January 31. 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation repealed and replaced the Clinical Trials Directive, and introduced a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that will be conducted in multiple EU Member States, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The transitory provisions of the new Clinical Trials Regulation provide that ongoing clinical trials previously authorized under the Clinical Trials Directive can remain under the Directive, or they can transition to the Regulation. By January 31, 2025, when all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State) and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
Similar to the FDA, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) has adopted ICH S6 as a guideline governing preclinical testing of biologics. Sponsors usually must conduct pharmacodynamic (“PD”) studies, such as in vitro binding assays and in vivo studies that assess the product’s pharmacologic activity and define its mechanism of action. Biologics typically undergo single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies using relevant species. Safety pharmacology studies, which evaluate the product’s functional effects on major body systems and specific organs, and local tolerance testing can be done separately or subsumed in toxicity testing. Sponsors also usually conduct single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (“PK”) and/or toxicokinetic studies to assess absorption, disposition, exposure and clearance (in particular, antibody-mediated clearance), and explore dose-response relationships. This information is used to predict margins of safety for human studies. Immunogenicity testing might include screening and mechanistic studies.
Good Clinical Practices and Other Considerations for Clinical Trials
Clinical trials of medical products (including biologics) must comply with GCP, as described in Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice and the ICH E6 guideline, which the CHMP has adopted. The Directive and guideline describe general governing principles for clinical trials. The rights, safety and well-being of trial subjects must prevail over the interests of science and society. Investigators must obtain freely given informed consent from every trial subject before each subject is enrolled. Clinical trial information must be handled, recorded and stored with respect for relevant confidentiality and privacy rules. Trials must comply with the ethical principles of the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. Specific GCP guidelines apply to trials of advanced therapy medicinal products (i.e. gene therapy, somatic-cell therapy and tissue-engineered medicines). These guidelines regulate issues such as the donation, procurement and testing of human tissues and cells; the implementation of a traceability system; and specific rules on safety reporting and long-term follow-up. Under the Clinical Trials Regulation, special requirements apply to clinical trials conducted on minors and other persons not able to give informed legal consent. These requirements are intended to preserve the dignity of the trial subjects, confirm that the benefits of the trial outweigh the risks and ensure that subjects’ representatives give consent with as much involvement of the subject as possible. CHMP has also issued a guideline on quality requirements during the clinical trial period for investigational medicinal products containing biological or biotechnology-derived substances. The guideline describes quality documentation that should be submitted to the competent authority as part of the sponsor’s investigational medicinal product dossier (“IMPD”). The IMPD should include, among other things, (i) an adequate description of the process and process controls, including a flow chart of all successive steps and details of in-process testing and (ii) a description and justification of “any reprocessing during manufacture of the drug substance.” The guideline also recognizes that sponsors will improve and optimize their manufacturing processes during clinical development and describes the steps sponsors should take following these changes. Specifically, the sponsor must compare the quality attributes of the pre- and post-change biological active substances and relevant intermediates and conduct a comparability exercise where necessary. For first-in-human clinical trials, sponsors should use product representative of the material used during the non-clinical testing phase. Finally, with 

35



regard to characterization, the guideline requires details on the biological activity to be provided, recognizing that the extent of characterization data will further increase in later phases.
Study Design Considerations
General regulatory guidance on study design applies to biologics as well as small molecule medicines. According to the guidance, there is a “close, but variable correlation” between phase of development and type of study, but one type of trial can occur in several different phases. The guidance therefore identifies the most typical kind of study for each phase.
Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational product into human subjects, and studies in this phase usually have non-therapeutic objectives. Specifically, Phase 1 studies typically investigate initial safety and tolerability, PK, PD and/or drug activity, to preliminarily determine the potential therapeutic benefit of a medicine. Phase 1 studies may be conducted in healthy volunteers or certain types of patients. If the medicine has significant potential toxicity (e.g., cytotoxic products), the trial will usually be conducted in patients.
The most typical Phase 2 study is a therapeutic exploratory study that explores efficacy in narrowly defined, relatively homogenous groups of patients. Initially, studies may use a variety of designs (e.g., concurrent controls and comparisons with baseline status). Subsequent Phase 2 trials usually are randomized and concurrently controlled, allowing for evaluation of the medicine’s safety and efficacy for a particular indication. A major goal of this phase is to determine the dose(s) for Phase 3 trials.
Phase 3 typically involves therapeutic confirmatory studies that are designed to verify the preliminary evidence obtained in Phase 2 and to provide a sufficient basis for marketing authorization. Phase 3 studies may also further explore the dose response relationship, or explore the drug’s use in wider populations, in different stages of disease, or in combination with another drug. With regard to medicines administered for long periods, extended exposure trials ordinarily occur during Phase 3, although the sponsor may start them in Phase 2.
To ensure that clinical trials in all three phases of development will be adequate to support a marketing authorization application (“MAA”), sponsors should design these trials with the MAA requirements in mind. Certain biologics products need to comply with the requirements set out in Part III of the Annex I to Directive 2003/63/EC (which amends the core EU medicines legislation, Directive 2001/83/EC), and advanced therapy medicinal products need to comply with the requirements described in Part IV.
Consultation with the European Medicines Agency
A sponsor may obtain, from the EMA, scientific advice regarding the development of a medicinal product. Although this advice does not bind the EMA and is not binding for purposes of a future MAA, it can be useful to guide developers generally in performing the appropriate preclinical and clinical tests for the product, or on more specific aspects such as guiding revisions to a clinical trial protocol. EMA’s remarks will only address scientific issues and will generally focus on matters such as the selection of endpoints and comparator, the duration of treatment or follow-up and the design of pivotal studies. Advice also might address a sponsor’s proposal to deviate from a CHMP guideline. If the applicant decides not to follow the EMA’s advice, it should justify this decision in its MAA. EMA guidance details the procedures for requesting scientific advice. The fact that an applicant requests advice from EMA does not preclude it from also seeking advice from national competent authorities or from foreign regulators, such as the FDA. The process of obtaining advice from the national competent authorities is often less formal than requesting advice from the EMA, and such advice can prove helpful. Consequently, seeking such advice is a common choice among applicants. Generally, the parallel scientific procedure (a program shred by the EMA and FDA) is available for “important breakthrough drugs,” that is, products that the EMA and FDA have identified as falling within therapeutic areas of overlapping interest (e.g., oncology products, vaccines and blood products). The goal of these meetings is to provide clarity regarding the regulatory requirements of each region and the reasons for any differences between them. A sponsor requesting parallel scientific advice should authorize the agencies to exchange all information about the product, including trade secrets. After the parallel scientific advice procedure, each agency will provide its own independent advice on the questions at issue. There is no guarantee of harmonized advice or identical regulatory decisions on the approvability of the product.

36



European Marketing Authorization
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which includes the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after the grant of a marketing authorization. The MAA is based on the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted on the medicinal product in question. There are two types of marketing authorizations:

● | The centralized marketing authorization, which is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the CHMP and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of drugs, such as medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes (such as genetic engineering), orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products and medicinal products containing new active substances indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. . The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. . To find out whether a product can be evaluated via the centralized procedure, applicants should always submit an eligibility request to the EMA, including by a justification of eligibility for evaluation under the centralized procedure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National marketing authorizations, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for drugs not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a drug has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National marketing authorization can be recognized in other member states through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the drug has not received a National marketing authorization in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved by multiple member states in parallel through the Decentralized Procedure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the drug on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
The Marketing Authorization Application: Contents and Approval Standard
Many biologics fall under the scope of the centralized procedure, which, as mentioned above, is mandatory for medicines developed through biotechnological methods, such as recombinant DNA technology; controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including transformed mammalian cells; and hybridoma and mAb methods. Gene therapy and cell therapy products are also subject to the centralized procedure as advanced therapy medicinal products. Nonetheless, some biologics are still approved at the member state level. For example, certain types of vaccines do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure (although they may be eligible for the centralized procedure in the interest of public health). The EMA has published a guideline intended to harmonize the quality aspects to be included in summaries of product characteristics and patient information leaflets for human vaccines.
With respect to the centralized procedure, the approval standards for biotechnology products are the same as for chemically synthesized medicines. Both types of products must be safe and effective and have appropriate quality. Because of their special characteristics, however, biotechnology products must comply with several additional dossier requirements. For example, the applicant must thoroughly describe the manufacturing process and must: (i) provide information on the origin and history of the starting materials; (ii) demonstrate that the active substance complies with specific measures for preventing the transmission of animal and human spongiform encephalopathies; (iii) if cell banks are used, demonstrate that cell characteristics remain unchanged at the passage level for production (and beyond); (iv) provide information as to whether there are adventitious agents in seed materials, cell banks, pools of serum or plasma, and all other materials of biological origin, and, if it is not possible to avoid the presence of potentially pathogenic adventitious agents, show that further processing ensures elimination or inactivation of the agents; (v) if possible, base vaccine production on a seed lot system and established cell banks; (vi) in case of medicines derived from human blood or plasma, describe the origin, criteria and procedures for the collection, transportation and storage of the starting material; 

37



and (vii) describe the manufacturing facilities and equipment. Other special rules apply certain types of biological medicines. For example, for plasma-derived medicinal products, the applicant must provide an information dossier, the Plasma Master File. MAAs for vaccines other than for influenza need to contain a Vaccine Antigen Master File. Special rules also apply to advanced therapy medicinal products, including gene therapies, somatic cell therapies and tissue-engineered products.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the EU, new chemical entities (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. After such eight year period, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed for two years. The overall ten-year period may be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the period of data exclusivity, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Orphan Designation in the European Union
The European Commission is also able to grant orphan designation in respect of medicinal products. To qualify the medicinal product must be intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (i) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU or (ii) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU where without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. Further, no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question must exist in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan medicinal products still remain subject to the same regulatory approval process, albeit that they are always assessed through the centralized procedure. Effective September 19, 2018, sponsors applying for orphan designation must use EMA’s secure online IRIS platform. However, sponsors of orphan medicinal products are eligible to benefit from a number of incentives offered, including certain assistance with development of the medicinal product, reduced fees for MAAs and protection from market competition once the medicinal product is authorized, as described below.
Where a marketing authorization in respect of an orphan medicinal product is granted, the European Commission, EMA and the competent authorities of the EU member states shall not, for a period of ten years, accept another application for a marketing authorization or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing authorization , for the same therapeutic indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product, unless: (i) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product has given its consent to the second applicant; (ii) the holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product; or (iii) the second applicant can establish the second medicinal is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the authorized orphan product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication.
Other government regulation in the European Union and United Kingdom
The EU and the EU member states and the U.K. have extensive laws and regulations relating to a variety of other topics that would be of relevance for us if we are active in the EU and U.K., including but not limited to laws and 

38



regulations regarding data privacy, drug pricing and reimbursement, advertising and interactions with healthcare professionals.
Other Jurisdictions
In addition to regulations in the United States and the EU, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product. As the United Kingdom is no longer a member state of the EU, this may also apply to the United Kingdom. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval from comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and the approval of the regulators of foreign countries before we may market products in such countries. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trials in the United States and the European Union
The FDA has issued regulations governing its acceptance of foreign clinical data not conducted under an IND to support IND applications or marketing authorizations, such as BLAs. FDA may accept a well-designed, well-conducted, non-IND foreign study as support for an IND or marketing application if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP and if FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Where a marketing application is based solely on foreign data, additional requirements apply, including a demonstration that the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice.
EU Directive 2001/83/EC allows for clinical trials conducted outside the EU to be taken into consideration during the review of a marketing authorization in the EU if such trials have been designed, implemented and reported based on principles equivalent to those of the Clinical Trials Regulation, including with regard to good clinical practice and ethical principles. Moreover, they should comply with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The applicant must submit a statement declaring such compliance as part of the marketing authorization. In December 2008 and April 2012, the EMA published a strategy paper on the acceptance of data from foreign clinical trials conducted in “third countries,” particularly those outside the “‘traditional’ Western European and North American research areas.” According to the 2008 strategy paper, there is a “growing concern both among regulators and in public debate about how well these trials are conducted from an ethical and scientific/organizational standpoint.” The EMA has called for increased cooperation between international regulatory authorities involved in the supervision of clinical trials and has put forth other proposals to address these issues.
Manufacturing and Source of Supply
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. To date, we have obtained materials for clinical trials and non-clinical studies from third-party manufacturers who are suppliers to us. For our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional contract manufacturers to provide commercial scale manufacturing prior to submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA.
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 52 full-time employees, 18 of whom hold M.D. or Ph.D. degrees and 34 of whom hold other advanced degrees. Of our total workforce, 28 are engaged primarily in research and development activities and 19 are engaged primarily in executive, finance and accounting, and administrative functions. As of December 31, 2022, 50 employees are located in the United States and 2 employees in the United Kingdom. Of our employees, 58% are female and 42% are male. None are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate Culture

39



Our values – compliance, collaboration, integrity and high performance – are built on the foundation that the employees we hire and the way we treat one another promote creativity, innovation and productivity, which spur our success. This culture depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain and develop a diverse population of talents and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. Providing market competitive pay and benefit programs, opportunities to participate in the success they help create, while engaging employees in important dialogue regarding organization performance, we create a culture of inclusion in which all colleagues have the opportunity to thrive. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. 
Compensation and Benefits Program
Our compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide all of our employees with what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits, as well as participation in our equity programs.
Hybrid Culture and COVID-19
Like other companies, we have learned to adapt during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have prioritized employee safety and transparency during the pandemic and continue to do so, ensuring all employees are set up to work remotely and providing clarity on office closures and evolving guidelines issued by the CDC, the WHO and state and local authorities, where possible. In the second quarter of 2020, we made the decision to move to a hybrid workplace model, which means that certain of our employees will have the option to be 100% remote, work full-time in our office, or have the flexibility to work between office and remotely until the pandemic is resolved. This move provides our employees with continued flexibility, through the resolution of the pandemic, to work in person, remotely or in a hybrid model. This will enable us to grow better as we develop our programs.
