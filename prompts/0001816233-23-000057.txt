ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “Sharecare” refer to Sharecare, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a leading digital healthcare platform company that helps members consolidate and manage various components of their health in one place, regardless of where they are on their health journey. Our health and well-being interoperable ecosystem unifies the elements of individual and community health so everyone can live better, longer across the dynamic continuum of their healthcare needs. We are driven by our philosophy that we are “All Together Better” as well as our goal to turn individual progress into community transformation.
Our digital first ecosystem is centered on the person. We believe everyone’s health and well-being is inherently interconnected. Just as a person’s physical health is inextricably linked to their mental and emotional health, an individual’s health is also connected to a greater collective that includes their employer, providers, insurers, colleagues, family, friends, and local communities. However, these groups have historically remained very disconnected with various stakeholders providing hundreds of fragmented point solutions, each addressing only one or two specific health-related objectives. By integrating fragmented point solutions and bringing together disparate stakeholders across the entire healthcare ecosystem into one connected, interoperable virtual care platform, we believe that we can fulfill the role of a unifier and leverage smartphone technology to foster a frictionless user-friendly experience that engages people across the dynamic continuum of their healthcare needs. We have built our platform into what we believe is the most comprehensive and seamless experience currently available in the digital healthcare space.
Our platform offers an accessible, interactive, personalized and rewarding environment that aims to transform user engagement with healthcare from episodic to everyday. The platform provides a single destination for people, patients and caregivers to access quality and clinically reviewed content; digitally connect with other patients, community members and healthcare professionals; and adopt action plans provided by healthcare professionals from top institutions. Centralized within its dynamic digital platform, we provide health assessment and wellness tools and population health services to create personalized action plans, improve productivity and reduce health-related costs. We also provide physicians and physician practices with value-based care arrangements through the use of various tools geared towards identifying care gaps, patient engagement and billing efficiencies. Additionally, we provide secure, automated release of information, electronic medical record archiving and business consulting services to streamline the medical records process for both patients and medical facilities. Sharecare also yields strong return on investment performance on behalf of its life sciences and pharmaceutical partners through consumer acquisition campaigns that utilize data-driven and contextual lead generation, sponsorships, audience targeting and condition-specific marketing. Finally, we support care through our network of home caregivers and nurses. We deliver value via our provider, enterprise, and life sciences channels. The consumer solutions channel (as referenced in previous filings) was renamed the life sciences channel in January 2022 in order to more accurately portray the customer base of the channel. 
Since the Sharecare platform was launched in 2012, it has grown to approximately 80,000 employer clients, 12.1 million eligible lives, and 6,000 hospitals and physician practices. 
Business Combination
Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp., our predecessor company (“FCAC”), was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on June 5, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more operating businesses. On July 1, 2021, FCAC consummated a business combination (the “Business Combination”) pursuant to terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 12, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among FCAC, FCAC Merger Sub Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of FCAC (“Merger Sub”), Sharecare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Legacy Sharecare”), and the stockholder representative. Immediately upon the completion of the Business Combination and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Legacy Sharecare with Legacy Sharecare surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (as successor to FCAC). In connection with the Business Combination, we changed our name from “Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp.” to “Sharecare, Inc.” and Legacy Sharecare changed its name to “Sharecare Operating Company, Inc.,” and we continued the listing of our common stock and public warrants on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “SHCR” and “SHCRW,” respectively. See the section entitled “SPAC Transaction” in Note 1 to Sharecare’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Business Combination. 
Our Strengths
Comprehensive Platform. Designed to help individuals, workforces and communities optimize their holistic well-being, our interoperable platform is based on human centered design principles and integrates fragmented point solutions and disparate stakeholders that provide a single place for members to interact with all features and services offered by us and our partners to foster a frictionless user-friendly experience. Moreover, our platform has both a flexible infrastructure and is scalable and configurable, which allows us to meet the different and evolving needs of our clients. The flexibility and adaptability of our platform infrastructure also allows us to partner with, and seamlessly integrate, third-party solutions into our ecosystem to promote a high degree of awareness, engagement, and outcomes through an integrated flow of data. 
Large, Well Established Clients. We have a large, diverse and well-established client base — including large health plans, Fortune 100 companies, and large public sector clients— which we believe provides us with significant existing revenue opportunity from signed contracts, and opportunity to increase penetration of our products and services and optimize member engagement and enrollment.
Diverse Product Portfolio. We have a diverse portfolio of products and solutions that are marketed to a variety of users within our enterprise, provider, and life sciences channels. We believe that the diversity of these offerings, together with our ability to bundle them into a comprehensive and integrated platform, provides compelling value over other digital health platforms or point solutions that are focused more narrowly on one or two specific health-related needs. Our portfolio of products also offers members clinical connectivity through various incorporated touch points to healthcare systems and/or to providers and enables us to offer tailored and personalized tools, including the ability to interact directly with family and clinical advocates and lifestyle management and disease management coaches on our platform.
Value of Technology, Innovation and Data. We derive significant value from our proprietary technology platform that leverages an innovative architecture and data aggregation capabilities to give members a hyper-personalized experience. Through our platform, we offer a portfolio of privacy-first technologies and AI software services to drive personalization of our digital assets and create improved value for members. Our single robust platform, designed to service all our stakeholders, including consumers, health plan members, employees, provider groups, health systems, and Blue Zones Project sites/communities, is built on an advanced, multi-tenant enabled technology stack that uses the latest design patterns for scale and flexibility.
Our data architecture enables us to ingest substantial amounts of multivariate data sets, such as eligibility, claims, biometrics, and social determinants of health data, from multiple sources in near real-time. The value we can provide to members from the quality and quantity of our data (more than 1.8 petabytes) uniquely positions us to scale, commercialize, contextually intervene, and materially engage members. 
Comprehensive Content Library. We have a comprehensive library comprised of original material as well as content from more than 180 organizations (including the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control/CDC, and the American Diabetes Association, among others). We perform medical review of published content at two-year intervals, but often more frequently, to ensure accuracy, timeliness and relevance. Performing reviews on this schedule is also consistent with our NCQA Wellness and Health Promotion and Disease Management accreditation standards.  The size and quality of our content library allows us to deliver highly personalized content to our members, which drives engagement and builds trust.
Growth Strategy
Expand our Footprint and Existing Client Relationships. We believe that our current client base represents a small fraction of potential clients that could benefit from our highly differentiated solutions. We also believe that there is significant opportunity to generate growth by maintaining and expanding our relationships with existing clients, including: 
•increasing engagement and enrollment of eligible members at our existing enterprise clients;
•facilitating intervention with Sharecare+, our high-touch, digital-first advocacy driving high quality experience, care, and value support;
•promoting our marketplace of existing targeted digital therapeutics to close gaps in care in high-cost areas (with incremental fee per enrollee); and
•expanding our relationships with our top 25 provider clients with an opportunity to extend our provider products and services to more than 8,500 additional healthcare sites.
Continue to Grow the Capabilities of our Platform. We are constantly evaluating the marketplace for ways to broaden and enhance our client and member experience, improve clinical results and increase revenue through product innovation, partnerships and acquisitions. For example, during 2022 we introduced Sharecare+, our whole health, payor-agnostic advocacy solution that seamlessly layers on top of our flagship digital engagement platform designed to help health plans and self-insured 
employers increase efficiency, productivity, and quality, and reduce cost of care while making members and employees and their families happier, healthier, and more productive. We believe that our proven track record of successful acquisitions coupled with the flexibility and capabilities of our platform positions us to continue opportunistically pursuing attractive M&A opportunities. We intend to continue to look for opportunities to leverage our platform and expertise to provide first-mover solutions to evolving and future demands in the digital healthcare industry.
Evolving Products to Cater to an Evolving Industry. As the digital healthcare industry grows, we closely monitor evolving consumer trends and organizations’ needs so that we may adapt our platform to better suit our clients’ demands. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic greatly accelerated the demand for virtual care solutions and resulted in rapid growth and increased adoption of digital health technologies, which we were well positioned to undertake. 
Our Channels
Focusing on the individual, we aim to provide a solution that is more comprehensive than other digital platforms by bringing together scientifically validated clinical programs and engaging content to deliver a personalized experience for our members, whether they come to us by way of the workplace, the exam room, or the living room. Strategically and intentionally building on this concept, our business is structured across three primary channels: enterprise, provider, and life sciences. While we are focused on the individual’s unique experience, our platform is purpose-built to seamlessly connect stakeholders to the health management tools they need to drive engagement, establish sustained participation, increase satisfaction, reduce costs, and improve outcomes, regardless of entry point. 
Enterprise Solutions
Our enterprise solutions are based on a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) model that allows enterprise clients to message, motivate and manage their populations, and measure their populations’ progress, through one platform. Our enterprise clients can leverage our scientifically validated clinical protocols and personalized approaches, which drive high-impact engagement to achieve measurable outcomes and close gaps in care for their populations. With our tech-enabled home care we are able to further support high-touch and high-tech care across the entire care continuum. Our enterprise clients include a range of stakeholders, from large employers and health systems to government agencies and health plans, that use our digital platform to engage with their populations, dynamically measure the impact of that engagement, and efficiently deliver health and wellness services. We generate revenue from our enterprise clients by providing access to our core digital platform on a per member, per month basis with incremental fees charged per enrollee for access to our marketplace of digital therapeutics.
Provider Solutions
We offer providers a suite of data and information-driven solutions that are tailored to improve productivity and efficiency and enhance patient care and management while upholding the latest compliance, security and privacy standards. We have integrated a range of capabilities and introduced new services to support providers in a number of ways, and our current offerings include:
•Health Information Management: Automates health record requests, using a simple and efficient consent-based record access management solution. 
•Value-Based Care: Enables providers and health systems to participate in value-based care arrangements by providing capabilities to identify care gaps, accurately document diagnoses, engage patients between visits and improve billing documentation; provides quality reporting solutions that help providers, practices, and systems measure their practices’ performance and success with value-based programs; and helps our clients navigate complex requirements, improve quality scores and measure performance which in turn, increases their reimbursement and quality earnings.
•Payment Integrity: Employs advanced analytics, AI, and process automation to support improvements in payment integrity for providers, payors and patients; and works with payors to defend against fraud, waste and abuse while helping providers with denial prevention issues.    
•Chronic Condition Intervention: Helps providers identify eligible patients for diabetes and obesity management solutions and other chronic care conditions; and gives providers confidence that these services are covered and billable, as well as the convenience of digital prescriptions integrated into the provider workflow.
•Digital Patient Platform: Consolidates patients’ healthcare data into one place; provides the connectivity to generate care gap reminders that are seamlessly integrated into the patient’s digital healthcare journey.
We generate revenue from our provider clients based on the volume of health document requests and through subscription fees for various technology related services. Subscription fees are recognized ratably over a one- to three-year contractual period with the opportunity to sell additional solutions at any time. 
Life Sciences (formerly Consumer Solutions)
In January 2022, our consumer solutions channel (as referenced in previous filings), was renamed the life sciences channel in order to more accurately portray the customer base of the channel.
Our life sciences offering is a robust platform and suite of digital products and medical expert knowledge that provides members with personalized information, programs, and resources to improve their health and well-being. In support of pharma and other consumer brands, Sharecare drives significant patient engagement across our consumer audiences using a unique library of content. The newest life sciences innovations from Sharecare for 2023 marketing campaigns include Vital Voices, Rare Disease Roadmap, Patient Connect, Inside Out and Care Collective. 
To drive awareness, adoption and engagement on behalf of our partners, we have created a comprehensive strategy to reach the member through a unique mix of member outreach, including social media, search engine optimization and marketing and precision audience targeting. We generate revenue from our life sciences clients through products such as lead generation, sponsorships, audience targeting and condition-specific content.
Our Platform
Our platform begins with RealAge, which is a NCQA-certified health assessment that uses scientifically-based methods to assess a variety of behaviors and existing conditions of our members and provide them with an easily understandable metric for their physical health. With approximately 45 million individuals completing the assessment since its inception in 1998, RealAge delivers immediate results and recommendations about how to improve a member’s health and also identifies behaviors, both positive and negative, that may be impacting it. Using RealAge as a person’s baseline, our algorithms power a data-driven dialogue with the member, creating a content-rich, personalized experience that presents them with relevant benefits programs, resources and providers for those needing healthcare and well-being support. As members change their behavior, the platform refines its predictive analytics to provide increasingly compelling recommendations.
Through our digital platform we are able to gain key insights into each member’s health gleaned from self-reported data, in addition to data from the smartphone, eligibility and claims, social determinants of health, and, in some cases, medical records. This data is then analyzed, with each member’s permission, to recommend personalized resources, tools, information and programs that meet each person where they are in their healthcare journey. Through our platform, members can store and access all their health data in one place, navigate their benefits and access personal family and clinical advocates through our high-touch digital-first advocacy solution Sharecare+. We then provide the resources members need to manage their health through lifestyle or disease management and coaching programs, such as diabetes management and smoking cessation; well-being solutions, such as financial health and anxiety management; and care navigation tools, such as find-a-doctor, prescription savings, clinical decision support and medical records. Our product design philosophy uniquely positions us to drive meaningful engagement while also aggregating a critical mass of behavioral data, to which we apply AI to more accurately personalize recommendations to predict and influence positive outcomes for each individual. We drive AI-based insights to deliver personalized experiences and improved outcomes through extensive and proprietary 360° data on physical, mental, behavioral, financial and community health factors.
Beyond our offerings that focus on individual health and well-being, our platform also provides customized and innovative health data services to provider organizations around the country, helping them become more profitable, productive and secure. Our key product offerings are summarized below, many of which are owned by Sharecare. However, we have adopted an approach of partnering with best-in-class solutions and integrating them into our platform as an additional benefit to our enterprise clients. As a result, some of the digital therapeutics and other tools we offer are subject to agreements and arrangements that we have in place with third-party marketplace solution providers. 
Key Capabilities of Our Flagship Platform
Digital Benefits Navigation. Within the Sharecare platform, benefits navigation provides a centralized location for medical, dental, vision and prescription benefits, medical authorizations, spending accounts and digital wallet. 
Daily Health Tracking. With RealAge as our baseline, we motivate members to engage in their health by tracking their “green days,” the proprietary health currency we use to measure their daily progress towards the 13 critical health factors that impact one’s RealAge the most: weight, stress, smoke, sleep, relationships, medications, fitness, diet, cholesterol, blood pressure, steps, glucose and alcohol. Over time, members are prompted to recalculate their RealAge to see how much they have improved their health.
Engaging Challenges. Designed to impact the core health factors that influence the health and RealAge of our members, our challenges are time-based programs focused on driving engagement throughout the platform. Enterprise clients can create 
customized challenges specifically targeted for their populations and members can track their progress against others in the community via a leaderboard. 
Health Profile. Through our health profile, a personal health record, serving as a living, breathing, evolving story of a member’s health, members can follow their own health journey. Controlled by the member, the health profile is one place for individuals to store and access their biometrics and health data at any time. 
Lifestyle Risk Program. Upon completion of the RealAge test, members can begin participating in the RealAge program, our comprehensive healthy behavior program that targets four main categories of lifestyle risks: stress; sleep; nutrition; and activity personalized to the individual based on risk level for each lifestyle category gleaned through RealAge test responses and stated interests.
Rewards and Incentives. Designed to motivate engagement and drive behavior change that leads to improved health outcomes, we designed our rewards approach based on proven behavioral science principles that drive member engagement. Focusing on strategic activities and rewards that are tailored to the individual and easy to understand, we use personalized content and communications to educate and engage members to sustain participation over time. Reward activities are configurable by population to support key objectives like increased engagement or cost savings. Initial and sustained engagement focused activities are available, as well as those that meet participatory or outcomes-based requirements. 
Symptom checker. AskMD is a personalized health consultation and comprehensive symptom checker that matches member answers against the latest clinical research to help members take ownership of their health and be better informed before visiting the doctor.
Sharecare+ advocacy. Sharecare+ is a digital-first, precision advocacy solution that engages individuals and families in their holistic well-being journey. By providing direct, simplified access to all their benefits and expert high-touch support from professional advocates to easily navigate the full scope of their healthcare needs on their terms, members can more easily and effectively manage their health experience—whether that is a chronic condition, helping address mental health challenges, navigating complex benefits, finding the right doctor, understanding a claim, navigating to the right care, managing overall lifestyle risk, or just learning healthier habits. Seamlessly layered on top of our flagship digital engagement platform, Sharecare+ is designed to help health plans and self-insured employers increase efficiency, productivity, and quality, and reduce cost of care while making members and employees and their families happier, healthier, and more productive. Sharecare+ and our advocates help members find what they need, when they need it.
Digital Therapeutics Marketplace
An array of value-added proprietary and partner-powered solutions that integrate directly into our flagship platform are available for enterprise and provider clients to purchase for their populations.
Behavioral Health. Beyond the free content and resources available through the Sharecare platform to help people address a range of behavioral health challenges, including guided meditation and relaxation exercises, we offer several digital therapeutics to aid in anxiety and stress management, tobacco and vaping cessation and overeating that consumers may purchase directly or enterprise clients can “unlock” and sponsor for those in their own populations.
Diabetes. As the first end-to-end turnkey diabetes care and glycemic management program for health systems and physician groups, we integrate personalized high-touch interventions with high-tech products to improve the management of people living with diabetes across the care continuum. Our proprietary content, developed by clinical and operations specialists, is designed to ensure patient and professional education adhere to the latest standards of care and evidenced-based best practices and is coupled with FDA-cleared digital therapeutics for diabetes management optimization. 
Disease Management. Using a combination of advanced disease algorithms and proprietary predictive risk models, we analyze medical and pharmacy claims, procedure and eligibility data to appropriately identify individuals with primary chronic conditions, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Individuals who are currently, or at near-term risk of, high healthcare utilization are then targeted for proactive outreach and intervention through the Sharecare platform.
Heart Disease. The first and only program scientifically proven to reverse the progression of heart disease, Ornish Lifestyle Medicine focuses on four key areas: eating; stress; love and support; and activity. We provide a multi-platform approach to train and certify health systems in effectively providing the Ornish Lifestyle Medicine program to their patients. 
Lifestyle Coaching. We actively target and engage individuals who are at risk for developing a condition and, through the support of a personal coach, teach them how to take healthy steps to change behavior. Personalized to the participant, the 
program is designed to address areas that contribute to overall physical health and well-being, such as exercise, healthy eating, stress management, tobacco cessation, and weight management.
Digital Therapeutics Through Partnership. In addition to our owned digital therapeutics, we utilize partnerships to enhance our offerings on our platform through a seamless member experience. For example, we currently partner to bring a suite of applications that support women and their partners throughout the parenthood journey including fertility, pregnancy and parenting. In addition, while our platform already includes assessments, educational content, and tools to help members take action to mitigate financial stress and step into financial wellness, we also offer members access to SmartDollar, a leading online financial wellness solution that helps people get on a budget, save for emergencies, pay off debt, and save for retirement. Through partnership we can also help enterprise clients deliver their populations an evidence-based solution for preventing and improving musculoskeletal issues. 
Get Active. Sharecare recently launched Get Active, a new program to help employers encourage exercise among their workforces in a fun, approachable, and accessible way, using the immersive power of virtual reality (VR). In a pilot with its customer Lennar Corporation, one of the nation’s leading homebuilders, Sharecare’s Get Active program for Meta Quest 2 yielded strong engagement and significant increases in average weekly exercise minutes compared to pre-program for both healthy and high-risk participants.
Community-Driven Care Solutions
At Sharecare, just as we are guided by our mission to help every person — no matter where they are in their health journey — live longer, better, we also are fiercely committed to ensuring the healthy choice is the easy choice across the places where people work, live, play and stay. 
Blue Zones Project. Our Blue Zones Project is a community well-being improvement initiative in partnership with Adventist Health designed to change the way people experience the world around them by encouraging and promoting better lifestyle choices, such as commuting, eating and social habits. Because healthier environments naturally nudge people toward healthier choices, Blue Zones Project focuses on influencing the Life Radius®, the area close to home in which people spend 90% of their lives. Our 75 communities across 15 states have populations with greater well-being, improved health outcomes, reduced costs, and increased civic pride, all of which support healthy economic development.
Community Well-Being Index. Based on over 4 million surveys and more than 600 elements of social determinants of health data, our Community Well-Being Index (“CWBI”) serves as the definitive measure of community well-being across and within populations. A collaboration between Sharecare and the Boston University School of Public Health, CWBI combines individual risk derived from the Well-Being Index with community risk from the Social Determinants of Health Index to create a single composite measure that defines our collective health risk and opportunities. 
Our data and insights on well-being inform more effective strategies that encourage the sustained lifestyle changes necessary for people to thrive and perform to their highest potential. For employers, health plans, health systems and community leaders, this holistic view of health provides the framework for understanding the underlying root causes of poor health, enabling hyper-targeted interventions that make the healthy choice the easy choice.
CareLinx: Home Care and Nurse OnDemand
Powered by its network of over 500,000 background-checked, tech-enabled caregivers, CareLinx by Sharecare delivers intermittent on-demand personal care services in people’s homes, while leveraging mobile technology to facilitate rich data capture, population health analytics, and the enabling of real-time care coordination with remote clinical teams. CareLinx provides services across the continuum of care, including non-medical, companionship and housework, and personal and clinical care. In addition to supporting members with Activities of Daily Living (“ADL”) such as bathing, dressing, grooming, meal preparation, light housekeeping, and more, CareLinx’s professional caregivers also help to identify risks or needed resources in the home – from food insecurity to unhealthy living conditions. Through comprehensive and seamless data integration with health plans, CareLinx by Sharecare assists members in closing gaps in care while supporting chronic condition management, care coordination, and transitional care management to reduce readmissions and help members remain healthy at home longer.
CareLinx, through Nurse OnDemand, leverages our established nationwide network of tech-enabled nursing professionals for on-demand dispatch and medical staffing to better serve patients wherever they are, at-home or within healthcare facilities. Our nurses leverage technology that facilitates patient health data capture, population health analytics and the enabling of real time care coordination with remote clinical teams.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization and through partner relationships. Our direct sales team is comprised of sales professionals organized into one of three channels: enterprise; provider; and life sciences. Within each of these categories, our direct sales team is organized principally by channel, geography, segments, and/or account size. Our enterprise and provider contracts range in length from one to five-year terms with most renewing automatically, and typically subject to cancellation by either party upon 90 days’ notice prior to the renewal date. These agreements contain standard commercial terms and conditions, including payment terms, billing frequency, and indemnification. The sales cycle for our solutions from initial contact with a potential client to client launch is difficult to predict and varies widely by client and segment, ranging from less than six months to well over a year.
Our Technology
Our “flagship” platform includes a single mobile application available on iOS, Android and the web as well as a suite of infrastructure and business services hosted in the Amazon Web Services, or AWS, cloud.
Designed as a mobile-first, scalable, configurable and easy to operate platform, we are purpose-built with enterprise-grade framework, uptime guarantees, processes, and organizational structures; and optimized for developing new services and features, change management, incident management, management of services, members and clients, and new client implementations.
To provide high levels of availability and enhance security, our system designs involve redundant subsystems and compartmentalized networks. To ensure compliance with privacy and security regulations as well as our obligations to our clients and members, we implement industry-standard processes and technical controls from software development to deployment and network administration, including regularly scheduled vulnerability scans and third-party penetration testing to reduce security risks in our system. On an annual basis, we also undergo independent, third-party ISO27001, HITRUST, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and SSAE 16 audits. Our systems are continuously monitored to ensure availability and we have institutionalized problem escalation and incidence management mechanisms.
Competition
Our primary competitors in the digital healthcare industry are other health tech companies that serve the needs of members across a broad set of health-related needs and are not limited to a single demographic. These digital health companies generally fall into one or more of the following platform types:
•Wellness/Well-being platforms that provide a range of solutions to support the wellness/well-being of their members, including health risk assessments, incentive administration, coaching and support programs for lifestyle and disease management, biometric screening, health and wellness challenges and activity tracking and other health-related content.
•Benefits Navigation platforms that provide solutions to help members navigate their health benefits programs, including solutions that integrate third party benefits information, tools for managing health spending accounts and other digital wallet offerings, guided benefits enrollment and other communications tools to make navigation of benefits more accessible for members.
•Health Navigation platforms that provide offerings to help members navigate their personal healthcare journey, including health concierge and advocacy services, home care, coordination of care and decision support, and solutions to help members access care, ensure price transparency and provide claims-driven personalization.
We also face competition from many other vendors in the digital healthcare space offering point solutions addressing only one specific aspect of a person’s health. These point solutions may either be offered on a standalone basis or incorporated into larger digital healthcare platforms, like us, through partnership arrangements. We expect to face increasing competition, both from current competitors, who may be well established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into our market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to be and remain intense. 
Employees and Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,485 employees worldwide, including approximately 309 nurses, clinicians and health coaches, as well as contract and part-time employees who are working less than 40 hours a week. Of our total employees, 2,530 reside in the United States and 955 in other countries, such as Brazil, France, Germany, India, and the Philippines. None of our employees are unionized or members of collective bargaining arrangements, other than our employees in Brazil that are 
members of a collective bargaining agreement as required under Brazilian law. We believe our strong employee base, along with their commitment to our culture and uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our Company’s success.
The attraction, retention, and development of talented colleagues is critical to our success. We accomplish this, in part, by developing our team members through learning, development and performance management programs. These programs include consistent new hire onboarding, new manager training, structured goal setting and annual performance management review processes as well as other customized approaches to development at the team or individual levels.
Our employees are responsible for supporting our ultimate goal of connecting doctors, health plans, employers, useful tools, and quality information to deliver robust solutions in an easy-to-use platform. We recognize that every employee has the opportunity to make a difference, and we have developed skill and competencies expectations to support them in meeting their full potential. In addition to their individual performance goals, our team members are measured annually in areas of communication, change management, problem solving, decision making, and conflict resolution, as well as in their ability to drive results, coach others, build trust, and act as an effective team member.
To keep our leadership team informed of the needs of our human capital assets, we track and report internally on key metrics including headcounts by functional area, onboarding experiences, colleague engagement levels and exit data.
We continue to vet and hone our organizational structure as our business evolves and accordingly, we establish new roles as needed to reflect the talent and capabilities required by our business.
Our human capital practices are governed by various federal, state and local regulations. We monitor key employment activities, such as hiring, termination and pay practices to ensure compliance with established regulations across the world.
Diversity
Our diversity, equity, and inclusion objective is to be a company where each individual in our organization genuinely belongs, is respected and valued and can do their best work. We embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. To attract a diverse workforce, we strive to embed a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work.
As of December 31, 2022, our workforce was comprised of female — 71%, minority — 36%, disability — 4%, and veterans — 2%. Our Executive Team of 24 included eight females and four minorities as of December 31, 2022. Our Medical Advisory Board of 20 included eight females and two minorities as of December 31, 2022. With our diversity recruiting initiatives we expect that we will increase our workforce diversity, and advance inclusion and equity within all Sharecare divisions to create future opportunities for all colleagues.
Safety
The safety and well-being of our employees is always our top priority and a primary focus of our leaders. All policies and procedures related to safety are reviewed and acknowledged by colleagues annually.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on protecting the health and safety of our team members while meeting the needs of our clients. Within weeks of the start of COVID-19 pandemic, we moved approximately 90% of our office-based team members to a work-from-home model with minimal impact to productivity. We immediately created, and have continuously evaluated and amended, protocols and guidelines to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We continue to provide flexibility to our team members to work from home and make decisions appropriate for their circumstances. 
Benefits
Our compensation program is based on our philosophy that total compensation should support the Company’s mission and values. We believe our compensation program is a management tool that when aligned with an effective communication plan, is designed to support, reinforce and align our values, business strategy, and operational and financial needs with a goal of growth and profitability. The program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain talented colleagues who are dedicated to the success of the organization.
In recognition of the need to employ top-tier talent, we strive to provide base salaries that meet or exceed the market for colleagues who are fully proficient and meeting expectations. The Company utilizes incentive or variable pay as a way to meet the strategic goals of the Company. Incentive pay is available to some colleagues with consideration of a number of factors and is based on individual goals that relate to company objectives as well as overall company performance. The compensation process is intended to be fair and simple so that all employees and managers understand the goals and the outcomes of the process. We are committed to administering the compensation program in a manner that is consistent and free of discrimination.
As a part of our total rewards offerings, we offer competitive benefits, evidenced-based programs and wellness tools to assist our employees in making the right choices every day, representing our commitment to employee health and wellness. We provide health, welfare and retirement benefits for our employees, including medical, health savings account (“HSA”) grants, dental, vision, life insurance, short- and long-term disability, paid time off, various voluntary insurance programs, tuition reimbursement, a robust employee assistance program (“EAP”), and a 401(k) retirement plan. Our offerings are designed to enhance employee productivity and loyalty by giving our team members the tools they need to live their healthiest, happiest, and most productive lives. As a leader in digital healthcare, we have also partnered with innovators to offer added tools that address specific aspects of personal and financial health.
Training
We continue to emphasize employee development and training. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills and resources. Our Learning Management System platform supplements our talent development strategies through an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses.
We have all-company competencies focused on individual contributors to front-line managers to senior managers. These competencies focus on how we coach others, drive results, problem solve and make decisions, resolve conflict, build trust, build effective teams, manage change and communicate. We believe these behavioral expectations are integrated into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance and develop our people.
We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our next generation leaders. For colleagues who have been promoted or hired as a people manager, we conduct New Manager Essentials training within 30-60 days. This training focuses on human resource laws and regulations, wage and hour standards for hourly workers, approving timecards, basics of interviewing, such as what you can and cannot ask, performance management as a manager including managing the performance improvement plan process, and transitioning from a peer to a manager.
For our mid-level leaders, we conduct a multi-day program that continues to support our key competencies such as team building, coaching with emotional intelligence, leading through transition and change, communicating appropriately, and managing difficult situations. To supplement our leader development programs we provide a quarterly newsletter developed in-house that is focused on current topics pertinent to our business.
We partnered with LinkedIn Learning to allow colleagues to develop in their current role by expanding their knowledge in areas of interest. Additionally, we have internal training courses on topics such as: critical conversations; managing a remote workforce; how to give and receive feedback; conducting interviews; time management/prioritization; setting performance management goals; and coaching to those goals. Utilizing the experience of our own colleagues, we also have a mentoring program in place for some of our operations.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality agreements and other similar agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that the overall significance to our business is minimal, and that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 64 registered trademarks in the U.S. and also held 112 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we owned a number of copyrights and registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.sharecare.com.
As of December 31, 2022, we also owned a portfolio of (a) 12 issued patents and (b) 25 pending patent applications in the U.S. In foreign jurisdictions, we had four patent applications and no issued patents as of December 31, 2022. As noted below, we believe that the impact of our patent portfolio is relatively minimal (with the exception of the doc.ai patent applications discussed below), and that our current solutions and revenue are driven primarily by our brands (including our registered trademarks), along with our knowledge and trade secrets.
We have historically acquired a substantial portion of our intellectual property through acquisitions. Nearly all of our issued patents were acquired through our acquisition of the Population Health business of Healthways in 2016 and consist of patents for various automated medical diagnostic and treatment advice systems, disease management systems, panel diagnostic systems and an end-of-life predictive model. The patents acquired from Healthways expire between 2023 and 2030 and we do not believe any of them to be integral to the functionality of our existing solutions.
One pending patent application was acquired through our acquisition of MindSciences and relates to behavior change user interface response. Similar to the Healthways patents discussed above, we do not believe this patent application to be integral to the functionality of any of our existing solutions.
In connection with our acquisition of doc.ai, we further enhanced our intellectual property portfolio with the acquisition of a portfolio comprising of one issued patent, 25 patent applications (including applications in the U.S., China, and Japan) and three trademark registrations/applications in the U.S. doc.ai’s patent applications consist of applications with respect to software and AI in the healthcare field and expire between April 2037 and October 2040.
More so than patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information by, in part, entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees and other partners. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that we have executed such agreements with all of employees and other partners, or that to the extent an agreement is in place, it will not be breached or will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For additional information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters — Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Licensing and Collaboration Agreements
We have historically leveraged, and intend to continue to leverage, licensing and other third-party collaboration agreements in order to expand and enhance the suite of solutions we are able to offer to our clients and members.
For example, we have entered into a license and/or collaboration agreement with respect to each of the digital therapeutic solutions provided through our suite of marketplace solutions that are integrated into our platform as discussed under “Our Platform — Digital Therapeutics Marketplace.” Although each marketplace solution that is integrated into our platform provides an opportunity for our members to meet their healthcare needs for a particular set of health issues, these marketplace solutions together accounted for less than 5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and we do not believe any single marketplace solutions is critical to our platform. Moreover, we intend our suite of marketplace solutions to evolve over time as healthcare needs change. As a result, we expect to periodically pivot to additional or replacement marketplace solutions (or to develop our own solution alternatives) as existing marketplace solutions become obsolete or otherwise fail to meet the evolving needs of our members.
In addition to licensing and/or collaboration agreements with respect to our suite of marketplace solutions, certain of our other offerings are subject to licensing agreements, such as our Blue Zones Project initiative in partnership with Adventist Health. We also license various software and services from third-party providers in connection with the operation of our platform and business. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Technology and Data Privacy — We rely on internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, third-party computer hardware and software, and other third parties for providing services to our clients and members, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or the inability to access our platform on third-party operating systems could negatively impact our relationships with clients and members, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Regulatory Matters
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. Specifically, our solutions are subject to extensive regulation covering the privacy and security of personal health information. Because maintaining the safety of our platform and keeping personal information secure and confidential are our most important responsibilities as a healthcare company, we have structured our operations with a focus on compliance. We continue to monitor and respond to changes in the regulatory landscape, however, there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by such changes.
HIPAA and Other Privacy and Security Requirements
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information, particularly protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of PHI and requires the implementation of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI. We are regulated as both a business associate and covered entity under HIPAA. In addition to HIPAA, some states in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information, including health information. Such state laws can be similar to or even more protective than HIPAA, in which case we must comply with the more stringent law. We also may become increasingly subject to foreign laws governing 
the privacy and security of personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) as we continue to expand our business internationally. As a result, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations in order to ensure we are in compliance with the stricter state or foreign laws.
In order to comply with the requirements of HIPAA and other similar state laws, we have implemented safeguards to protect our members’ PHI, including storing and transmitting PHI securely in compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule, utilizing the minimum data necessary to provide any particular service, restricting the use and sharing of PHI, limiting access to PHI to authorized personnel, maintaining training programs on how to protect PHI and ensuring business associate agreements and data sharing agreements are in place with the appropriate parties.
Data Protection and Breaches
In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper disclosure of individuals’ PHI or other personal information. Certain states have reacted to these breaches by enacting laws and regulations requiring holders of such information to take additional steps, including responding to breaches in certain timeframes, to safeguard the information. While HIPAA requires us to report breaches of unsecured PHI to our clients no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach, our own compliance standards and the terms of our contractual agreements require earlier reporting of any such breach. We are also required to notify the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and, in cases involving large breaches, the media.
In addition to the HIPAA compliance measures discussed above, we de-identify, encrypt and back up data, maintain company-wide security awareness training, enter into business associate agreements with our partners, as well as ensure our partners have implemented physical security and safeguards at the data centers where our data is stored and conduct regular internal and external security audits. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters — Our use, disclosure, and other processing of PII and PHI is subject to HIPAA and other federal, state, and foreign privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our client base, member base, and revenue.”
Other Healthcare Regulations
In addition to data privacy laws, our operations and arrangements with healthcare professionals, clients and third-party payors may subject us to various federal, state, and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, including without limitation, fraud and abuse laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; civil and criminal false claims laws; physician transparency laws; and state laws regarding the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting prohibitions. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing operations, and our interactions with healthcare professionals. Although we have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these healthcare laws and regulations, failure to maintain compliance could result in significant penalties and require changes in our business operations.
International Operations
We have international operations in Brazil and France that provide health and wellness services to corporate and health insurer clients. In Brazil, we have a 10 year joint venture agreement with SulAmerica (“SAS”), one of the largest insurance companies in the country, under which we provide services to SAS and other third-party clients. Services are delivered via our platform and local contact centers, including nursing and lifestyle management outreach for disease management, senior programs, coaching, and inbound nurse triage call lines. In France, we provide a tobacco cessation offering to a health insurer population. We may, in the future, expand our international operations as opportunities become available.
