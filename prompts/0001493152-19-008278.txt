ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
DSG Global Inc. (formerly Boreal Productions Inc.) (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 24, 2007. Andrea Fehsenfeld was then appointed sole officer and director. The Company was formed to option feature films and TV projects and then package them to sell at a profit to various studios and production companies. The Company is currently a technology development company engaged in the design, manufacture, and marketing of fleet management solutions in the golf industry. The Company’s principal activities are the sale and rental of GPS tracking devices and interfaces for golf vehicles and related support services.


At that time the board of directors voted to seek capital and begin development of our business plan. We received our initial funding of $9,000 through the sale of common stock to Ms. Fehsenfeld who purchased 3,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock at $0.003 per share and $45,000 from the sale of 3,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock issued to 30 un-affiliated investors at $0.015 per share. On June 11, 2008, we effected a five for one forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 375,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock and our outstanding share capital increased from 6,000,000 shares of pre-reverse split common stock to 30,000,000 shares of pre-reverse split common stock.
 
We have not achieved revenues and have accrued a net loss of $153,964 since inception through May 6, 2015, the date of the reverse merger. We have been issued a going concern opinion by our auditors and rely upon the sale of our securities to fund operations. To date, we have been unable to attain profitable operations and continue to be dependent upon continued financial support from our shareholders and note holders in order to continue operations.
 
On April 13, 2015, we entered into a share exchange agreement with DSG Tag Systems Inc. (“DSG TAG”) and the shareholders of DSG TAG who become parties to the share exchange agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, we agreed to acquire not less than 75% and up to 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of DSG TAG’s common stock in exchange for the issuance by our company of up to 20,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock to the shareholders of DSG TAG on the basis of one of our pre-reverse split common shares for 5.4935 common shares of DSG TAG.
 
Previously, in anticipation of the share exchange agreement with DSG TAG, we undertook to change our name and effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued common stock. Accordingly, on January 19, 2015, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary DSG Global Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Boreal Productions Inc. to DSG Global Inc. Our company remains the surviving company. DSG Global Inc. was formed solely for the change of name.
 
Also on January 19, 2015, our company’s board of directors approved a resolution to effect a reverse stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a three (3) old for one (1) new basis. Upon effect of the reverse split, our authorized capital will decrease from 375,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock to 125,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease from 30,000,000 to 10,000,000 pre-reverse split shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001.
 
Articles of Merger to effect the merger and change of name and a Certificate of Change to effect the reverse stock split were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 22, 2015, with an effective date of February 2, 2015. The name change and forward split were reviewed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) were approved for filing with an effective date of February 23, 2015.
 
The name change became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and OTC Markets quotation system at the opening of trading on February 23, 2015 under the symbol “BRPOD”. Effective March 19, 2015 our stock symbol changed to “DSGT”. Our new CUSIP number following the symbol change is 23340C104. The first trade of our common shares occurred on March 25, 2015.

On May 6, 2015, we completed the acquisition of approximately 75% (82,435,748 common shares) of the issued and outstanding common shares of DSG TAG as contemplated by the share exchange agreement by issuing 15,185,875 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock to shareholders of DSG TAG who became parties to the agreement. In addition, concurrent with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued an additional 179,823 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock to Westergaard Holdings Ltd. in partial settlement of accrued interest on outstanding indebtedness of DSG TAG.
 
Following the initial closing of the share exchange agreement and through October 22, 2015, we acquired an additional 101,200 shares of common stock of DSG TAG from shareholders who became parties to the share exchange agreement and issued to these shareholders an aggregate of 18,422 pre-reverse split shares of our common stock. Following completion of these additional purchases, DSG Global Inc. owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of DSG TAG.
 
The reverse acquisition was accounted for as a recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein DSG TAG is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. We adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG upon the closing of the share exchange agreement.


Subsequent to the closing of the share exchange agreement with DSG TAG, we adopted the business and operations of DSG TAG.


DSG TAG was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 17, 2008 and extra provincially registered in British Columbia, Canada in 2008.

DSG Technologies and Products
 
Technology Overview
 
DSG produces a “modular” suite of products to provide fleet management solution for any vehicle required for a golf operation and provides two golfer information display options to meet the operators budget requirements. DSG believes that it is currently the only company in the golf fleet management industry with these capabilities.
 
The DSG TAG System is designed from the ground up to be a golf/turf vehicle fleet management system. Its main function is addressing the golf course operator needs. While employing same core technology (cellular wireless and GPS) as traditional commercial vehicle fleet management systems, DSG has created patent pending solutions to adapt it to the very specific requirements of the golf environment. Compared to mainstream fleet tracking products, DSG collects 10 to 50 times more data points per MB (megabyte) of cellular data due to its proprietary data collection and compression algorithms. Also the relative positioning accuracy is improved by almost one order of magnitude by the use of application-specific geo-data validation and correction methods.
 
DSG’s proprietary methods make it possible to offer a solution suitable for use on golf courses at a price low enough to be affordable in the industry. Every system component incorporates state-of-the-art technology (server, mobile trackers, display). In developing its products, DSG TAG has adopted an application oriented approach placing the most emphasis (and research & development) on server and end-user software by taking advantage of the commodity level reached by mainstream technologies such as Global Positioning (GPS) and M2M (Machine to Machine) Cellular Data in the wider context of Commercial Fleet Management.
 
DSG leveraged the existence of an abundance of very cost effective telematics solutions by selecting an “off-the-shelf” hardware platform that meets all the main performance and environmental requirements for operation in the harsh, outdoor golf course environment. While removing all risk and cost associated with developing a proprietary hardware platform, DSG has maintained the unique nature of its hardware solution by developing a set of proprietary adapters and interfaces specifically for the golf application.
 
DSG has secured an exclusive supply agreement with the third-party hardware manufacturers for the vertical of golf industry. Additionally, DSG owns the design of all proprietary adapters and interfaces. This removes the risk of a potential competitor utilizing the same hardware platform. Competitors could attempt to reverse engineer or copycat the TAG technology and equipment. This risk factor is mitigated by the fact that our product does not rely on a particular technology or hardware platform to be successful but on a very specific vertical software application that is far more difficult to copy (and respectively easier to protect).
 
The application software contains patent features implemented in every core component of the system. The TAG device runs DSG proprietary firmware incorporating unique data collection and compression algorithms. The web server software which powers the end-user application is also proprietary and incorporates the industry knowledge accumulated through the over 70 years of collective experience of the DSG team.
 
This approach has given the product line a high level of endurance against technology obsolescence. At any point in time, if a hardware component is discontinued or a better/less expensive hardware platform becomes available, the software application can be easily adapted to operate on the new platform or with the new component. The Company benefits from the constant increase of performance and cost reduction of mainstream hardware technology without any additional cost.
 
The web-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model used by DSG TAG is optimal for low operating and support costs and rapid-cycle release for software updates. It is also a major factor in eliminating or substantially reducing the need for any end-user premises equipment. Customers have access to the service through any internet connected computer or mobile device, there is no need for a local wireless network on the facility and installation time and cost are minimal.


DSG is positioned to take advantage of mainstream technology and utilize “best of breed” hardware platforms to create new generations of products. Our software is designed to be “portable” to future new platforms with better GPS and wireless technology in order to maintain the Company competitive edge.
 
All new product development effort of DSG is following the same model: select the best of breed third-party hardware platform, design and produce custom proprietary accessories while focusing the bulk of the development efforts on vertical software application to address a very specific set of end-customer needs.

The latest addition to the TAG family of products, the TAG TOUCH is a perfect example of this development philosophy in action: the main component is a last-generation Android tablet PC wrapped in a custom designed outdoor enclosure containing the power supply and interface components required for the golf environment. The software application is taking advantage of all the advanced high resolution graphics, touch user interface and computing power of the Android OS delivering a vastly superior user experience compared to competitive systems. The time to market for this product was 30% of how long it took to develop and launch this type of products in the past.
 
The TAG Control Unit
 
The Company’s flagship product is the TAG Control unit. The TAG Control unit can operate as a “stand alone” unit or with one of two displays; the TEXT alphanumeric display or the TOUCH high definition “touch activated” screen. The TAG Control unit is GPS enabled and communicates with the TAG software using cellular GSM networks. Utilizing the cellular networks rather than erecting a local Wi-Fi network assures carrier grade uptime, and vehicle tracking “off- property”. GSM is the de facto global standard for mobile communications.


The TAG Control unit itself is discreetly installed usually in the nose of the vehicle to give the GPS clear line of site. It is then connected to the vehicle battery and ignition. The property is then mapped using the latest satellite imagery that is graphically enhanced and loaded into the TAG System as a map.
 
Once installed the vehicle owner utilizes the TAG software to locate the vehicle in real time using any computer, smartphone, or tablet that has an internet connection and perform various management operations.
 

The operator can use the geo-fencing capabilities to create “zones” on the property where they can control the vehicles behavior such as shutting down a vehicle that is entering a sensitive or dangerous area. The TAG System also monitors the strength of the vehicle’s battery helping to prevent sending out vehicles undercharged batteries which can be an inconvenience for the course and negatively impact the golfer experience.

DSG has developed proprietary “Ad Manager” software which is used to place and change the ads on the system(s) from a central NOC (Network Operations Center) in real time. The Ad Manager can deploy to a single system or multiple systems. This creates a network of screens that is also very desirable to advertisers as ad content can be deployed locally, regionally, or nationally. The advertising platform is an important part of the Company’s future marketing and sales strategy.
 

DSG R3 Advertising Platform
 
The DSG R3 program delivers advance ROI (Revenue Optimization Intelligence). Utilizing all streams of advertising delivery, such as automated, direct, and self-serve. The R3 program has the ability to deliver relevant advertising to golfers the moment they sit in the cart. The R3 model is more effective than the previous advertising model of ‘One to One’, these are local ads only sold through direct sales by courses, or 3rd party advertising sales firms. The new R3 model offers ‘Many to one’ advertising options, delivering thousands of national, regional, and local advertisers an opportunity to advertise on our screens through our R3 Marketplace.

TAG TURF/ECO TAG
 
The TAG Turf and the new ECO TAG were developed to give course operators the same back end management features for their turf equipment and utility vehicles. Turf equipment is expensive and a single piece can run over $100,000 and represents a large portion of a golf course operating budget. The TAG Turf and ECO TAG have comprehensive reporting that the operator can utilize to implement programs that can increase efficiencies, reduce labor costs, help lower idle times, provide fuel consumption and equipment performance, provide historical data on cutting patterns, and reduce pollution from emissions by monitoring idle times. Since the golf course needs to be maintained regardless of volume these cost saving measures directly impact the operator’s bottom line.
Features and Benefits
 

● | Can be installed on any turf, utility, or service vehicle 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Work activity tracking and management 
● | Work breakdown and analysis per area, work group, activity type or specific vehicle 
● | Vehicle idling alerts 
● | Zone entry alerts 
● | Detailed travel (cutting patterns) history 
● | Detailed usage reports with mileage and hours 
● | Protection for ecological areas through geo fencing 
● | Vehicle lock down and ‘off property’ locating features

Revenue Model
 
DSG derives revenue from four different sources.
 
Systems Sales Revenue, which consists of the sales price paid by those customers who purchase our TAG system hardware.
 
Monthly Service Fees are paid by all customers for the wireless data fee charges required to operate the GPS tracking on the TAG systems.
 
Monthly Rental Fees are paid by those customers that rent the TAG system hardware. The amount of a customer’s monthly payment varies based on the type of equipment rented (a TAG, a TAG and TEXT, or a TAG and TOUCH).
 
Advertising Revenue is a source of revenue that has not been taken full advantage of. We believe it has the potential to be strategic for us in the future. Currently, courses can deliver their own advertising to our TOUCH units and soon we’ll be introducing our R3 program which automates the delivery of advertising.
 
Markets
 
Sales and Marketing Plan
 
The market for the TAG System is the worldwide golf cart and Turf equipment fleets. There are 40,000 golf courses around the world with North America being the largest individual market with 20,000. This represents over 3,000,000 vehicles. The golf market has five distinct types of operations. Municipal, Private Country Clubs, Destination Resorts, Public Commercial, Military and University affiliated. DSG has deployed and has case studies developed TAG systems in each of these categories.
 
Our marketing strategy is focused on building brand awareness, generating quality leads, and providing excellent customer service.

North America Sales
 
Since the largest market is North America the Company employs a direct sales team and sales agents that provide full sales coverage. Our sales agents are experienced golf industry professionals who maintain established relationships with the golf industry and carry multiple golf lines. Our sales objective is to offer our existing and prospective customers a dedicated, knowledgeable, and outstanding customer service team.
 
In addition, our team is dedicated to existing accounts that focus on up-selling and cross-selling additional products to our current customer base, securing renewal agreements, and providing excellent customer service. The current regions are:
 

● | Western Canada 
--+---------------------
● | Eastern Canada 
● | Northeast USA 
● | Western USA 
● | Southeastern USA 
● | Midwest USA 

International Sales
 
DSG focuses on select global golf markets that offer significant volume opportunities and that value the benefits that our products deliver.
 
We utilize strategic distributor partnerships in each targeted region/country to sell, install and service our products. Distributors are selected based on market strength, market share, technical and selling capability, and overall reputation. We believe that DSG solutions appeal to all distributors because they are universal and fit any make or model of vehicle. We maintain and leverage our strong relationship with Yamaha, E-Z-GO and Ransomes Jacobsen (sister company to E-Z-GO) in developing our distributor network around the world. Today, many of our distributor partners are the leading distributors for E-Z-GO and RJ and hold a dominant position in their respective markets. While they are Yamaha or E-Z-GO distributors, most sell DSG products to all courses regardless of their choice of golf car as a value add to their customers and to generate additional revenue. We complement this distributor base with independent distributors as needed to ensure we have sufficient coverage in critical markets.
 
Currently DSG is focused on expanding in Europe, Asia and South Africa. The Company is looking to expand next into Australia and Latin America.
 
Management Companies
 
Many golf facilities are managed by management companies. The portfolios of these companies vary from a few to hundreds of golf courses. Troon®, the world’s largest player in golf course management, has over 200 courses under management. The management companies provide everything from branding, staffing, management systems, marketing, and procurement. DSG is currently providing products and services to Troon, OB Sports, Kemper Sports, Trump, Marriott Golf, Blue Green, Crown Golf, American Golf, Billy Casper, Club Corp, and Club Link.
 
DSG has been successful in completing installations and developing relationships with several of the key players who control a substantial number of courses. DSG will continue to implement system developments that are driven by the needs of these management companies such as combined reporting, multiple course access through a centralized dashboard. This development will become a competitive advantage for DSG in the management company market.
 
DSG has dedicated a team to create specific collateral for this market and has assigned a senior executive to have direct responsibility to manage these relationships.

Competition
 
We compete with a number of established producers and distributors of vehicle fleet management systems. Our competitors include producers of golf specific applications, such as GPS Industries, LLC., one of the leading suppliers of golf cart fleet management systems, as well as producers of non-golf specific utility vehicle fleet management systems, such as Toro. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, better brand recognition and greater financial resources than we do. In order for us to successfully compete in our industry we must:

● | demonstrate our products’ competitive advantages; 
--+------------------------------------------------------
● | develop a comprehensive marketing system; and 
● | increase our financial resources. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry.
 
We believe that we will be able to compete effectively in our industry because of the versatility, reliability, and relative affordability of our products when compared to those of our competitors. We will attempt to build awareness of our competitive advantages among existing and potential customers through trade shows, sales visits and demonstrations, online marketing, and positive word of mouth advertising.
 
However, as we are a newly-established company relative to our competitors, we face the same problems as other new companies starting up in an industry, such as limited access to capital. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of research, operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.


Our primary competitor in the field of golf course fleet management is GPS Industries, a company that was founded in 1996 by Mr. Bob Silzer, the founder of DSG TAG Systems Inc. GPS Industries is currently the largest player in the marketplace with an installed base of approximately 750 golf courses worldwide. GPS Industries was consolidated by various mergers and acquisitions with a diversity of hardware platforms and application software. Since 2009, when GPS Industries has introduced their latest product offering called the Visage, in an exclusive partnership with Club Car, their strategy has been to target mostly their existing customers and motivate them into replacing their existing, older GPS system, with the Visage system.
 
GPS Industries is leveraging very heavily their partnership with Club Car, which is one of the three largest golf cars manufacturers in the world and at times is benefiting from golf operators’ preference for Club Car and their vehicles when they select their management system.
 
Market Mix
 
Since the introduction of the DSG product line, the golf course operators realized that they have now access to a budget-friendly fleet management tool that works not only on golf cars but also with all other vehicles used on the golf course such as turf maintenance, shuttles, and other utility vehicles.
 
Marketing studies have identified that half of the golf course operators only need a fleet management system and only 15% need a high-end GPS golf system. This illustrates the strong competitive advantage that DSG TAG Systems has versus GPS Industries since their product can only address the needs of a relatively small fraction of the marketplace.
 

16
--


Consequently, GPS Industries installed base has steadily declined since most of their new product installations have replaced older product for existing customers and some customers have opted for a lower budget system and switched over to DSG TAG Systems.
 
Marketing Activities
 
The Company has a multi layered approach marketing the TAG suite of products. One of the foundations of this plan is attending industry trade shows which are well attended by golf operators. The two largest shows are the PGA Merchandise Show and the Golf Industry Show which are held in Florida at the end of January. The Company also attends a number of regional shows around North America. International events are attended by our distributors and partners.
 
The second layer is memberships in key organizations such as the National Golf Course Owners Association, Golf Course Superintendents Association, and Club Managers Association of America. These are very influential in the industry and have marketing channels such as publications, email blasts, and web based marketing. The Company also markets directly to course operators through email, surveys direct mail programs.


Lead Generation
 
One of the primary sources of lead generation is through the Company’s strategic partnerships with EZ-GO, Yamaha, and Ransomes Jacobson. These relationships provide the Company with a great deal of market intelligence. The sales forces of the partners work in tandem with the DSG sales team by passing on the leads, creating joint proposals, and distributing TAG sales material. The Company has also created co-branded materials for specific value items of interest to operators such as Pace of Play solutions. DSG sale s and marketing staff attend partner sales events to conduct training and discuss marketing strategies.
 
The Company is in the process of testing an internal telemarketing program in several key markets to gauge whether this particular channel warrants larger scale implementation.

Product Supply Chain
 
In order to maintain high product quality and control, as well as benefiting from cost savings, the Company is currently procuring all main hardware components offshore. Final assembly is locally performed in order to ensure product quality. Other main components are also procured directly from manufacturers or from local suppliers that outsource components office in order to keep the price as low as possible.
 
The Company is requesting the suppliers to perform a complete set of quality testing and minimum 24 hours’ burn-in before the product is delivered. The local hardware assembler and components supplier offers 12 months’ warranty. The main hardware components offshore supplier offers a warranty plan of 15 months from the date the product is shipped. With an extended 90 days beyond the current warranty, such repair service would be paid by the supplier except for component replacement costs, which would be paid by DSG.
 
Another important activity related to the management of the product supply chain is working closely with the suppliers and ensuring that we have alternate sources for the main components and identify well in advance any components that may go “end-of-life” and find suitable replacements before product shortages may occur.
 
Inventory Control
 
The Company has implemented strict inventory management procedures that govern the inbound flow of products from suppliers, the outgoing flow to customers as well as the internal movement of inventory between warehouses (Canada, US and UK). There are also procedures in place to control the flow of equipment returning from customers for repairs and their replacements.
Installation
 
The Company is utilizing a small number of its own field engineers, geographically positioned to be in close proximity of areas with high concentrations of current and future customers. Occasionally, when new installations exceed the internal capacity, the company employs a number of external contractors, on a project by project basis. Each contractor has been trained extensively to perform product installations and the Company has created an extensive collection of Installation Manuals for all products and vehicle types.
 
The product was designed with ease of installation as one of its features. Additionally, the installation process includes a pre-shipping configuration process that prepares each device with all the settings and graphics content (if applicable) required for the specific location it will be deployed. This makes the installation process a lot simpler and less time consuming in the field which reduces costs (accommodations, food, travel) for internal staff as well as external contractor cost (less billable time).
 
Another benefit of the simplified installation procedure is increased scalability in anticipation of increased number of installs in the future by reducing the skill level and training time requirements for additional contractors.

Customer Service
 
The Company has deployed its Customer Service staff strategically, so it has at least one service representative active during business hours in North America, Europe and South Africa.
 
The Company is handling Customer Service directly in North America and UK, offering telephone and on-line support to end-customers. In other international markets, the first-line customer service is handled by local distributor’s staff while DSG is supplying training and more advanced support to the distributors.
 
For the management of the customer service activities, the Company is utilizing SalesForce.com CRM system which allows creating, updating, closing and escalation of service cases, including the issuance of RMA (Return Material Authorization) numbers for defective equipment. Using SalesForce.com also allows generation of management reports for service issues, customer satisfaction, and equipment failures in order to quickly identify trends, problem accounts or systemic issues.
 
In addition, DSG began offering the DSG Par 72 Service & Support Plan to guarantee service and support to client courses in the golf business, during fiscal 2016. This program for client courses which guarantees service and support programs within 24 hours of a problem arising.
 
Product Development and Engineering
 
The Company employs a team of software engineers in house to develop and maintain the main components of the server software and firmware.
 
All product development is derived from business needs assessment and customer requests.
 
The Product Manager is reviewing periodically the list of feature requests with the Sales, establishes priorities and updates the Product Roadmap.
 
The software engineers are also responsible for developing specialized tools and systems utilized increase efficiency in the operation of the Company. These projects include functionality such as: automated system monitoring, automatic service alerts, improved remote troubleshooting tools, cellular data monitoring and reporting. All these tools are critical in future ability to support more customers with less resources, streamline support, and improve internal efficiency.
 
All hardware development (electronics and mechanical) is generally outsourced, however small projects like mounting solutions or cabling are handled in house.
