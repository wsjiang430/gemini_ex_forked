ITEM 1.                BUSINESS
General
 
Our business originated in 1972 when Oscar and Evelyn Overton founded a small bakery in the Los Angeles area. In 1978, their son, David Overton, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, led the creation and opening of the first The Cheesecake Factory restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. In 1992, the Company was incorporated in Delaware as The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (referred to herein as the Company or as we, us and our) to consolidate the restaurant and bakery businesses of its predecessors operating under The Cheesecake Factory® mark. Our executive offices are located at 26901 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas Hills, California 91301, and our telephone number is (818) 871-3000.

As of March 4, 2019, we operated 218 Company-owned restaurants: 201 under The Cheesecake Factory® mark, 14 under the Grand Lux Cafe® mark, two under the RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen® mark and one under the Social Monk Asian KitchenTM mark. In addition, 21 The Cheesecake Factory branded restaurants in the Middle East, Mexico, the Chinese Mainland and Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong were operated by third parties under licensing agreements. We also operated two bakery production facilities that produce desserts for our restaurants, international licensees and third-party bakery customers. We are selectively pursuing other means to leverage our competitive strengths, including investing in or acquiring new restaurant concepts (such as North Italia® and Flower Child®), expanding The Cheesecake Factory® brand to other retail opportunities through The Cheesecake Factory At Home® consumer packaged goods and evaluating the future potential of Social Monk Asian Kitchen, our new fast casual concept.
 
In contrast to many restaurant chains, substantially all of our menu items, except those desserts produced at our bakery facilities, are prepared from scratch at our restaurants with high-quality, fresh ingredients using innovative and proprietary recipes. One of our competitive strengths is our ability to anticipate customer preferences and adapt our expansive menu to the latest trends. We regularly update our ingredients and cooking methods, as well as create new menu items, to improve the variety, quality and consistency of our food and keep our menu relevant to customers. All new menu items are selected based on anticipated sales popularity and profitability.
 
We place significant emphasis on the contemporary interior design and decor of our restaurants, which create a high-energy ambiance in a casual setting and contribute to the distinctive dining experience enjoyed by our customers. Our restaurants feature large, open dining areas, and where feasible, both exterior and interior patios. These features require a higher investment per square foot than is typical for the casual dining industry. However, our restaurants have historically generated annual sales per square foot that are also typically higher than our competitors. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.
 
We maintain a general website at www.thecheesecakefactory.com, as well as websites for our bakery and other subsidiaries. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports and our proxy statements are available on our general website at no charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our filings are also available on the SECs website at www.sec.gov. The content of our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
 
We utilize a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Tuesday closest to December 31 for financial reporting purposes. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2016 consisted of 53 weeks. Fiscal year 2019 will consist of 52 weeks. All discussion throughout this report, unless otherwise noted, relates to Company-owned The Cheesecake Factory restaurants.
 
The Cheesecake Factory
 
The Cheesecake Factory restaurants strive to provide a distinctive, high-quality dining experience at moderate prices by offering an extensive, innovative and evolving menu in an upscale casual, high-energy setting with attentive, efficient and friendly service. As a result, The Cheesecake Factory restaurants appeal to a diverse customer base across a broad demographic range. Our extensive menu and strategic selection of locations enable us to compete for substantially all dining preferences and occasions, from the key lunch and dinner day parts to the mid-afternoon and late-night day parts, which are traditionally weaker times for most casual dining restaurants, as well as special occasion dining. The Cheesecake Factory restaurants are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner, and we offer additional menu items for weekend brunch. Most of our locations are closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas. All items on our menu, except alcoholic beverages, are available for off-premise consumption, which represented approximately 14% of our restaurant sales for fiscal year 2018. We work with a third party to provide delivery service, which is now available at nearly all of our restaurants. In addition, we offer online ordering for to-go sales at all of our domestic locations. All of our restaurants offer a full-service bar where our entire menu is served. Our alcoholic beverage sales represented approximately 12% of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant sales for fiscal year 2018.
 
The Cheesecake Factory menu features approximately 250 items, including items presented on supplemental menus, such as our SkinnyLicious® menu that offers innovative items at 590 calories or less. Our core menu offerings include appetizers, pizza, seafood, steaks, chicken, burgers, small plates, pastas, salads, sandwiches and omelettes, including Super food choices and a selection of gluten-free items. Examples of menu offerings include Chicken Madeira, Cajun Jambalaya Pasta, Thai Lettuce Wraps, Avocado Eggrolls, California Guacamole Salad and our Bacon-Bacon Cheeseburger.

Our ability to create, promote and attractively display our unique line of desserts is also important to the competitive positioning and financial success of our restaurants. We offer approximately 50 varieties of proprietary cheesecake and other desserts in our restaurants. Our brand identity and reputation for offering premium desserts results in a significant level of dessert sales, representing approximately 16% of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant sales for fiscal year 2018.
 
Competitive Positioning
 
The restaurant industry is comprised of multiple segments, including fine dining, casual dining, fast casual and quick-service. Our restaurants operate in the upscale casual dining segment, which is differentiated by freshly prepared and innovative food, flavorful recipes with creative presentations, unique restaurant layouts, eye-catching design elements and more personalized service. Upscale casual dining is positioned above core casual dining, with standards that are closer to fine dining. We believe that we are a leader in upscale casual dining given the historically high average sales per square foot of our restaurants as compared to others in this segment.
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive with respect to menu and food quality, service, access to qualified operations personnel, location, decor and value. We compete directly and indirectly for customer traffic with national and regional casual dining restaurant chains, as well as independently-owned restaurants. In addition, we face competition for customer traffic from fast casual and quick-service restaurants, home delivery services, mobile food service, grocery stores and meal kits that are increasing the quality and variety of their food products in response to customer demand. This increased competition, coupled with an oversupply of restaurants, has driven casual dining industry comparable traffic declines in recent years. This backdrop has made it even more challenging to improve customer traffic. We also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for quality sites and qualified staff and managers to operate our restaurants. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our inability to grow comparable restaurant sales could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
The key elements that drive our total customer experience and help position us from a competitive standpoint include the following:
 
Extensive and Innovative Menu. Our restaurants offer one of the broadest menus in casual dining and feature a wide array of flavors with portions designed for sharing. Substantially all of our menu items, except desserts produced at our bakery facilities, are prepared daily at each restaurant using high-quality, fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes. We continue to innovate new menu items and new categories of food offerings at our restaurants, such as our SkinnyLicious® menu, Super food selections and gluten-free choices, further enhancing the variety and price points offered to our customers. We regularly introduce new and innovative cheesecakes and other baked desserts. In 2018, we launched two new cheesecakes, Very Cherry Ghiradelli® Chocolate and Cinnabon® Cinnamon Swirl, in conjunction with National Cheesecake Day.
 
We generally update our menus twice each year to respond to evolving customer dining preferences and food trends, as well as to update pricing. Our philosophy is to use price increases to help offset key operating cost increases in a manner that balances protecting both our margins and customer traffic levels. We plan to target menu price increases of approximately 2% to 3% annually going forward, utilizing a market-based strategy to help mitigate cost pressure in higher-wage geographies, and expect near-term increases to be at the higher end of this range.
Value Proposition. We believe our restaurants are recognized by customers for offering value with a large variety of freshly prepared menu items across a broad array of price points and generous portions at moderate prices. The average check for each customer, including beverages and desserts, was approximately $22.60, $21.85 and $21.40 for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Commitment to Excellent Service and Hospitality through the Selection, Training and Retention of High-quality Staff Members. Our mission is to create an environment where absolute guest satisfaction is our highest priority. We strive to consistently exceed the expectations of our customers in all aspects of their experiences in our restaurants. One of the most important aspects of delivering a consistent and dependable level of service is having a team of experienced managers who can successfully operate our high-volume, complex restaurants. Our recruitment, selection, training, retention and internal promotion programs are among the most comprehensive in the restaurant industry, helping us to attract and retain qualified staff members who are motivated to consistently provide excellence in restauranteuring and customer hospitality. By providing extensive training, our goal is to encourage our staff members to develop a sense of personal commitment to our core values and culture of excellence. (See Restaurant Operations, Management and Staffing below.) Our commitment to people-focused programs and creating a great workplace for all of our staff and managers contributed to The Cheesecake Factory being named in February 2019, for the sixth year in a row, to Fortune magazines list of 100 Best Companies to Work For®.

High-quality, High-Profile Restaurant Locations and Flexible Site Layouts. We target restaurant sites in high-quality, high-profile locations with a balanced mix of retail shopping, entertainment, residences, tourism and businesses. We have the flexibility to design our restaurants to accommodate a wide array of urban and suburban site layouts, including multi-level locations. Our restaurants feature large, open dining areas, high ceilings where available and a contemporary kitchen design. The layouts are flexible, permitting tables and seats to be easily rearranged to accommodate small and large parties, thus permitting more effective utilization of seating capacity. Interior and exterior patio seating, either or both of which are available at approximately 95% of our restaurants, allow for additional customer capacity at a comparatively low occupancy cost per seat. Exterior patio seating is generally available as weather permits. (See New Restaurant Site Selection and Development below.)
Distinctive Restaurant Design and Decor. Our restaurants distinctive contemporary design and decor create a high-energy, upscale ambiance in a casual setting. We have evolved our restaurants design over time to remain current while retaining a similar look and feel to our earlier restaurants. We apply high standards to the maintenance of our restaurants to keep them in like new condition.
 
Integration of our Bakery Operations. The primary role of our bakery operations is to produce innovative, high-quality cheesecakes and other baked desserts for sale at our restaurants and those of our international licensees, which is important to our competitive positioning. Integration of this vital part of our brand gives us control over the creativity and quality of our desserts and is also more profitable than buying from a third party.
 
New Restaurant Site Selection and Development
 
The Cheesecake Factory concept has demonstrated success in a variety of layouts (e.g., single or multi-level and varying interior square feet), site locations (e.g., urban or suburban shopping malls, lifestyle centers, retail strip centers, office complexes, entertainment centers and urban street locations  either freestanding or in-line) and trade areas. Accordingly, we intend to continue developing The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in high-quality, high-profile locations that meet our rigorous site standards. We regularly negotiate leases for potential future locations and plan to open as many locations in any given year as there are sites available that meet our site selection criteria. It is difficult for us to precisely predict the timing of our new restaurant openings due to many factors that are outside of our control. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our inability to secure an adequate number of high-quality sites for future restaurant openings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.) We have the flexibility in our restaurant designs to penetrate a wide variety of markets across varying population densities in both existing and new markets. We continue to target approximately 300 Company-owned and operated restaurants domestically over time, as well as the potential for an additional eight to ten locations in Canada depending upon our ability to ultimately achieve the targeted profitability of our initial location.
 
The locations of our restaurants are critical to our long-term success, and we devote significant time and resources to analyzing each prospective site. We consider many factors when assessing the suitability of a site, including the demographics of the trade area such as average household income, and historical and anticipated population growth. Since our restaurants can be successfully executed within a variety of site locations and layouts, we are highly flexible in choosing suitable locations. While there are common decor elements within each of our restaurant sites, the designs are customized for the specifics of each location, including the building type, square footage and layout of available space. Our existing restaurants range from 5,000 to 21,000 interior square feet, and we expect the majority of our new restaurants to vary between 7,500 and 10,000 interior square feet, generally with additional exterior and/or interior patio seating, selected appropriately for each market and specific site.
 
The relatively high sales productivity of our restaurants provides opportunities to obtain competitive leasing terms from landlords. Due to the flexible and customized nature of our restaurant operations and the complex design, construction and preopening processes for each new location, our lease negotiation and restaurant development time frames vary. The development and opening process usually ranges from six to eighteen months, depending largely on the availability of the leased space we intend to occupy, and can be subject to delays either due to factors outside of our control or to our selective timing of restaurant openings.
 
Unit Economics
 
The operation of high-quality restaurants in premier locations fitting our criteria contributes to the continuing customer appeal of The Cheesecake Factory. This popularity is reflected in our average sales per restaurant and per square foot, which are among the highest of any publicly-held restaurant company.
 
Average sales per location for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants open for the full year on a 52-week basis were approximately $10.7 million, $10.6 million and $10.7 million for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Since each of our restaurants has a customized layout and differs in size, an effective method to measure the unit economics of our sites is by square foot. Average sales per productive square foot (defined as all interior square footage plus seasonally adjusted exterior patio square footage) for restaurants open for the full year on a 52-week basis were approximately $978, $962 and $971 for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fluctuations in both average sales per location and average sales per productive square foot generally track with comparable restaurant sales trends. (See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on comparable restaurant sales.)

We currently lease all of our restaurant locations and utilize capital for leasehold improvements and furnishings, fixtures and equipment (FF&E) to build out our restaurant premises. Total costs are targeted at approximately $900 to $1,000 per interior square foot for The Cheesecake Factory restaurants. The construction costs to build our restaurant premises vary depending on a number of factors, including geography, the complexity of our build-out, site characteristics, governmental fees and permits, labor and material conditions in the local market, weather and the amount, if any, of construction contributions obtained from our landlords for structural additions and other leasehold improvements. These costs have trended higher over the past several years due primarily to wage inflation and the availability of trade labor in certain geographies.
 
In selecting sites for our restaurants, an important objective is to earn an appropriate return on investment. We measure returns using a cash-on-cash return on investment calculated by dividing restaurant-level EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and preopening costs) by our cash investment. With restaurant-level EBITDA targeted at 18% on average after entering our comparable sales base, our goal is to achieve an average cash-on-cash return of approximately 20% to 25% for new restaurants. Investing in new restaurant development that meets our return on investment criteria supports achieving a Company-level return on invested capital (ROIC) of approximately 15%. There are no guarantees that targeted returns will be achieved.
 
Our new restaurants typically open with initial sales volumes well in excess of their future run-rate levels. This initial honeymoon effect usually results from grand opening publicity and other customer awareness activities that generate higher than usual customer traffic, particularly in new markets. During the three to six months following the opening of new restaurants, customer traffic generally settles into its normal pattern, resulting in sales volumes that gradually adjust downward to their post-opening run-rate level. Additionally, our new restaurants usually require a period of time after reaching normal traffic levels to achieve their targeted restaurant-level operating margins due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with new, highly complex casual dining restaurants such as ours.
 
Restaurant Operations, Management and Staffing
 
Our ability to consistently execute a complex menu offering items prepared daily with high-quality, fresh ingredients in an upscale casual, high-volume dining environment is critical to our overall success. We employ detailed operating procedures, standards, controls, food line management systems and cooking methods and processes to accommodate our extensive menu and to drive sales productivity. However, the successful day-to-day operation of our restaurants remains critically dependent on the ability, dedication and engagement of our General Managers (GMs), Executive Kitchen Managers (EKMs) and all other management and hourly staff members working at our restaurants. Competition among restaurant companies for qualified management and staff remains very high. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified restaurant management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
We believe that the high average sales volumes and popularity of our restaurants allow us to attract and retain high-quality, experienced restaurant-level management and other operational personnel. Each restaurant is generally staffed with one GM, one EKM and an average of six to ten additional kitchen and front-of-the-house managers, depending on the size and sales volume of each restaurant. Our GMs and EKMs possess an average of more than ten years of experience with the Company. This tenure and knowledge drives our high productivity and contributes to our ability to deliver an exceptional customer experience. All newly-recruited restaurant managers complete an extensive training program during which they receive both classroom and on-the-job instruction in areas such as food quality and safety, customer service, financial management, staff relations and safely serving alcohol. Managers continue their development by participating in and completing a variety of training and development activities to assess and further develop their skills and knowledge necessary for upward progression through our management levels. Our GMs regularly meet to receive hands-on training, share best practices and celebrate Company successes, all of which help to foster the unique culture of our brand.
 
Each restaurant GM reports to an Area Director of Operations (ADO) who supervises the operations of seven to nine restaurants within a geographic area. In turn, each ADO reports to one of four Regional Vice Presidents of Restaurant Operations. Our EKMs report to their GMs, but are also supervised by an Area Kitchen Operations Manager responsible for between eight and ten restaurants. Our restaurant field supervision organization also includes our Senior Vice President of Operations, Chief Culinary Officer, an operations services team and our performance development department who are collectively responsible for day-to-day operations, managing new restaurant openings and training for all operational managers and staff.

To enable us to more effectively compete for, and retain, the highest quality restaurant management personnel, we offer an innovative and comprehensive compensation program for our restaurant GMs and EKMs. Each participant receives a competitive base salary and has the opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on quantitative restaurant performance metrics. GMs are also eligible to use a Company-leased vehicle. In addition, we provide a longer-term, equity incentive program to our GMs and EKMs based on their extended service with us in their respective positions and their achievement of certain performance objectives. We believe that these awards encourage our GMs and EKMs to think and act as business owners, assist in retention of restaurant management and align our managers interests with those of our stockholders.
 
Our restaurant GMs are responsible for selecting and training hourly staff members for their respective restaurants. Each restaurant is staffed, on average, with approximately 170 hourly staff members. We require each hourly staff member to participate in a formal training program for his or her respective position in the restaurant, under the supervision of other experienced staff members and restaurant management. We strive to foster enthusiasm and commitment in our staff members, and respect for one another, through daily staff meetings and dedicated time for training. We solicit suggestions concerning restaurant operations and other aspects of our business through an annual engagement survey, GM and workgroup meetings, a website dedicated to receiving staff member input and other means, fostering a highly-engaged workforce.
 
Our commitment to people-focused programs and creating a great workplace for all of our staff and managers contributed to The Cheesecake Factory being named in February 2019, for the sixth year in a row, to Fortune magazines list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For®, which is published annually based on a culture review and surveys of current staff members to identify and recognize companies that create positive work environments with high employee morale and fulfillment. In 2018, we were also named to the Fortune 100 Best Workplaces for Women®, 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity®, and 100 Best Workplaces for Millennials®. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Transforming Data into Knowledge (TDn2K)/People Report awarded us the Global Best Practices Award in January 2018, recognizing best overall performance based on restaurant management retention, hourly employee retention, composite diversity, year-over-year improvement and community involvement.
 
Preopening Costs for New Restaurants
 
Due to the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale, high-volume concept and the investment we make in properly training our staff to operate our restaurants, our preopening process is more extensive, time consuming and costly than that of many restaurant chains. Preopening costs for a typical restaurant in an established market average approximately $1.7 million to $2.0 million and include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management staff members during the preopening period, costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant staff members, and wages, travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support staff members. Also included are planned management growth expenses for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings, the associated temporary housing and other costs necessary to relocate managers in alignment with future restaurant opening and operating needs, and corporate travel and support activities.
 
Preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant. Preopening costs vary by location depending on a number of factors, including the proximity of our existing restaurants, the size and physical layout of each location, the number of management and hourly staff members required to operate each restaurant, the availability of qualified restaurant staff members, the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas, the timing of the restaurant opening and the extent of unexpected delays, if any, in obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurant, which may also depend on our landlords obtaining their licenses and permits and completing their construction activities. Preopening costs are generally higher for larger restaurants and initial entry into new markets and lower when we relocate a restaurant within its local market. We usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs within the two months immediately preceding and the month of a restaurants opening. Preopening costs per restaurant will also depend on our ability to leverage planned management growth expenses.

Expansion of Licensed Locations
 
We currently have licensing agreements with three restaurant operators to develop and operate The Cheesecake Factory® brand restaurants in selected international markets. Our licensees invest their capital to build and operate the restaurants, and we receive initial development fees, site and design fees and ongoing royalties based on our licensees restaurant sales. In addition, these licensees purchase bakery products branded under The Cheesecake Factory® mark from us. We project each international licensed location to contribute approximately $0.01 in annual earnings per share (EPS), on average, once the location has been in operation for a full year. As of March 4, 2019, our international licensees operated the following The Cheesecake Factory restaurants:

Licensee Location | Restaurant Location | # of Restaurants
-------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------
Kuwait (1) | Bahrain | 1 
 | Kingdom of Saudi Arabia | 2 
 | Kuwait | 3 
 | Lebanon | 1 
 | Qatar | 3 
 | United Arab Emirates | 5 
Mexico (2) | Mexico | 3 
Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong (3) | Chinese Mainland | 2 
 | Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong | 1 
Total | | 21 

 
(1)         This licensee, or its affiliates, also has the right to develop restaurants in Egypt, with the opportunity to expand the agreement to include Algeria, Hungary, Iraq, Libya, Morocco, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, The Czech Republic, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine.
 (2)         This licensee, or its affiliates, also has the right to develop restaurants in Chile, with the opportunity to expand the agreement to include Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Peru.
 (3)         This licensee, or its affiliates, also has the right to develop restaurants in Macao and Taiwan, with the opportunity to expand the agreement to include Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
 
Our corporate infrastructure includes a dedicated global development team that works with our international licensees and coordinates the initial training, ongoing quality control, product specifications and brand oversight at our licensed locations. Our internal audit department also performs periodic reviews of our international licensees compliance with our licensing agreements.
 
As we evaluate other international markets, we will consider opportunities to directly operate certain locations and/or enter into licensing, joint venture or partnership arrangements with established third-party companies. We are selective in our assessment of potential partners and licensees, focusing on well-capitalized companies that have established business infrastructures, expertise in multiple countries, experience in operating upscale casual dining restaurants and sound governance practices. We look to associate with companies who will protect The Cheesecake Factory® brand and operate the concept in a high-quality, consistent manner.
 
Due to the complexities of opening The Cheesecake Factory restaurants in other countries, including, but not limited to, the selection and design of appropriate sites, construction of our complex restaurant designs, training of licensees staff members, approval of supply sources and exportation of our bakery products to new countries, the number and timing of new openings in foreign countries may vary from expectations. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  We face a variety of risks and challenges related to our international operations and global brand development efforts that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Bakery Operations
 
We own and operate two bakery production facilities, one in Calabasas Hills, California, and one in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Our facility in California accommodates both production operations and corporate support personnel, while our facility in North Carolina houses production operations and a distribution center. In fiscal 2018, we completed an infrastructure modernization of our California facility.
 
We produce approximately 70 varieties of proprietary cheesecakes and other baked desserts using high-quality ingredients for The Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux Cafe restaurants, and for international licensees and third-party customers. Some of our most popular cheesecakes include the Original Cheesecake, Ultimate Red Velvet Cake CheesecakeTM, Godiva® Chocolate Cheesecake, Oreo® Dream Extreme Cheesecake and Salted Caramel. Other popular baked desserts include Chocolate Tower Truffle CakeTM, Carrot Cake, Black-Out Cake and Lemoncello Cream Torte.
 
The primary role of our bakery operations is to produce innovative, high-quality cheesecakes and other baked desserts for sale at our restaurants and those of our international licensees. Integration of this vital part of our brand gives us control over the creativity and quality of our desserts and is also more profitable than buying from a third party.

We also leverage The Cheesecake Factory brand identity and utilize our bakery production capacity by selling cheesecakes and other baked products to external foodservice operators, retailers and distributors. Current large-account customers include leading national warehouse club operators, foodservice distributors, supermarkets and other restaurants, a national retail bookstore cafe and foodservice operators. We also currently sell a selection of our cakes online and in catalogs domestically through an agreement with an upscale retailer. Items produced for outside accounts are marketed under The Cheesecake Factory Bakery® and The Cheesecake Factory At Home® marks and other private labels and were previously marketed under The Cheesecake Factory® and The Dream Factory® marks.
 
We also sell baked goods internationally under The Cheesecake Factory Bakery®, The Cheesecake Factory At Home®, The Cheesecake Factory® and The Dream Factory® marks and have entered over 30 countries with our brands. Offering our cheesecakes and other baked desserts internationally is important to our branding, creating awareness and driving demand, not only for bakery products but for the international expansion of our restaurants.
Incremental Growth Opportunities
 
We are pursuing a number of incremental growth opportunities that would complement the continued domestic and international expansion of The Cheesecake Factory concept.
 
Investments in North Italia and Flower Child
 
During fiscal 2016, we entered into a strategic relationship with Fox Restaurant Concepts LLC (FRC) with respect to two of its brands, North Italia and Flower Child, that share a number of parallels with us in terms of culture and philosophy:
 
·            North Italia is a modern interpretation of Italian cooking in the upscale casual dining segment. All dishes are handmade from scratch daily. We see a number of synergistic attributes, including operations and real estate development, as well as significant market opportunity for an on-trend Italian offering.
 ·            Flower Child is a fast casual concept offering a customizable menu, made fresh from scratch, featuring locally-sourced, all-natural and organic ingredients in salads, plates, bowls and wraps. This is a potential opportunity for us to diversify our portfolio in a strong and growing niche.
 
FRC, or its affiliates, continues to own the intellectual property, manage day-to-day operations and provide infrastructure support to facilitate the near-term growth of both of these concepts.
 
We made initial minority equity investments in these concepts during fiscal 2016 and invested additional growth capital during fiscal 2018 and 2017. We plan to make additional growth capital contributions to North Italia and Flower Child in fiscal 2019.We have the right, and an obligation if certain financial, legal and operational conditions are met, to acquire the remaining interest in North Italia in fiscal 2019 and Flower Child in fiscal 2021. Based on North Italias current performance, we are likely to acquire the remaining interest in the concept at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and are evaluating financing alternatives. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our strategic relationship with FRC might not yield the anticipated benefits, and we may lose some or all of our investment, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Consumer Packaged Goods
 
Given the strong affinity for The Cheesecake Factory® brand, in 2017 we began leveraging opportunities in the consumer packaged goods channel. We now partner with third-party manufacturers to offer a variety of products marketed under The Cheesecake Factory At Home® mark in retail stores. These offerings include our Famous Brown Bread, coffee creamer, baking mixes, confections and refrigerated puddings. We are actively evaluating other synergistic, on-brand licensing opportunities to add incremental revenue streams to our business.
Internal Development of Social Monk Asian Kitchen, a Fast Casual Concept
 
In February 2019, we opened the first location of our internally developed fast casual concept, Social Monk Asian Kitchen. Social Monk Asian Kitchen is a fast casual Asian concept with a modern urban feel. The menu features the cuisines of Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Indonesia and India in made-to-order starters, salads, soups, sandwiches, rice and noodle bowls, classic entrees, vegetables and sides and house-made frozen custard. The restaurant also offers beer and wine. Examples of menu offerings include Crisp Vegetable Spring Rolls, Thai Beef Noodle Salad, Bahn Mi, Crispy Princess Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles. This initial site will allow us to test the concept and evaluate its future potential. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  We are selectively pursuing and continue to evaluate developing, investing in or acquiring new restaurant concepts, expansion of The Cheesecake Factory At Home® brand to other retail opportunities and other initiatives which may create risks to our business that could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)

Other Concepts
 
In addition to The Cheesecake Factory, we also operate Grand Lux Cafe and RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen. At present, we have no plans to open additional locations.
Grand Lux Cafe
 
Grand Lux Cafe is an upscale casual dining concept that offers globally-inspired cuisine with an ambiance of modern sophistication. Using fresh ingredients, the menu of approximately 175 items at Grand Lux Cafe offers classic American dishes and international favorites, including appetizers, pasta, seafood, steaks, chicken, burgers, salads, specialty items and desserts. Examples of menu offerings include our Cedar Planked B.B.Q Salmon, Buffalo Chicken Rolls and Shrimp Scampi. Each Grand Lux Cafe features an on-site bakery which produces a selection of signature desserts, and a full-service bar.
RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen
 
RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen features a Southeast Asian menu and design elements in an upscale casual dining setting.

Purchasing and Distribution
 
We strive to obtain quality menu ingredients, bakery raw materials and other supplies and services for our operations from reliable sources at competitive prices and consistent with our sustainability goals. We continually research and evaluate various ingredients and products in an effort to maintain high quality, be responsive to changing consumer tastes and manage costs.
 
In order to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to provide the freshest ingredients for our menu items while obtaining competitive prices for the required quality and consistency, each restaurants management determines the quantities of food and supplies required for their restaurant and orders the items from local, regional and national suppliers based upon specifications established by our corporate office and on terms negotiated by our central purchasing staff. We strive to maintain restaurant-level inventories at a minimum dollar level in relation to sales due to the high concentration and relatively rapid turnover of the perishable produce, poultry, meat, fish and dairy commodities that we use in our operations, coupled with the limited storage space at our restaurants. Independent foodservice distributors, including the largest foodservice distributor in North America, deliver most items multiple times per week to our restaurants.
 
We purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations, based on market prices established with our suppliers. Many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control.  We seek to mitigate the risk of supply shortages and obtain competitive prices by utilizing multiple qualified suppliers for substantially all of our ingredients and supplies.
 
We negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for some of our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, such as certain dairy products and poultry, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We continue to evaluate the possibility of entering into similar arrangements for other commodities and also periodically evaluate hedging vehicles, such as direct financial instruments, to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with such commodities. As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had no hedging contracts in place. We may or may not have the ability to increase menu prices, or vary menu items, in response to food commodity price increases. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our inability to anticipate and react effectively to changes in the costs of key operating resources may increase our cost of doing business, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Information Technology
 
Our technology-enabled business solutions are designed to provide effective financial controls, cost management, improved efficiencies and enhanced customer experience. Our business intelligence solution and data warehouse architecture provide corporate and restaurant management with information and insights into key operational metrics and performance indicators. This framework delivers enterprise reporting, dashboards and analytics, and allows access to metrics such as quote and wait time accuracy, staff member retention trends, and restaurant quality and service analyses.

Our restaurant point of sale and back-office systems provide information regarding daily sales, cash receipts, inventory, food and beverage costs, labor costs and other controllable operating expenses. We offer online ordering for to-go sales in all of our The Cheesecake Factory restaurants, and our point of sale system is integrated with our delivery provider to drive efficiencies in the restaurants and enhance the customer delivery experience. We offer a mobile payment application, CakePay®, which provides convenience to our customers, enabling them to complete the payment process at any time during their dining experience using their mobile device. We utilize a customer satisfaction measurement platform that leverages the Net Promoter Score methodology at all of our restaurants. The data and analytics provided by this software provide us with actionable insights to better understand what customer experience opportunities should be addressed, while reinforcing positive staff behaviors.
 
Our kitchen management system provides automated routing and cook line balancing, and synchronizes order completion, ticket time and cook time data, promoting more efficient levels of labor and productivity without sacrificing quality. We leverage our recipe viewer system to ensure timely and accurate recipe updates, and to provide instructional media content and detailed procedures enabling our staff to consistently prepare our highly-complex, diverse menu across all locations. We utilize a web-based labor scheduling solution to enhance scheduling precision and staff satisfaction. We also employ a web-based notification and tracking solution to contact our restaurants and monitor progress in the event of a needed product withdrawal or recall.
 
Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our concepts is provided by both our internal support services team at our corporate center as well as third-party vendors for remote and on-site restaurant support. Each restaurant has a private high-speed wide area connection to send and receive critical business data as well as to access web-based applications securely. We implemented a failover capability whereby a secondary public circuit is used to automatically establish a secure connection to our private network if the primary connection becomes unavailable. We employ modern restaurant switching and routing technology that allows us to leverage and support contemporary security standards and practices and employ wireless capability for a variety of mobile uses. All of our core and critical applications are housed in an external tier 3 data center. To mitigate business interruptions, we utilize a disk-based data backup and replication infrastructure between our onsite and external data centers so all data is replicated nightly between the two sites.
 
We employ a multi-discipline security incident response plan to recognize, manage and resolve cybersecurity threats, and require cybersecurity awareness training for all staff members who have access to our cyber systems. We also maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to further reduce our risk profile. Security of our financial data and other sensitive information remains a high priority for us, led by our information technology department in conjunction with an interdepartmental information security council representing all of our key functional areas. We utilize a private key infrastructure ensuring only trusted devices can access our network and require secure sockets layer (SSL) certificates for access to sites outside of our network. Also, in an effort to further secure our customers credit card information, we employ a robust encryption and tokenization platform for all credit card transactions in our restaurants, ensuring that no credit card data is stored in our internal systems. This includes equipment that can also process smart payment cards, commonly referred to as EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa). (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Information technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and subject us to increased operating costs, as well as to litigation and other liabilities, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Marketing and Advertising
 
We rely on our reputation, as well as our high-profile locations, media exposure and positive word of mouth, to maintain and grow market share rather than focusing on traditional paid advertising through television, radio or print, or using significant discounting. We utilize a social media and digital marketing strategy that allows us to engage regularly with our customers outside of our restaurants, including communication on Facebook®, Twitter®, Pinterest®, Instagram® and other social media platforms, Google search advertising and direct email to customers. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Any inability to effectively use and manage social media could harm our marketing efforts as well as our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Public relations is another important aspect of our marketing approach, and we frequently appear on local and national television in connection with a variety of promotional opportunities, such as National Cheesecake Day, to perform cooking demonstrations and other brand-building exposure. We generated approximately four billion media impressions in fiscal 2018 at minimal cost to us. We partner with several premiere third-party gift card distributors, contributing to our brand awareness and gift card sales. We also attempt to build awareness and relationships with retailers located in the same developments, shopping center operators, local hotel concierges, neighborhood groups and others in the community. For restaurants opening in new markets, we strive to obtain local television, radio station and newspaper coverage in order to benefit from publicity at low or no cost. At times, we also engage in marketing and advertising opportunities in selective local markets. In addition, we partner with our third-party delivery provider and consumer packaged goods licensees on co-branded marketing campaigns.
 
10




Our international licensees are committed to opening each new restaurant with marketing that can be comprised of a mix of elements including print, billboards, digital and radio. We maintain final approval of our licensees marketing campaigns and social media posts to promote consistency in the look and feel of marketing efforts including our brand, domestically and abroad.
 
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
 
While seasonal fluctuations generally do not have a material impact on our quarterly results, year-over-year comparison of our quarterly results can be significantly impacted by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and associated preopening costs, the calendar days of the week on which holidays occur, the impact from inclement weather and other climatic conditions, the additional week in a 53-week fiscal year and other variations in revenues and expenses. Because of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.
Food Safety and Quality Assurance
 
Our food safety processes and systems are designed to mitigate the risk of contamination and illness and to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements as well as industry standards. We continuously seek to improve our food safety and sanitation policies and procedures. Our work and management processes are verified by routine internal and third-party health inspection audits and regulatory agency inspections. In addition, our bakery facilities are Safe Quality Food (SQF) certified in alignment with the Global Food Safety Initiatives Global Markets Program.
 
In selecting suppliers, we look for key performance indicators relating to sanitation, operations and facility management, good manufacturing and agricultural practices, product protection, recovery and food security. In addition to measuring and testing food safety and security practices, we strive to ensure that all our food suppliers have annual food safety and quality system audits. Our restaurants and bakery facilities also follow regulatory guidelines required for conducting and managing ingredient and product traceability. We utilize a web-based notification and tracking solution to efficiently contact our restaurants and monitor our progress in the event of a product withdrawal or recall. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Concerns relating to food safety, food-borne illness, pandemics and other diseases could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of government authorities, which may include alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, environmental, labor, immigration, zoning and public safety agencies. We are also subject to various environmental regulations, including water usage, sanitation disposal and transportation mitigation.
 
Our international business exposes us to additional regulations, including antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott legislation, import/export and customs regulations and other international trade regulations, privacy laws, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
 
As a provider of food products, we are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States (U.S), including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, the Federal Food Safety Modernization Act and regulations concerning nutritional labeling under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our inability to respond appropriately to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations, and to adapt to evolving consumer dining preferences could negatively impact our operations and competitive position, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
In order to serve alcoholic beverages in our restaurants, we must comply with alcoholic beverage control regulations which require each of our restaurants to apply to a state or other governmental alcoholic beverage control authority for licenses and permits to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. In addition, we are subject to dram shop statutes in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. To help mitigate this risk, we carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance.

Various federal, state, local and foreign laws govern our operations and our relationships with our staff members, including such matters as minimum wages, breaks, scheduling, exempt classifications, equal pay, overtime, tip credits, fringe benefits, leaves, safety, working conditions, provision of health insurance and citizenship or work authorization requirements. In California, we are subject to the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) which authorizes employees to file lawsuits to recover civil penalties on behalf of themselves, other employees and the State of California for labor code violations. We must also comply with local, state and federal laws protecting the right to equal employment opportunities and prohibiting discrimination and harassment in the work place. We have enhanced our training and awareness programs in these areas and plan to further expand this training curriculum in fiscal 2019. We are also subject to the regulations of the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
 
Our facilities must comply with applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related federal, state and foreign statutes which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to public accommodations and employment. Under the ADA and related state and local laws, we take steps to make our new or significantly remodeled restaurants, our corporate and bakery facilities and our websites readily accessible to disabled persons. We make reasonable accommodations for the employment of disabled persons as required by applicable laws.
 
A significant number of our hourly restaurant staff members receive income from gratuities.  In the United States, we participate voluntarily in a Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). By complying with the educational and other requirements of the TRAC agreement, we reduce the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments for unreported or underreported tips.
 
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information (including social security numbers), financial information (including credit card numbers) and health information.
 
(See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Changes in, or any failure to comply with, applicable laws or regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our restaurants and/or increase our cost to do so, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Trade Names, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 
We own various types of intellectual property and have applied to register trade names, logos, service marks, trademarks and copyrights (collectively, Intellectual Property) in the United States, Canada and in additional countries throughout the world in various categories, including without limitation, restaurant services and bakery goods. We regard our Intellectual Property, including without limitation The Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe, RockSugar Southeast Asian Kitchen, Social Monk Asian Kitchen, The Cheesecake Factory Bakery, and The Cheesecake Factory At Home, as well as our trade dress, as having substantial value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important Intellectual Property whenever commercially feasible and to vigorously oppose infringements of our Intellectual Property. The duration of Intellectual Property registrations varies from country to country, and we have not registered all of our trademarks in every country in which we now or in the future may do business. However, registrations of Intellectual Property are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We have also registered various internet domain names, including, without limitation, www.thecheesecakefactory.com, www.grandluxcafe.com, www.rocksugarkitchen.com, www.socialmonk.com and www.thecheesecakefactorybakery.com, as well as derivations of these and other domain names to include international country codes. (See Item 1A  Risk Factors  Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our financial performance.)
 
Charitable Giving
 
The Cheesecake Factory Oscar and Evelyn Overton Charitable Foundation (Foundation) was created as a means to give back to the communities that our restaurants serve, as well as to unite our staff members in charitable causes. Since the inception of its annual Invitational Charity Golf Tournament, the Foundation has raised $3.4 million, including $0.3 million in fiscal 2018, for the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, a leading research and treatment center for cancer, diabetes and other life-threatening diseases in Southern California.
 
In fiscal 2018, over 3,000 of our staff members volunteered their time to the Foundation to serve holiday meals to low-income individuals and families in 13 Salvation Army centers across the United States at our annual Thanksgiving Day Feast. Additionally, the Foundation provides sponsorships for teams of our staff members who work directly with non-profit organizations in their communities supporting a variety of local and national initiatives.
 
12




In addition to the efforts of the Foundation, the Company directly participates in a variety of charitable endeavors.  Through the nationwide Harvest Food Donation Program, we regularly donate surplus food from our restaurants to local food rescue operations for distribution to soup kitchens and shelters. Since the programs inception in 2007, we have donated more than 4.7 million pounds of food, including approximately 445,000 pounds in fiscal 2018.
 
We also contribute to Feeding America®, the nations largest domestic hunger-relief organization, through specially-designated cheesecake sales, periodic meal donation campaigns in conjunction with our delivery provider and participation in Feeding Americas annual campaign to bring awareness to and help fight domestic hunger by donating peanut butter to local food banks. In fiscal 2018, we donated $0.2 million to Feeding America through sales of our Very Cherry Ghirardelli® cheesecake, bringing our total contributions to $4.6 million over the past eleven years. Nationwide in fiscal 2018, our staff members collected approximately 267,000 pounds of peanut butter for donation to Feeding Americas annual campaign.
 
Additionally, we partner with the California Community Foundation to provide a method for our staff members to assist other staff members in need through our The Cheesecake Factory HELP fund.
 
Sustainability
 
We strive to achieve excellence and quality in everything we do. As a part of this commitment, we continue to develop a sustainability program that is aligned with our culture and values, is operationally feasible given the complexity of our restaurants and is financially responsible. We regularly examine all aspects of our business in an effort to identify, create and implement meaningful and sustained change.

Our staff members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relations with our staff members to be favorable. Our commitment to people-focused programs and creating a great workplace for all of our staff and managers contributed to The Cheesecake Factory being named in February 2019, for the sixth year in a row, to Fortune magazines list of 100 Best Companies to Work For®, among other human resources awards.
