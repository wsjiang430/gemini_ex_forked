Item 1.    Business
Company Overview
We are engaged in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of augmented reality wearable display and computing devices, also referred to as head mounted displays (“HMDs”) in the form of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. Our wearable display devices are worn like eyeglasses or attach to a head worn mount. These devices typically include a built-in computer, cameras, and sensors that enable the user to view, record and interact with video and digital content, such as computer data, the Internet, enterprise data, social media or entertainment applications effectively connecting the metaverse to the real world. Our wearable display products integrate micro-display technology with our advanced optics to produce compact high-resolution display engines, less than half an inch diagonally, which when viewed through our Smart Glasses and AR glasses create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. This includes the representative forms such as augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) and the areas interpolated to all real-and-virtual combined environments. Our solutions are proven to help our customers improve their operational efficiency and allow users of our glasses to operate hands free.
Today’s near-eye or HMD products for AR, MR, XR and Virtual Reality are typically large goggles which are bulky and as a result, they have limited mass-market appeal. We have developed thin optics, called waveguides, that are fully see-through and enable miniature display engines to be mounted in the temples of the HMD which allows the form factor of the Smart Glasses to be near comparable to conventional eyeglasses. Our Smart Glasses and AR glasses are designed for all day use cases and are small enough to fit in a user’s pocket or purse. No external cabling or tethering to an external computing device is required to use our current Smart Glasses unlike most competitors today.
We believe that our waveguide optics and display engines offer a number of significant advantages over other wearable display solutions, including higher contrast, greater power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, and high brightness images for use outdoors. We also believe that our waveguide optics give us a substantial advantage over competitors’ optics, including other waveguides, because our solution allows us to produce optics that are fully transparent when off while also delivering the high brightness required for AR and enterprise Smart Glasses applications.
We believe that our compact display engine technologies coupled with our waveguides are a key differentiator for enabling next generation AR and Smart Glasses hardware for the enterprise and many other market segments because they will ultimately allow us to make HMDs nearly indistinguishable from regular fashion forward eyeglasses. We believe that key growth areas for us currently are the enterprise, medical, defense, and security and then ultimately will expand into broader consumer markets. We are addressing most of these markets by developing and selling our own finished products and building a growing eco-system of software and services internally and with our value-added resellers (VARs), distributors, software developers and end customers. Another potential channel to these markets that we are in the early stages of developing include the sale of components to Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”) where we intend to supply mass production of our waveguide optics and display engines to select third parties to use in their products or provide a white-labeled AR Smart Glasses reference design that select third parties can customize and sell as a branded product.
We have developed our own intellectual property portfolio that includes not only patents, but also over 25 years of manufacturing know-how, software, proprietary processes, materials, and equipment to create high performance waveguides, and near-eye display products. Our in-house waveguide manufacturing processes and equipment has the ability to produce in volume and at broad market price points. 
In 2022, we began investing in our own next generation micro-LED display technology with Atomistic SAS, a new entity based in France with whom we are engaged as a partner. We believe our technology, intellectual property portfolio and established position in the marketplace give us a leadership position in AR and Smart Glasses products, waveguide optics, micro LEDs and display engine technology.

Our History
Historically, we have focused on three markets: the consumer markets for VR, entertainment and mobile video; Smart Glasses products for enterprise; and night-vision display electronics and rugged mobile displays for defense markets. We introduced our first HMD products over 25 years ago and we have offered numerous product models and versions with ever-advancing features and capabilities that have served these three markets. In June 2012, we sold the assets that produced products and provided services to military organizations and defense organizations and exited the defense and security markets by giving that buyer a non-compete period of exclusivity for 10 years. Effective June 2022, all market restrictions in the defense and security space for the Company expired and, as a result, we have resumed marketing and sales initiatives directly into the defense and homeland security markets.
Overall Strategy
Our goal is to establish and maintain a leadership position as a worldwide supplier of wearable displays and computers including AR glasses and Smart Glasses solutions, as well as manufacturing related components needed to build such products, to third party OEMs. We strive to be an innovator in designing wearable display devices that can enable hands-free enterprise productivity applications, see-what-I see remote viewing and AR applications. We seek to generate top and bottom-line revenue growth through the continued introduction of new AR Smart Glasses, waveguides and display engines, and, to a lesser degree, software applications and solutions.

The Market
The mobile phone has evolved into a ubiquitous, location-aware, and powerful smart mobile computing device. Mobile technology has redefined the way people interact with their world, both at work and play, and it has become an essential technology for most individuals around the globe. We believe that interactive AR content, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Edge Computing, internet of things (IoT), and speech-based cloud services will significantly further change the way such mobile computing devices are used and how content is delivered to the user, including the enabling of new experiences that cannot be experienced in any other way. We believe head-worn displays that are hands-free can connect the digital world to the real world and have the ability to change the future of the computing industry.
Current mobile display technology is almost universally based upon direct view screens. These displays are designed to be handheld and small to make portability easy. Our products provide hands-free virtual large screens that are interactive and fit into eyeglass form factors. AR-based displays are designed to be "see-through" or "see-around" and allow the user to still see and interact with their surroundings. They may contain one (monocular) or two (binocular) displays. 
Our business for the last five years has primarily focused on enterprise, industrial and medical markets. We believe the demand for head-worn displays in these markets is being driven by such factors and expectations as:

● | the continued growth of mobile computing devices;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | an increasing number of “ready-to-go” hands-free enterprise, commercial and medical applications for which our products are well-suited;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increasing demand for Internet, and cloud services’ access “anywhere, anytime”;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the expansion of IoT that enables the exchange of information amongst smart connected devices to improve timeliness and visibility;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the need for better efficiencies from training and on-boarding to the ROI created by having hands-free mobile computing allowing frontline workers to work more efficiently and accurately;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the need to solve complex problems remotely ranging from medical technologists and doctors in a surgery to equipment in factories around the world; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the growing use of AR/XR applications that will drive the need for head-worn display solutions to replace the need to hold up handheld devices to use the applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result, we believe that our near-eye display technologies can significantly increase user satisfaction and allow for widespread AR adoption and applications.
Target Markets
We offer smart wearable display and computing products that enable the development and deployment of AR applications. AR Smart Glasses enable the wearer to see computer-generated information, graphics or images projected into the real-world environment or upon an object that the user is observing. 
Our target markets and applications by sector are:
Enterprise
Our Smart Glasses products are currently focused on the enterprise market, including sectors such as industrial and medical. These Smart Glasses products run native Android applications within the glasses that, for example, allow them to stream video in real-time, scan bar codes, share visuals that are related to the work at hand and much more, all of

​



which are highly useful for many enterprise applications. We believe that increasing demand for easy and instant data accessibility in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets offer significant opportunities for our products. The benefit of hands-free mobile displays and computers over a handheld device or laptop on a cart is significant. Most mobile workers need the use of their hands while working and having ready access to the information required while being hands-free can significantly improve their work performance, enhance safety, and reduce errors. Our Smart Glasses are being used for numerous applications including: remote service video support, wearable computer displays, viewing of wireless sensor data, quality assurance, hands-free access to work instructions such as assembly checklists and manuals, in-the-field maintenance, warehouse pick-and-pack, real-time viewing of remote images, and training and education. There are many reasons why enterprise users are adopting Smart Glasses, such as for:

• | Increasing productivity;
--+-------------------------


• | Eliminating travel costs;
--+--------------------------


• | Improving worker safety;
--+-------------------------


• | Lowering carbon footprint;
--+---------------------------


• | Reducing worker errors; and
--+----------------------------


• | Protecting worker health
--+-------------------------

Medical
The healthcare industry continues to be an early adopter of Smart Glasses to deliver a variety of benefits in and outside of the operating room. Our Smart Glasses are being used in operating rooms to enable MedTech experts, assisting surgeons, medical student training, patient care, and other healthcare professionals to see and communicate with surgeons in real-time. This unique solution empowers surgeons, medical device specialists, and other experts to work together remotely without incurring costly expenses to commute on-sight for consultations and surgeries. Our Smart Glasses are also being used in telemedicine for remote calls made to provide a virtual presence within hospitals and senior care facilities that are video broadcast securely. Further, our Smart Glasses provide virtual training, health care for patients in the ICU and the operating room, and assistance in performing virtual patient rounds.
Security and First Responders
Our Smart Glasses, particularly the versions that have a sunglass look, have the potential to become disruptive and market changing products for security providers and first responders such as police and firefighters. We believe there are significant business opportunities in having the Vuzix smart glasses offering a traditional eyeglass unique form factor that can assist law enforcement and security personnel in keeping people safe or identifying suspicious persons or those associated with unlawful activities. The ability to deliver video feeds and real-time facial recognition and weapons detection alerts in a covert fashion to our smart glasses wearers literally provides security personnel and first responders with eyes in the back of their heads, allowing them to view and interact with their immediate surroundings while also staying remotely connected and informed.
Consumer
We believe that the most significant driver of longer-term wearable display market adoption that will change the future of computing and will result in broad adoption of AR smart glasses in smaller wearable packages will be the augmentation of the real world with cloud-based information. This capability will allow smart phone users to be able to keep their phones in their pocket and at the same time still receive location-aware content overlaid with their real-world view. These glasses are expected to be ideal for consumer needs such as language translation, closed captioning, messaging, directions, health reporting, and workout status, amongst many other things. The advent of AI programs such as OpenAI and ChatGPT are expected to, if anything, create awareness that could significantly accelerate this demand in the upcoming years. We believe that the keys to the consumer AR market are fashion forward light weight smart glasses that have the ability to support the user’s prescription. Vuzix new OEM solutions offerings are pointed directly at solving for these needs.

OEM Waveguide Optics and Display Engines
We believe our waveguide and display engine technologies address the critical performance parameters for next generation AR products, including higher brightness, sharper resolution, true see-through capabilities, compact size, lower power consumption and longer operational life. As we manufacture our waveguides and display engines in higher volumes at reduced costs and capitalize on our waveguide manufacturing expertise, we believe that our products will be increasingly well-positioned to compete with other see-through optics and displays, particularly as demand expands for sophisticated mobile computing devices offering higher resolution and better image quality for AR/XR and Smart Glasses applications. We are developing, with partners, new micro LED display technologies that should greatly increase the ability to offer high resolution displays that can overlay AR information and graphics to wearers in nearly any environment. The goal is to have extremely efficient full color micro displays capable of high brightness for use in any conditions. We believe that our waveguide and display engine technologies address the critical performance parameters for next generation AR products, including higher brightness, sharper resolution, true see-through capabilities, compact size, lower power consumption and longer life.
​
Products
We produce and sell AR Smart Glasses for a variety of applications. Our products are available with varying features and are currently offered as both monocular and binocular display systems.
Our current products include:
M400 and M4000 Smart Glasses (M series)
The M400 and M4000 (the current “M series”) products are our monocular smart glasses designed for enterprise, industrial, commercial, and medical markets. The M400 is Vuzix’ work-horse Smart Glasses offering with its enhanced capabilities and is our fourth model in this family. This product began commercial production in September 2019 and the M4000 was introduced to the market and entered volume production in September 2020. The M400 is equipped with an occluded nHD OLED display and the M4000 employs our latest see-through waveguide optics with a WVGA DMD display. These two products include an Android-based wearable computer similar in performance to a modern smart phone, enhanced with a wearable monocular display, speech control, camera, sensors and wireless connectivity capabilities. These Smart Glasses serve up the digital world “hands-free”, offering access to information to augment the real world, data collection and more. Monocular products, due to their single eye display, are best used for push notifications and “information snacking”. Integrated head tracking, camera, touchpad, buttons and speech recognition gives versatility to navigate and use these M-series Smart Glasses in almost any environment. These products include pre-installed apps that can be used to record and play-back still pictures and broadcast quality video, track timed events, manage a user’s calendar, link to a phone, scan barcodes and much more. We offer connector applications, with annual subscriptions, that allow the smart glasses to join the most popular video conferencing applications including Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Blue Jeans, WebEx Teams and others. These products can provide enhancements to existing workflows and open new opportunities in industrial, medical, retail, supply chain, remote help desk, and many more aspects of our customers’ businesses.

Applications for Smart Glasses
Dozens of standard applications that are optimized for use with the growing lineup of Vuzix AR Smart Glasses are included on the devices and available for download from the Vuzix App Store. Many of these applications are similar to what is available to the customer with modern smart phones. These standard applications are designed to be simple to get started and easy-to-use, and we believe can immediately provide the fundamental benefits of Smart Glasses to novice and expert users alike.
Vuzix also resells a variety of other applications, including TeamViewer Frontline and Vuzix Remote Assist (VRA), which provide remote telepresence capabilities, otherwise known as “see-what-I-see” video collaboration and work instructions, amongst other features. VRA enables an operator, mechanic, field technician or consultant to communicate in a hands-free manner with a remote expert to drive “just-in-time” video support of a process or repair. These applications increase productivity and customer satisfaction by sharing information between field technicians and remote support experts. The VRA app enables Vuzix Smart Glasses customers to multiply their expert workforce, eliminate the high costs of travel, improve customer service levels and equipment operation and accelerate knowledge transfer and training. We are offering the VRA app on a monthly or one-year subscription basis. We have also developed “connector” applications to enable third party applications like Zoom, Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Teams, BlueJeans and others, for use with our smart glasses. In some cases these applications will be free to the user and in others we will charge annual fees.
Vuzix’ position as a Smart Glasses supplier fills a market need that can be long lasting and could be the basis of the future of computing if the glasses are developed into a much larger integration within current and future technology ecosystems. The idea that the Smart Glasses alone will lead to major innovations and use cases is a typical “chicken and egg scenario” that has played out in almost every massively disruptive technology advancement. The “build it and they will come” mentality works only when you build the “whole thing” or if you have a large enough ecosystem. Vuzix’ Smart Glasses have all the features and benefits consumers expect of a modern tablet or smart phone with the added benefit of being worn ergonomically on one’s head, allowing for hands-free operation, and at the same time connecting the visuals in the glasses to the real world. The steady advances in the Smart Glasses hardware are impressive but this alone is not what is driving market adoption to date. The “whole thing” is the solution to solve the customer pain point, problems and/or inefficiencies while simultaneously creating another use case in the form of a toolbox that allows for new innovations or products.
We believe Vuzix is gaining market awareness and has the opportunity to move up the value chain, increase market share and to create a sustainable higher software subscription margin business by:

● | Properly implementing a digital solution strategy that retains more of the customer relationship across a wide range of industries; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Improving Vuzix’ participation in more areas of the customer relationship and having less reliance on VARs to deliver the full solution. When VARs are heavily involved in the middle of the relationship, Vuzix is primarily relegated to being a product manufacturer and seller. There is significant customer value that can be captured by adopting a solutions model including recurring revenue opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

App Store for Smart Glasses
We also have an app store on our website where users can download and purchase Smart Glasses applications, including third-party apps. We continue to foster the development of an ecosystem of third-party developers to offer applications and trials for their smart glasses apps, many of which will be sold on an industry common revenue share model, with the publisher receiving approximately 70% of the subscriptions collected. Supported by Vuzix’ new App Store, developers can offer or sell their applications to all Vuzix Smart Glasses users, expanding into an ecosystem of AR applications for real world use today. The app store supports free, one-time fee, and paid subscription monetization models. The Vuzix third-party developer community is able to leverage the open Android platform of the Vuzix M-Series and the Vuzix Blade to bring new and creative ideas to life.

Waveguide Optics, Display Engines and Design Reference Kits
We selectively offer waveguide optics and related coupling optics combined with our compact proprietary display engine to form a see-through display module. We sell limited numbers of our waveguide optic design reference kits to select qualified potential OEMs/ODMs, which include a projector, waveguide optics and associated electronics, to help these customers evaluate our technologies and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our proprietary solutions.
Our strategy for addressing the broader mass market includes developing partnerships with both select consumer companies, including wireless communications carriers, and select high volume production manufacturing companies.
Custom Solutions and Engineering Solutions
Historically, we have provided fully-integrated wearable display systems, including head mounted displays, human computer interface devices, near-eye display-related engineering services and wearable computers to commercial, industrial and medical customers. Starting in June 2022 after the expiry of a 10-year non-compete, we are again able to market and sell to defense, first responders and security customers. Such potential customers include police, fire fighters, EMTs, other first responders, and homeland and border security personnel.
We have an outward facing section of our website dedicated to offering our OEM and engineering services around our waveguides and display technologies. Waveguides require a display engine built for the purpose of the intended design. Vuzix is able to address most of these design specifications regardless of size, light coupling, power consumption, or resolution.
Defense and Security Products
As noted above, in June 2022, the 10-year non-compete restrictions with the buyer of our former defense division, TDG Acquisition LLC (DBA – Six15 Technologies (“Six15”)) expired. This allows us to again pursue, on an unrestricted basis, opportunities related to the Company’s smart glasses and waveguide optics technologies into these expanded market opportunities related to first responders, US Department of Defense, Security Organizations and the Military.
Product Development
We believe that the continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. Our products tend to have two to three-year life cycles. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with external consultants to continue our product development efforts. Our primary development efforts are focused on waveguide optics (and their manufacture), projection engines, new micro LED-display technologies, low-power electronic designs, firmware and wearable computing software, and the design and ergonomics of wearable displays. Our display product development efforts are focused towards continually enhancing the resolution, performance and manufacturability of our display products. We expect to increase our research and development expenditures in the future and as our revenues grow. We have also acquired and licensed technologies developed by third parties and we may continue to do so in the future.
Technology
We believe that it is important to make substantial investments in research and development to maintain our competitive advantage. The development and procurement of intellectual property rights relating to our technologies is a key aspect of our business strategy. We expect to continue to improve our products through our ongoing research and development and advancements made by our third-party suppliers of key components.
We believe that the range of our proprietary technologies gives us a significant competitive advantage. Our technologies relate to advanced optics systems including passive and active see-through imaging waveguides, micro-

​



projection display engines, investments in micro LED displays, and specialized software drivers and applications for wearable displays and computers. We also have a portfolio of trade secrets and expertise in nano-imprinting using high stability mold substrates, nano structure embossing, and engineering tool-sets for the design and manufacturing of diffractive waveguide optics. 
We believe that display engines are also important for commercializing wearable displays. We have developed a proprietary micro digital light processing (DLP) based engine and micro LED engines designed specifically for our waveguide optics solutions. We are currently working with multiple partners in the micro LED arena and unveiled our first micro LED display-based binocular AR Smart Glasses called the Shield as well as the Vuzix Ultralite at CES 2023. These next generation waveguides and Micro LED display engines have allowed us to shrink the entire assembly to fit in the space available in a typical off-the-shelf pair of sports sunglasses in the case of the Shield and reading glasses in the case of the Ultralite.
We entered into a technology license agreement with Nokia Corporation in August 2011 for their Exit Pupil Expanding (EPE) optics technology. This agreement was amended in October 2017 to allow us greater flexibility with sub-licensing and preferable royalty terms. EPE technology is an important foundation of our diffraction-based waveguide optics technology.
In October 2017 and June 2021, we acquired certain IP and patent applications from the inventor/seller related to holographic optics and display engines for “image and wave field projection through a diffusive media”. This technology is still in active development and we are making progress towards our first functional solution.
On May 12, 2022, the Company signed a series of agreements with Atomistic SAS, a French company that is developing new micro LED displays and a related backplane. These agreements provided for an exclusive license by the Company of key micro LED technology and for the custom design of a backplane, for cash commitments totaling $30 million along with equity issuance commitments to be made by the Company relating to certain deliverables and the achievement of performance milestones by Atomistic. On December 16, 2022, the Company signed new agreements with Atomistic (the “Atomistic Agreements”) that superseded the prior May 12, 2022 agreements, whereby the scope for the construction of a backplane was modified and the Company obtained an additional license in an alternative self-emissive micro LED technology. This multi-year project, if this new IP proves out, could result in industry-leading very efficient full color HD micro LED displays in an extremely small form-factor.
​
Major technologies that we employ in our products include:
Micro-display Optics: Optical components represent a significant cost of goods for both us and our competitors. This cost is a function of the physical size of the micro-display and the cost of the supporting optics. We have developed thin and lightweight optics that can be integrated with very small micro-displays where we can more closely match conventional eyewear frames in size and weight. These new optics and displays provide what we believe are significantly improved ergonomics compared to competing wearable display solutions.
See-Through Waveguides: We have developed a range of patents and patents-pending around our see-through waveguides, as well as passive, dynamic and diffractive optics-based waveguides that are the basis for some of our future slim wearable display AR and smart glasses products. We are striving to develop ultra-compact micro-display engines to magnify and focus the light from a display into a user’s eye. Our development goal with these waveguides is to create AR-based wearable displays that will appear to others as practically indistinguishable from today’s conventional sunglasses by most measures, including comfort, size, weight and ergonomics.
Nanoimprinting: We continue to develop a portfolio of trade secrets and expertise in nanoimprinting for use in our waveguide optics. We believe these technologies are essential to the production of our approximately 1.2 mm thick see-through lenses which we believe are the cornerstone to making fashionable eyeglass-styled Smart Glasses. We have developed technology for waveguide design and production, including: tool design and creation, custom designed software for grating structures and layout, lithography processes, high index low shrinkage polymers and other materials, mold treatments, automation equipment and test/QA processes and procedures, to name a few.

Custom Display Engines: We have patents and patents-pending on intellectual property around micro DLP display engines. We have also worked on very compact micro LED projectors and are also working on micro LED engines designed specifically for our waveguide optics solutions. We are currently working with multiple partners on micro LED engines, both monochrome and color, and have delivered preliminary evaluation systems to select partners and potential OEM customers.
Patents and other Intellectual Property
We have an intellectual property policy which has as its objectives: (i) the development of new intellectual property to further our intellectual property position in relation to personal display technology; and (ii) the maintenance and protection of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. We seek to achieve these objectives through the education and training of our engineering staff and the adoption of appropriate systems, policies and procedures for the creation, identification, and protection of intellectual property.
Our general practice is to file patent applications for our technology in the United States, Europe, Japan, and in additional countries, including Canada and China for inventions which we believe have the greatest potential. We file and prosecute our patent applications in pursuit of the most extensive fields of protection possible including, where appropriate, the application of the relevant technology to the broader display industry.
We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our supplier relationships and accumulated experience in the near-eye display field, gives us an advantage over potential competitors. We also believe our copyrights, trademarks, and patents are critical to our success and we intend to maintain and protect these. We also rely on proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how, including manufacturing processes and procedures, which are not patented. To protect our rights in these areas, we require all employees and, where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators, to enter into confidentiality, invention assignment, and non-competition agreements with us.
Our technologies enable us to provide low-cost, small form factor, high-resolution wearable display products. To protect our technologies, we have developed a patent portfolio which currently consists of 148 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 130 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. We are also currently preparing several invention disclosures for the purposes of submitting design and utility patent applications. Our U.S. and foreign patents expire on various dates to January 24, 2040. In addition, in connection with the sale of our defense division in 2012, we received a worldwide, royalty-free, assignable grant-back license to all the patents and other intellectual property sold for use in the manufacture and sale of products in the consumer markets.
In addition to our various patents, we have 7 registered U.S. trademarks and 79 trademark registrations worldwide.
Competitors
The near-eye wearable computer or personal display and mobile device industry in which we operate is highly competitive and evolving rapidly. We compete against both direct view display technology in smart phones and tablets and wearable display technology. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the personal display industry include image size, image quality, image resolution, power efficiency, manufacturing cost, weight and dimension, feature implementation, AR capabilities, ergonomics, style, hands-free capabilities and, lastly, the interactive capabilities of the overall display system.
Aside from direct view displays, we also have competitors who produce near-eye personal displays or wearable displays. For the past decade, most of these products were mainly low-resolution, bulky in size, ergonomically deficient, costly, and heavy in their power requirements.

Competition – Binocular Wearable Display Products
Vuzix AR Smart Glasses competitors include binocular wearable displays and virtual reality systems, using micro-displays or smaller flat panels. Examples of such companies include or have included Carl Zeiss, Seiko Epson (Epson), Sony Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Avegant Corp., Meta (formerly Oculus/Facebook), HTC Corporation, Razer Inc., HP, Lenovo and many others. Some of these firms have discontinued their efforts while others continue to introduce new products. We believe that most these competitive products have received limited customer acceptance, except for Meta’s products, due to their being bulky, limited operating time, and when connected to a computer, extra cables. Despite their size, VR headsets from companies like Meta and Sony have been selling in the millions of units, primarily for game applications. VR systems are either standalone devices or require a wire to be connected to a PC to operate. To date, the most popular units have been standalone devices from Meta which incorporate a computer similar to the ones used in our smart glasses products.
Competition – AR Glasses
In the AR markets, there are currently few competitors with most of this market currently aimed at the high-end and research markets. Companies that have offered or are offering products or intend to do so in this area include Microsoft Corporation, Sony Corporation, Epson, Lenovo, Magic Leap, Nreal and CastAR. Further, industry watchers have speculated that companies such as Apple, Google, Snap, and Meta may offer or support AR wearable display products in the future, but to date, no specific product launch details have been officially announced. Today, many of these products are fairly bulky and are typically tethered to an external controller. Some are using external view cameras to simulate an AR environment where the wearer can see the outside world in effectively a pair of VR goggles with limited success thus far. The Meta Quest Pro announced in fall of 2022 is an example of this and it retails for $1,500. Many are being sold as AR Smart Glasses and are currently targeted at enterprise and academic researchers. The most complete and functional systems today are the Microsoft Hololens II and the Magic Leap Two, both of which cost $2,295 - $3,500 per unit. And Magic Leap 2 for Enterprise starts at $4,999 and higher based upon features purchased.
Competition – Monocular Smart Glasses and Wearable Display Products
Although several companies produce monocular wearable displays, we believe that the market opportunity for these products, other than night vision products, has been limited primarily to trial tests and smaller rollouts in enterprise markets rather than broad commercial volume purchases. Competitors in these markets include or have included: Google/Alphabet, Lenovo, RealWear, Iristick, Liteye Systems, Inc., Lumus, Zebra Technologies (inclusive of the business unit formerly part of Motorola), Six-15 Technologies, LLC (the purchaser of our defense division), Optinvent, Shimadzu Corporation, Sony Corporation, Kopin Corporation, tooz technologies GmbH, Creative Display Systems, Brother, Garmin, BAE Systems, Focals by North (acquired by Google), and Rockwell Collins. 
Several Japanese electronics companies including Hitachi, Murata Manufacturing Co., Sony Corporation, WESTUNITIS, and Olympus have or had announced monocular smart glasses systems for industry and many have exited the business over the last three years. There are also several China-based companies that have been showing monocular smart glasses products, including Lenovo but their sales activities thus far have been somewhat limited and focused primarily on Asia. We expect that we will encounter competition in the future from major consumer electronics companies and suppliers of imaging and information products for defense applications.
There is competition in all types of products we manufacture, from both large and small companies. The principal points of competition for these products include, among other factors: price, product performance, the availability of supporting applications, and the experience and brand name of the particular company and history of its dealings in such products. We believe that our monocular products match or exceed the display products currently offered by our competitors.
Competition – Waveguides and Display Engines
There are a limited number of manufacturers of waveguide optics, all targeted at OEM producers of AR and smart glasses. Competitors to our waveguide products include Lumus, WaveOptics (acquired by Snap), Digilens, 

11
​



Dispelix, Optinvent and several others. In addition, several new waveguide manufacturers from China have begun demonstrating their solutions at recent trade shows. Snap Inc. recently purchased WaveOptics and it appears that Snap is planning to use such waveguides for their own internal solutions and likely no longer will be competitive as a waveguide component supplier.
Sales and Marketing
Sales
Our strategy is to sell our products and components both directly and through distributors and value-added resellers (VARs – also referred to as Vuzix Integration Partners or VIPs), and on a select basis to OEMs. As a result, we have distinct strategies for the sales of our products.
In the Smart Glasses and AR markets, we are currently focused on the enterprise space and as such are building strategic marketing relationships with software firms and distributors to address and support enterprise customers. We are, in parallel, supporting a VAR network with leading companies in various vertical markets from warehousing to field service to medical. These VARs provide their software and services offerings to their respective customer bases. We are also supporting select larger key accounts and distributors with our in-house direct sales team. For our Smart Glasses, we continue to foster an ecosystem with application developers from around the world. We also have our own hosted application store where our Smart Glasses customers can download and purchase applications and software developer kits.
We currently sell our products internationally through resellers, distributors, direct to commercial customers, and via online stores and various Vuzix operated web stores in the USA, Europe and Japan. Our international focus is currently on Japan and the EMEA (including the UK, Europe, Middle East and Africa). In Japan, we have a branch sales and service office and a small warehouse in Tokyo. We have a wholly-owned subsidiary, Vuzix (Europe) Limited, through which we conduct our business in the EU and Middle Eastern markets. We maintain small European sales offices in Oxford, England and Munich, Germany that are staffed by full-time sales consultants or employees. For warehousing, we have contracted with a third-party fulfillment center based in the UK and the Netherlands to service our customers in the EMEA. We also currently serve other APAC customers through North American West Coast and Tokyo sales offices.
For customer support for the EMEA, we have contracted with a third-party end-user technical support firm that provides sixteen (16) hours of customer and technical support daily.
We intend to primarily provide our Vuzix Ultralite OEM platform, waveguide and miniature display engine modules and optics components to select OEMs to incorporate into their branded products and sell through their own well-established distribution channels. An OEM/ODM design cycle typically requires between 6 and 24 months, depending upon the uniqueness of the market, and the complexity of the end product. Because our waveguides and display engines are the main functional component that define the imaging as well as look and feel of many of our potential OEM customers' end products, we intend to work closely with these customers to provide technical assistance throughout their product evaluation and any eventual integration process.
We believe that the technical nature of our OEM products, including waveguides and display projectors with micro-displays, demands close relationships with such customers. Our sales and marketing staff, assisted by our technical staff and senior management, visit prospective and existing customers worldwide on a regular basis. We believe these contacts are vital to the development of a close, long-term working relationship with our OEM customers, and in securing accurate and regular forecasts, market updates and information regarding technical and market trends. We also participate in industry specific trade shows and conferences.
Marketing
Our marketing and sales group, in conjunction with external firms, is responsible for product management, planning, advertising, marketing communications, and public relations. We have both internal and external public 

12
​



relations efforts in the U.S. and UK. We also employ marketing firms to help prepare brochures, packaging, tradeshow messaging and advertising campaigns, focused on either the enterprise or consumer end markets. Most of our products are currently sold under the Vuzix brand name. We seek to have Vuzix become known as one of the premier suppliers of wearable display products for enterprise applications and AR smart glasses. We currently undertake specific marketing activities as needed, including, but not limited to:

● | product reviews, case studies and promotions in trade publications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | case studies and white papers on successful enterprise uses of Smart Glasses and AR;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product and technology views for our website and social media;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | internet search engine ads and social media advertising and targeted emails;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | public relations; and
--+----------------------


● | trade shows and event sponsorships.
--+------------------------------------

We engage in select marketing efforts that are intended to drive customers to our products and to help to grow awareness of our AR Smart Glasses and wearable displays in general. Public relations and product videos are an important aspect of our marketing and we intend to continue to distribute samples of our products to key industry participants. 
Our Smart Glasses are sold through distributors, valued-added resellers, direct to end customers, through our webstore, and through a limited number of third-party online stores, such as Amazon. Our website, www.vuzix.com, is an important part of our direct sales efforts.
Engineering Services and OEM Products
We primarily respond to sales inquiries for our engineering services programs and OEM component requests directly and usually in response to inbound inquiries. We do not offer “works for hire” services at Vuzix but rather offer our services to opportunities that could result in advancing our technology or develop into a long-term supply or OEM relationship. We believe that we have established a strong reputation for quality, performance, and innovation for wearable near-eye display systems, waveguides, and display engines that will be attractive to many types of commercial users who want to leverage our services and products within their businesses. We continue to receive inbound requests for engagement related to our proprietary waveguide optics and miniature display engines from some of the world’s largest consumer and mobile electronics firms. Our business strategy is to commercialize our waveguide and display engine technologies and products to permit select ODMs and OEMs to integrate and embed our technologies and products in a way that best matches their unique capabilities and timeline for bringing their products to market. Our design and engineering staff are actively involved with customers during all phases of prototype design through to production by providing engineering data, up-to-date product application notes, regular follow-up and technical assistance.
Manufacturing
We purchase product components from our suppliers, engage third-party contract manufacturing firms to perform electronic circuit board and cable assemblies, and now do the final assembly of our products primarily in our West Henrietta, New York facility. We are experienced in the successful production of our products in moderate volumes. Our current facilities are capable of producing tens of thousands of finished products annually, and we believe producing out of these facilities at these levels is more economical and easier to manage than through third parties. We also manufacture all of our waveguide optics in our cleanroom environments at our West Henrietta, New York facility. We evaluate contract manufacturers and component suppliers on an ongoing basis, including whether or not to utilize new or alternative contract manufacturers or component suppliers. However, we also expect to manufacture all of our 

13
​



waveguide optics only at our West Henrietta, New York facility. In October 2022, we announced the signing of a new lease agreement for additional floor space in a building adjacent to our West Henrietta facility for the express purpose of expanding our waveguide production capacity.
We currently purchase almost all of the micro-displays used in our products from Sony Corporation, Jade Bird Display and Texas Instruments. Our relationship with these micro-display suppliers is generally on a purchase order basis and none have a contractual obligation to provide adequate supply or acceptable pricing to us on a long-term basis, nor do we have any contractual obligation to purchase micro-displays from them. We have operated this way for over a decade with these suppliers. Our Cobra II display engine is based on our proprietary design and is exclusively manufactured for us by a firm in Asia and it incorporates a DLP engine from Texas Instruments. We generally procure our other non-micro-display components and products from our vendors on a purchase order basis without any long-term commitments. Many of the raw materials used in our components are standard to the consumer electronics and computer industry. We provide forecasts that allow our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials and plan capacity. Our contract manufacturers procure raw materials in volumes consistent with our forecasts, manufacture and/or assemble the products and perform tests according to our specifications. In some cases, we procure specific components and either sell them or consign them to our contract manufacturers. Products are either shipped to our customers or shipped to our West Henrietta, New York facility to be inventoried as finished goods. We currently use several manufacturing sources in Asia where we have located some of our tooling.
While we do not manufacture our components, other than waveguides, we do own the tooling that is used to make our custom components. Some of our accessory products are sourced from third parties as finished goods. We typically have them print our Vuzix brand name on these products if they are co-branded. Such third-party products represented less than 5% of our sales in last three fiscal years.
Our manufacturing is not currently subject to seasonal variations, but in the future, depending upon our customers’ product mix, we may be affected by seasonal fluctuations which could affect working capital demands.
​
Backlog
There is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment of our product sales. Most purchase orders we receive are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties. In regard to sales of custom products and waveguides to our OEM customers, we believe that the backlog metric is currently of limited utility in predicting future sales because all these OEM customers operate on a ship-to-order basis. Therefore, we believe at this time that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.
Employees
As of March 1, 2023, we had 105 full-time employees in North America, of which 50 are in research and development and engineering services support. In Japan we have 2 full-time employees to manage our Asian sales activities. In Europe we have 2 full-time employees and 2 full-time contractors to manage our European sales and marketing activities.
Available Information
We make available free of charge through our website, www.vuzix.com, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our proxy statements and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished, as well as certain of our corporate governance policies, including the charters for the Board of Directors’ audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees and our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and whistleblower policy. We will also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of any of the foregoing materials.
