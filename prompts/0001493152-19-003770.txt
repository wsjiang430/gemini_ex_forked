ITEM 1. Business
About Our Business and How We Talk About It
 
We deliver interactive entertainment and innovative technology, including performance analytics and secure payment with Europay, MasterCard® and Visa® (EMV) chip card readers or with near-field communication (NFC) technology to accept Apple, Android and Samsung Pay. Our tablets and technology offer engaging solutions to establishments with guests who experience dwell time, such as bars, restaurants, casinos and senior living centers. Casual dining venues subscribe to our customizable solution to differentiate themselves via competitive fun by offering guests trivia, card, sports and arcade games, customized menus and self-service dining features. Our platform improves operating efficiencies, creates connections among the players and venues, and amplifies guests’ positive experiences. We continue to support our legacy network product line, which we call our Classic platform.
 
We generate revenue by charging subscription fees for our service to network subscribers, by leasing tablet platform equipment to certain network subscribers, by selling tablet platform equipment, by hosting live trivia events, by selling advertising aired on in-venue screens and as part of customized games, by licensing our content for use with third-party equipment, from providing professional services (such as developing certain functionality within our platform for customers), and from pay-to-play arcade games.
 
Since 2016, over 115 million games were played on our network annually, and as of December 31, 2018, approximately 56% of our network subscriber venues are affiliated with national and regional restaurant brands, including Buffalo Wild Wings, Buffalo Wings & Rings, Old Chicago, Native Grill & Wings, Houlihans, Beef O’Brady’s, Boston Pizza, and Arooga’s.
 
We own several trademarks and consider the Buzztime®, Playmaker®, Mobile Playmaker, and BEOND Powered by Buzztime trademarks to be among our most valuable assets. These and our other registered and unregistered trademarks used in this document are our property. Other trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

Recent Developments
 
Strategic Process
 
On December 7, 2018, we announced that our board of directors is exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value, including, among other things, a potential acquisition of our company or our assets, and that we engaged a financial advisor to assist in the process. The strategic process is ongoing. Our board of directors has not set a timetable for the strategic process nor has it made any decisions relating to any strategic alternatives at this time, and no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the process. We do not intend to disclose additional details regarding the strategic process unless and until further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.
New Term Loan
 
In September 2018, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Avidbank that provides for a one-time $4,000,000 48-month term loan, all of which we used to pay-off the $4,050,000 of principal we borrowed from East West Bank (“EWB”). We used our cash on hand to pay the remaining $50,000 we borrowed from EWB plus accrued and unpaid interest. We granted and pledged to Avidbank a first-priority security interest in all our existing and future personal property, and, subject to customary exceptions, we are prohibited from borrowing additional indebtedness. In connection with entering into the loan and security agreement with Avidbank, the amended and restated loan and security agreement we entered into with EWB on November 29, 2017, as amended on March 12, 2018, terminated on September 28, 2018.
 
For additional information regarding our Avidbank credit facility, see “PART II—ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” below.
 
Our Strategy
 
Below is a discussion of our strategy and highlights of accomplishments and milestones achieved during 2018:
 
Grow business beyond restaurant and bar industry. One of our major initiatives has been and continues to be to expand our business beyond the restaurant and bar industry through partnerships and product extensions. During the first quarter of 2018, we agreed to sell our tablets to a third-party who will use our tablets and operating system to deliver their services in local jails. In July 2018, we entered into a revenue share agreement with this partner, under which our partner will make our single player games available for a fee to inmates. Earlier in 2017, we began a relationship with a third-party who is licensing our trivia content for use in casino gaming machines and is leasing our tablets for use in retail settings to complete loyalty/reward program transactions.
 
Launch expanded product offerings. We continue to focus on developing new experiences and new products that we believe will help differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and will provide us the ability to scale our business beyond our traditional entertainment offering.
 
New SiteHub. Our content is streamed to tablets within a venue from a personal computer within the venue. During 2018, we redesigned that personal computer to make it substantially smaller, about the size of a deck of cards. Besides reducing labor-intensive installation costs associated with our traditional computer, we expect to offer our redesigned personal computer, which we call SiteHub, to customers at a lower cost compared to our traditional personal computer. We believe that if we can successfully commercially launch SiteHub, it will lead to new opportunities, which could include the ability to display video, highlights, dynamic web content, and app content, in addition to delivering our historical offerings within venues. We have been testing the first version of SiteHub in-house and are preparing for a field test in certain venues in San Diego County during the second quarter of 2019.
 
Mobile Offerings.
 

● | Mobile Live. We are developing a mobile version of our live trivia product that allows customers and trivia hosts to start their own trivia events. These events usually take place in a single venue and the experience is tied to that venue. Our mobile live product is intended to improve the experience by replacing pen and paper, providing more impressions and registrations, and allowing our customers to know who is participating in the event. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Mobile Trivia. We are developing a version of our system that allows players to use their own mobile device to play our network games inside our customers’ venues. 

 
When these mobile offerings become available commercially, they will be our easiest to adopt, lowest cost of entry solutions, and may serve as a test for a venue contemplating a more significant investment.
 
Single Player Games. During the second quarter of 2018, we released our first internally-built single player arcade game, Buzztime Soccer, for our tablet platform, and we expect to release several more internally-built single player games in the coming weeks. Previously, we purchased these games from third party aggregators, sometimes at significant cost.

Buffalo Wild Wings. In March 2017, Buffalo Wild Wings chose us to be its provider of digital menu, order, and payment functionality. In November 2017, we expected to begin rolling out our improved tablet platform system at certain Buffalo Wild Wings locations during the first quarter of 2018 and, after an initial set of locations was running smoothly, throughout the rest of the Buffalo Wild Wings corporate and franchise locations with which we had partnered. Due to the acquisition of Buffalo Wild Wings by Arby’s Restaurant Group, Inc. (which renamed itself Inspire Brands Inc.) in February 2018 and to the associated changes with Buffalo Wild Wings’ operations, the rollout of our expanded functionality tablet platform system was put on hold to allow its new ownership to assess all the programs at Buffalo Wild Wings. The order, payment and guest insights functionality available through our improved tablet system was deployed in a pilot study at 31 Buffalo Wild Wings locations between April 2018 and September 2018. In October 2018, Buffalo Wild Wings informed us that it determined not to rollout our order, payment and guest insights functionality and that its relationship with us would continue in accordance with existing agreements we entered into in the ordinary course of business, and which terminate in accordance with their terms in November 2019.
 
Advertising Partnerships. We believe that if we lower the price of our tablet platform, we can acquire more market share. One way to lower the price is by subsidizing our costs through advertising. We are currently working with advertising sales companies to help us improve our advertisement sales and with an advertisement technology company to improve our ad loading, management, and delivery and testing capabilities.
 
Products and Services
 
Our principal product and service is our tablet platform. Built on an extended network platform, our interactive entertainment system offers trivia, card, sports and arcade games, customized menus and self-service dining features, including dynamic menus, touchscreen ordering and secure payment. Generally, as part of the subscription to our tablet platform, we provide the equipment for the platform to network subscribers (including tablets, cases and charging trays for the tablets), though we also lease such equipment to certain network subscribers. In 2017, we began licensing our content to customers to be installed on equipment they obtain from other parties. In 2018, we began selling the equipment used in our tablet platform to customers who may not subscribe to our services but who can use the equipment in their business for other purposes.
 
Our primary network subscribers are bars and restaurants in North America, which we target directly through our internal sales organization. In April 2016, we begun offering our tablet platform in adjacent markets, such as senior centers and casinos, which we target through third parties who have existing business relationships with potential customers in such markets.
 
We primarily develop the content and functionality available through our tablet platform internally. We use an Android-based tablet customized to our specifications by a single unaffiliated third-party manufacturer. Such third-party also manufacturers the cases and charging trays for the tablets and sources the raw materials used to manufacture those cases and trays. See “ITEM 1A., Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business—A disruption in the supply of equipment could negatively impact our subscriptions and revenue, and —Our business could be adversely impacted if the sole manufacturer of our customized tablet and tablet equipment is not able to meet our manufacturing quality standards,” below.
 
Competition
 
We face direct competition in venues and face competition for total entertainment and marketing dollars in the marketplace from other companies offering similar content and services. A relatively small number of direct competitors are active in the hospitality marketing services and entertainment markets, including Ziosk and E la Carte, Inc. Competing forms of technology, entertainment, and marketing available in hospitality venues include games, apps and other forms of entertainment offerings available directly to consumers on their smart phones and tablets, on-table bar and restaurant entertainment systems, music and video-based systems, live entertainment and games, cable, satellite and pay-per-view programming, coin-operated single-player games/amusements, and traffic-building promotions like happy hour specials and buffets.
Buzztime Significant Customer
 
Our customers range from small independently operated bars and restaurants to bars and restaurants operated by national chains. This results in diverse venue sizes and locations. As of December 31, 2018, 2,639 venues in the U.S. and Canada subscribed to our interactive entertainment network, of which, approximately 46% were Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees. In October 2018, Buffalo Wild Wings informed us that it determined not to rollout our order, payment and guest insights functionality and that its relationship with us would continue in accordance with existing agreements we entered into in the ordinary course of business, and which terminate in accordance with their terms in November 2019. See “ITEM 1A., Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business—We receive a significant portion of our revenues from Buffalo Wild Wings corporate-owned restaurants and its franchisees, and, absent an extension, our relationship will terminate in November 2019.”

Backlog
 
We generally do not have a significant backlog because we normally can deliver and install new systems at venues within the delivery schedule requested by customers (generally within three to four weeks).
Licensing, Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents
 
A majority of the gaming content available on our platform is internally developed. The balance is licensed from third parties. We also license third party content for our pay-to-play and free-to-consumer games lobby. The amounts paid for such third-party licensed content was not material during either of the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.
 
Our intellectual property assets, including patents, trademarks, and copyrights, are important to our business and, accordingly, we actively seek to protect the proprietary technology we consider important to our business. No single patent or copyright is solely responsible for protecting our products.
 
We keep confidential as trade secrets our technology, know-how and software. Most of the hardware we use in our tablet platform is purchased from a third party and customized for use with our service. We enter into agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business, which contain provisions designed to protect our intellectual property and to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors.
 
We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. We consider the following United States patents to be important to the protection of our products and service:
 

Patent No. | Description | Expiration Date
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------
8,562,438 | System and method for television-based services | 4/21/2031 
8,562,442 | Interactive gaming via mobile playmaker | 6/3/2031 
8,790,186 | User-controlled entertainment system, apparatus and method | 2/6/2034 
8,898,075 | Electronic menu system and method | 9/11/2032 
9,044,681 | System and method for television-based services | 10/13/2033 
9,358,463 | Interactive gaming via mobile playmaker | 10/16/2033 
9,498,713 | User-controlled entertainment system, apparatus and method | 2/6/2034 

 
We have trademark protection for the names of our key proprietary programming, products, and services to the extent that we believe trademark protection is appropriate. We are expanding our efforts to protect these investments. We consider the Buzztime, Playmaker, Mobile Playmaker and PlayersPlus trademarks and our other related trademarks to be valuable assets, and we seek to protect them through a variety of actions. Our content, branding, and some of our game titles, such as Countdown, SIX, and Showdown are also protected by copyright and trademark law.

Government Contracts
 
We provide our content distribution services through our network to colleges, universities, and a few government agencies, typically military base recreation units. However, the number of government customers is small compared to our overall customer base. We provide our products and services to government agencies under contracts with substantially the same terms as are in place with non-government customers.
Government Regulations
 
The cost of compliance with federal, state, and local laws has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date. In December 2012, we received approval from the Federal Communications Commission, or the FCC, for our tablet charging trays, and in September 2015, we received FCC approval for our third-generation tablet cases with and without payment electronics. The tablets we currently use have been certified by its manufacturer.
 
In addition to laws and regulations applicable to businesses generally, we are also subject to laws and regulations that apply directly to the interactive entertainment and product marketing industries. Additionally, state and federal governments may adopt additional laws and regulations that address issues related to certain aspects of our business such as:
 

● | user privacy; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | copyrights; 
● | gaming, lottery and alcohol beverage control regulations; 
● | consumer protection; 
● | the distribution of specific material or content; and 
● | the characteristics and quality of interactive entertainment products and services. 

 
As part of our service, we operate games of chance and skill, including several interactive card games, such as Texas Hold’em poker. These games are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions, and some games are restricted in certain jurisdictions. The laws and regulations that govern these games, however, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change, as well as law enforcement discretion. Most of our games are played solely for fun and winner recognition, however, we recently began awarding nominal cash prizes to winners of certain trivia competitions. We may find it necessary to eliminate, modify, or cancel certain of our offerings in certain jurisdictions based on changes in law, regulations and law enforcement discretion, which could result in additional development costs and/or the possible loss of customers and revenue.
 
Web Site Access to SEC Filings
 
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, and proxy statements and other information we file or furnish pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available on our website at www.buzztime.com/business/investor-relations/ under the heading SEC Filings as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such reports with, or furnish them to, the SEC. In addition, we make available on that same website under the heading Corporate Governance our (i) our code of conduct and ethics; (ii) our corporate governance guidelines; and (iii) the charter of each active committee of our board of directors. We intend to disclose any amendment to, or a waiver from, a provision of our code of conduct and ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the code of ethics definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of Item 406 of Regulation S-K by posting such information on that website.

The SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our company that we file electronically with the SEC.
 
Employees
 
As of March 20, 2019, we had approximately 94 full-time employees and 287 part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors for specific projects. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Our Corporate History
 
NTN Buzztime, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as Alroy Industries and changed its corporate name to NTN Communications, Inc. in 1985. The name was changed to NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2005 to better reflect the growing role of the Buzztime consumer brand.
