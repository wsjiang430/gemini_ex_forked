ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company 
 We are a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”), that acquires, owns, operates, improves and manages multifamily apartment communities across non-gateway U.S. markets.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 58 multifamily apartment properties that contain 15,880 units. Our properties are located in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, Indiana, Texas, Florida, South Carolina, Arkansas, Illinois, Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama. We do not have any foreign operations and our business is not seasonal. Our executive offices are located at Two Liberty Place, 50 S. 16th Street, Suite 3575, Philadelphia, PA 19102 and our telephone number is (267) 270-4800. We have offices in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Chicago, Illinois. 
Our Business Objective and Investment Strategies 
 
Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value through diligent portfolio management, strong operational performance, and a consistent return of capital through distributions and capital appreciation.  Our investment strategy is focused on the following:

• | gaining scale within key amenity rich submarkets of non-gateway cities that offer good school districts, high-quality retail and major employment centers and are unlikely to experience substantial new apartment construction in the foreseeable future;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing cash flows at our existing apartment properties through prudent property management and strategic renovation projects; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | acquiring additional properties that have strong and stable occupancies and support a rise in rental rates or that have the potential for repositioning through capital expenditures or tailored management strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We seek to achieve these objectives by executing the following strategies: 
 
 
• | Focus on properties in markets that have strong apartment demand, reduced competition from national apartment buyers and no substantial new apartment construction. In evaluating potential acquisitions, we analyze apartment occupancy and trends in rental rates, employment and new construction, among many other factors, and seek to identify properties located primarily in non-gateway markets where there is strong demand for apartment units, less apartment development relative to demand, stable resident bases and occupancy rates, positive net migration trends and strong employment drivers. We generally seek to avoid markets where we believe potential yields have decreased as a result of the acquisition and development efforts of large institutional buyers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire properties that have operating upside through targeted management strategies. We have expertise in acquiring and managing properties to maximize the net operating income (the “NOI”) of such properties through effective marketing and leasing, disciplined management of rental rates and efficient expense management. We seek to acquire properties that we believe possess significant prospects for increased occupancy and rental revenue growth. Our target profile for acquisitions currently is midrise/garden-style apartments containing 150-500 units with high quality amenities that we can acquire at less than replacement cost in the $15 million to $50 million price range with a five to fifteen-year operating track record. We do not intend to limit ourselves to properties in this target profile, however, and may make acquisitions outside of this profile or change our target profile whenever market conditions warrant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively use our capital to improve apartment properties where we believe the return on our investment will be accretive to stockholders. We have significant experience allocating capital to value-added improvements of apartment properties to produce better occupancy and rental rates. We will selectively deploy our capital into revenue-enhancing capital projects that we believe will improve the physical plant or market positioning of particular apartment properties and generate increased income over time.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selectively dispose of properties that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when market conditions are favorable. Dispositions also allow us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provide

additional liquidity. In evaluating potential dispositions, we evaluate the opportunity to redeploy sales proceeds to fund acquisitions and developments and reduce our leverage in lieu of raising additional capital.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2018 Developments
 
Value Add Initiative
 During 2018, we made strides in the roll out of our value add initiative, a core component of our growth strategy, which is comprised of renovations and upgrades at selected communities to drive increased rental rates.  We have identified 4,314 units across 14 properties for renovations and upgrades as part of this initiative, and estimate the total investment to complete these renovations and upgrades will aggregate approximately $50.0 million.  As of December 31, 2018, we had completed renovations and upgrades at 1,232 of the 4,314 units. We expect to complete the remaining value add projects at the selected communities during 2019 and through the first half of 2020.
2018 Property Acquisitions
 During 2018, we acquired eight communities, totaling 2,379 units, for a gross purchase price of $272.9 million. The acquisitions expand our reach in existing markets, including Columbus, OH, Tampa, FL, Atlanta, GA, and Indianapolis, IN. The communities were built or renovated between 1986 and 2013. The acquired units had occupancy of 95.7% and had an average effective monthly rent per occupied unit of $991 at the time of acquisition.
2018 Property Dispositions
 During 2018, we disposed of two communities, totaling 516 units, for a gross sale price of $77.3 million. The dispositions represent our exit from Greenville, SC and Jackson, MS, smaller markets where we lack scale and/or markets where we believe that growth is slowing.
 
2018 At-the-Market Offering
 During 2018, we issued 2,196,164 shares of common stock under our at-the-market offering program at an average price per share of $10.32, generating proceeds to us (net of approximately $0.5 million in commissions) of approximately $22.2 million. We used these proceeds to fund value add initiatives during 2018 and to reduce borrowings on our unsecured credit facility. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $115.2 million remained available for share issuances under our at-the-market program.
 
New Term Loan Agreement
 On October 30, 2018, we entered into a five-year, $200.0 million unsecured term loan agreement with KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”). The loan matures in January 2024 and bears interest at a spread over LIBOR, based on our overall leverage. At closing, the spread to LIBOR was 145 basis points. At closing, we drew $150.0 million under the loan. We drew the remaining $50.0 million in February 2019. We applied proceeds of both draws to reduce outstanding borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. In connection with our new term loan, we purchased an interest rate collar with an initial notional value of $100.0 million, increasing to $150.0 million, a 2.5%, cap a 2.25% floor, and a maturity date of January 17, 2024.
Financing Strategy
 
We use a combination of debt and equity sources to fund our business objectives. We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides us with the flexibility to manage our business and pursue our growth strategies, while allowing us to service our debt requirements and generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. We believe these objectives are best achieved by a capital structure that consists of common equity and prudent amounts of debt financing. However, we may raise capital in any form and under terms that we deem acceptable and in our best interests.  Our longer-term goal is to reduce our leverage ratio by growing the net operating income at our communities through rental increases, including those driven by value add initiatives, and prudent expense management. If our Board of Directors changes our policies regarding our use of leverage, we expect that it will consider many factors, including, our long-term strategic plan, the leverage ratios of publicly traded REITs with similar investment strategies, the cost of leverage as compared to expected operating net revenues and general market conditions. For further description of our indebtedness at December 31, 2018, see “Part II-Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 5: Indebtedness” below, or the financial statement indebtedness note. See also “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Associated with Debt Financing” below for more information about the risks related to operating on a leveraged basis.
Development and Structure of Our Company; Segment 
 
We were formed as a Maryland corporation on March 26, 2009. At such time, we were externally managed by our advisor, a subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust (“RAIT”), a publicly traded Maryland REIT whose common shares trade over-the-counter on the OTCQB under the symbol “RASF”.  We became internally managed as of December 20, 2016 when we acquired our advisor from RAIT and terminated the associated advisory agreement.  Upon internalization, we became responsible for managing our day-to-day business operations and our own portfolio of assets. 
 3



In connection with the management internalization, we acquired the multifamily property management business of RAIT on December 20, 2016 and we hired substantially all of the related employees.  We now operate that business in our wholly owned subsidiary, IRT Management, LLC (“IRT Management”), which was formed on October 26, 2016.  IRT Management is a full-service apartment property management company that, as of December 31, 2018, employed 451 staff and professionals and managed 15,880 apartment units, all of which are owned by us. IRT Management provides services to us in connection with the rental, leasing, operation and management of our properties. 
 
We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), structure in which all of our assets are held by, and substantially all of our operations are conducted through, our operating partnership, Independence Realty Operating Partnership, LP, which we refer to as IROP, and subsidiaries of IROP. IROP was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on March 27, 2009. We are the sole general partner of IROP and manage and control its business.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned a 99.0% interest in IROP. The remaining 1.0% consists of common units of limited partnership interest issued to third parties in exchange for contributions of properties to IROP.  We refer to these transactions as UPREIT transactions. Limited partners have certain limited approval and voting rights and their common units are exchangeable, in defined circumstances, for the equivalent number of shares of common stock or, at our option, the equivalent value in cash.
 
Substantially all of our assets are comprised of multifamily real estate assets generally leased to tenants on a one-year basis. Therefore, we aggregate our real estate assets for reporting purposes and operate in one reportable segment, see “Part II-Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 12: Segment Reporting” below. 
 
Competition 
 
In attracting and retaining residents to occupy our properties, we compete with numerous other housing alternatives. Our properties compete directly with other rental apartments as well as condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent or purchase in the sub-markets in which our properties are located. Principal factors of competition include rent or price charged, attractiveness of the location and property, and quality and breadth of services and amenities. If our competitors offer leases at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants. 
 
The number of competitive properties relative to demand in a particular area has a material effect on our ability to lease apartment units at our properties and on the rents we charge. In certain sub-markets there exists an oversupply of single family homes and condominiums and a reduction of households, both of which affect the pricing and occupancy of our rental apartments. Additionally, we compete with other real estate investors, including other apartment REITs, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies in acquiring, redeveloping and managing apartment properties. This competition affects our ability to acquire properties and the price that we pay for such acquisitions. 
 
Employees 
 
As of February 13, 2019, we had 455 employees and believe our relationships with our employees to be good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Regulation 
 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity, and fair housing laws. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Environmental Matters
 
As a part of our standard due diligence process for acquisitions, we generally obtain environmental studies of the sites from outside environmental engineering firms. The purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the site and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. These studies generally include historical reviews of the site, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of the site and surrounding properties, inspection for the presence of asbestos, poly-chlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”), and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports. Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, may be performed to investigate potential sources of contamination. The environmental studies we received on properties that we have acquired have not revealed any material environmental liabilities. Should any potential environmental risks or conditions be discovered during our due diligence 
 4


process, the potential costs of remediation will be assessed carefully and factored into the cost of acquisition, assuming the identified risks and factors are deemed to be manageable and within reason. We are not aware of any existing conditions that we believe would be considered a material environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental risks or that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.

Trade Street Residential Merger
 
On September 17, 2015, we acquired Trade Street Residential, Inc (“TSRE”), through a merger transaction. Through this transaction we added 19 properties to our then existing portfolio. The consolidated net assets and results of operations of TSRE have been included in our consolidated financial statements from and after the closing date of the transaction. As of January 1, 2017, the operating results of the TSRE assets were included in our same store operating results. 
Qualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust
 
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2011. We recorded no income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.
 
To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gains) to our stockholders annually. If we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our stockholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and our property.  Our 2018 distributions to our stockholders exceeded our REIT taxable income. We believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to continue to qualify and maintain treatment as a REIT and we intend to operate in such a manner so that we will remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.   For a discussion of the tax implications of our REIT status to us and our stockholders, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
