History 
 
The Company was originally founded in 1999 as Spectrum Ventures LLC, a private company, registered in Tacoma, WA, for the purpose of developing, marketing and selling voice over IP products and services. In 2002, the Company changed its name to Nxtech Wireless Cable Systems, Inc. In August 2007, the Company changed its name to Oriens Travel & Hotel Management Corp. In November 2014, the Company changed its name to Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. During 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company deemed it in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to switch directions and become involved in the business of numismatics, specifically the collection and ultimately the sale of coins, paper currency, bullion and medals. On November 21, 2016 the Company (formerly known as Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. a Nevada corporation) entered into an agreement with Meso Numismatics, Corp., a Florida corporation. The respective Boards of Directors of the Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. and Meso Numismatics, Corp., at that time, determined that it was advisable and to the advantage of and the best interests of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. and its shareholders and Meso Numismatics, Corp. and its stockholders that Meso Numismatics, Corp. merge with and into Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. (the “Merger”). It was at that time, Mr. Melvin Pereira, our current Chief Executive Officer, who controlled both Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. and Meso Numismatics, Corp. that the Company acquired common control of Meso Numismatics, Corp. and the assets there held. At the completion of the Merger, Meso Numismatics Corp. ceased to exist. In September of 2018 the Company effected a name change and changed its name from Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. to Meso Numismatics, Inc.
 
Led by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, an avid numismatist, the goal of the Company is to generate continuous, scalable and growing revenues from the sale of its coins, paper currency, bullion and medals, while also teaching those interested in learning about numismatics. The Company intends to produce numismatic whitepapers in addition to holding seminars throughout the region. Within the U.S. operations, the Company regularly visits coin shows and other dealers throughout the country, providing information about the Meso region. The Company regularly acquires new customers through this approach, by bringing inventory that certain dealers do not have regular access to. The Company regularly engages in transactions with other numismatic dealers and brings U.S. numismatic goods back to the Meso region for sale, while simultaneously making sales in the U.S. This ‘Ox Cart Phenomenon’, which is essentially the efficient use of a transport and distribution vehicle, helps the Company keep its first-mover, on-the-ground advantage within the industry. Items are sent from Costa Rica to the U.S. and merchandise is simultaneously sent from the U.S. to Costa Rica, creating multiple sales streams.

Overview
 
Meso Numismatics, Inc., has established a growing numismatics operation Meso Numismatics focuses on the Central American Caribbean region with a concentration of products surrounding Mesoamerica (Mexico to Panama).
 
Having locations in Costa Rica and Florida for the purposes of conveniently shipping products, the Company has the ability to export its inventory of coins, paper currency, bullion and medals from Costa Rica, to be sold in the U.S. and around the world. Likewise, the Company also imports such products back to Costa Rica, to be sold throughout the local markets.

The Company adheres to strict processes related to acquisition and sale of its products. It begins by selecting the best inventory, be it a rare coin from Latin America, or a banknote with an error from the United States. All inventory is carefully screened by management, then sent to be graded by the proper grading authority. For all coins, medals and bullion, the Company’s inventory is sent to the Numismatic Guaranty Company for authentication and grading. For all banknotes, the Company utilizes the services of Paper Money Guaranty, LLC for authentication and grading, both Florida-based companies. Once graded, the inventory is sent to the Company’s Florida-based location prior to being sent to one of the Company’s many customers around the world.
 
We maintain an online store with eBay (www.mesocoins.com) and participate in live auctions with major companies such as Heritage Auctions, Stacks Bowers Auctions, Lyn Knight Auctions and Sedwick Coins for the sale of its coins, paper currency, bullion and medals. The Company also launched a new application technology available on the Google Play Store, as well as the Apple App Store. The Application is a banknote scanner which instantly identifies key characteristics of a banknote. This includes the catalog reference number of the note, the value, which entity it was issued by, the country of origin and the printer that printed the note. A picture of each note from our database of more than 61,000 banknotes from a combined 750 countries and regions will also be included with the information. For the numismatic industry in particular, this application eliminates the need for reference books, as well as the hours of time it takes to reference all the information about banknotes. With a simple snap of a picture, information is provided to the end-user almost instantaneously.
 
Meso expects to continue to acquire rare inventory at market rates, from throughout the Meso Region (including Central America and the Caribbean). The inventory is then sent for authentication and grading, followed by said items being sold throughout Meso’s sales outlets. This includes an eBay store with up to, but not limited to, $50,000 in items for sale at any one time. For some of the Company’s rarer inventory, items are sent to major auction houses around the world for sale.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company is working on an inventory tracking system by serial number. Until such time the inventory costs can not be properly confirmed, therefore any inventory balances are expensed during each reporting period.
 
License Agreements
 
Coins / Medals
 
The Company’s inventory is comprised of roughly 50% coins / medals and 50% paper money. The Company has a meticulous process for the acquisition and sales process for each coin item. The Company specializes in coins from the Meso region, but also acquires coins and medals from elsewhere around the world.
 
The process starts by visiting local shops and establishments throughout the Meso region to gather information about the coins that Company’s management is considering for acquisition. Once an item has been selected, it is paid for, then packaged and sent from Meso’s Costa Rica location to the Company’s Florida location. From there, the merchandise is once again examined, then sent to NGC (the Numismatic Guaranty Company) for grading and authentication. After approximately three weeks, the items are sent back to Meso’s Florida location for storage, safekeeping and subsequent distribution to its respective destinations.
 
Management carefully evaluates the grades assigned to each piece of merchandise and then decides which items will be sold through its eBay store, which items will be sold at live auction and which items will be traded for other items. Some pieces are also sent back to Costa Rica for trading, some are sold on eBay and some go to auction powerhouses around the globe.
 
Meso also acquires ungraded coins / medals from eBay, as well as at specialty shops throughout the Meso region and during certain U.S. shows. Those items are taken through the same aforementioned process.
 
Paper Money
 
As indicated above, paper money makes up approximately 50% of Meso’s inventory. The process of acquiring paper money almost mirrors that of coins / medals.
 
Meso’s management often visits local banks and central banks throughout the Meso region. Management selects banknotes within bundles, aiming to acquire rare and exceptional notes. This includes RADARS (the same serial number back-and-forth), errors and uncirculated rarities.

The note is then sent from Costa Rica to Florida for grading and authentication. For this service, the Company utilizes the Paper Money Guaranty, which is expected to examine the note in great detail, then offers a grade for its condition. The note is encased, then sent back to Meso’s Florida location for distribution to its final destination. Similarly to coins, management inspects each note, then decides whether it will be sold on eBay, at a specialty auction, or traded for other merchandise in the Meso Region.
 
Similar to coins, Meso also purchases ungraded notes on eBay or at other stores, has them graded through the same process, then decides where to sell it at the end.

Industry Overview
 
Numismatics itself is the study or collecting of currency, including but not limited to paper money, coins, medals, tokens and other objects. Numismatics is often associated with stamp collecting, philately, and is equally as popular when it comes to hobbies around the world.
 
The numismatic industry is a multi-billion-dollar market that continues to grow year-over-year. Estimates provided by PNG (The Professional Numismatists Guild) placed the U.S. rare coin market at between $3.4 and $4 billion in 2018.
 
At the forefront of the numismatic industry is NGC (The Numismatics Guaranty Company) and PMG (The Paper Money Guaranty). These two organizations, with locations around the world, are responsible for the majority of authenticating and grading various forms of currency. Since its inception in 1987, NGC has graded more than 42 million coins, with 61% representing the US, 16% representing Asia, $13% representing Europe, and, a combined 8% representing Africa, South America and Australia.
 
Growth Strategy
 
According to an article published in a May 2017 edition of The Economist, the global numismatic market has a value between $5 Billion and $8 Billion per year. It has been noted that out of all the global numismatic sales around the world, the United States is responsible for roughly 85% of the market, further depicted in the chart below. We believe we can capture market share in the U.S. market and we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of, As indicated by the following chart, the Company has the opportunity for growth within the U.S. and the Latin American region as well. The Company has the opportunity for growth within the Latin American region as well. The Company also expects to perform outreach and educate Latin America and Australia about the value of numismatics.

Many Latin American countries postal services are difficult to navigate due to political unrest and corruption. We believe we have an advantage by having boots on the ground in Costa Rica, and associates throughout all of Latin America, which affords us the opportunity to procure almost any type of item and safely have it graded and then sold.
 
Successful importation and exportation of merchandise between Central America and the United States is crucial for the Company. Being able to acquire inventory at reduced costs, then selling the items for healthy profits, once graded, continues to be the key to growth.
 
The Company anticipates organic growth as well growth through acquisitions, as the right opportunities present themselves. The Company has and will continue to reinvest capital in new inventory, further supporting its long-term goal of becoming a recognized, global numismatic brand. Possible future acquisitions include websites / social media pages, in addition to physical numismatic businesses that could become available. These acquisitions could be solely of a company’s inventory, or their physical location and assets as well.
 
Further, the Company anticipates monetization of its mobile application in 2019. This could be through the use of third-party advertisements, or charging for the application to future users. Management is still working to define the best course of action for maximum monetization of its mobile application.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Technology
 
To our knowledge, Meso Numismatics has the only banknote scanner on the market. The technology, mostly utilized by numismatists, quickly assesses all the information about a banknote and almost instantly displays the information, along with a replica banknote from the database.
 
The Meso App, available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store, is expected to eventually be transitioned into a platform to buy, sell, and trade banknotes. Monetization is expected come from advertisers displaying banner ads, as well as transactional fees from the sales of items. The Company also has the ability, although it does not do so yet, to charge the user for general use of the App.
 
Location
 
Meso Numismatics has office locations in San Jose, Costa Rica and Boca Raton, Florida. Having dual locations, especially in these two areas in particular, is extremely advantageous to the Company.
 
The Costa Rican location of Meso is pivotal for the Company. Management in this location is able to obtain some items, below-market prices due to relationships made within the industry. While a US collector must pay for an item (usually with a premium) plus shipping and handling, having management on the ground allows the Company to acquire items without the extra costs. Management also has relationships with dealers throughout the region and trades / exchanges merchandise for better items. The majority of the Company’s inventory originates in Costa Rica, then is shipped to Florida for grading and authentication.
 
The Boca Raton location of Meso is almost as pivotal as the Costa Rican location, as the leading grader and authenticator of merchandise (PMG and NGC) also has locations in Florida. Merchandise is sent from Costa Rica to Boca Raton. Once inventoried, merchandise is sent to PMG or NGC for grading and authenticating. Once complete, the inventory is returned to the Boca Raton location where it is safely housed and distributed to its final location. Having this location allows the Company to ship items globally at significantly lower rates than shipping from Costa Rica.
 
Management
 
The Management of Meso Numismatics has over 40 years of experience in numismatics. Due to Mr. Pereira’s knowledge of the industry, NGC and PMG have allowed Meso Numismatics to become an authorized dealer of their companies. In addition, under the direction of Mr. Pereira, Meso Numismatics won the coveted 2018 PMG Registry Award for the Best Presented Set, displaying the Company’s nearly flawless collection of Costa Rican Banknotes from 1950 to present. Mr. Pereira continues to be a resource for U.S. collectors who are seeking Latin American inventory.
 
Prior to his career in numismatics, Mr. Pereira owned a technology consulting company, after attending a social media program from MIT. Mr. Pereira was responsible for the infrastructure, the IT, and internet engineering for several of his client companies.

Management also has close relationships with the grading agencies, as a Registered Dealer with PMG and NGC. The Company is able to submit inventory on the behalf of others; and receives discounts as a Registered Dealer.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
Meso has strategically partnered with Softon Digital (“Softon”) of Costa Rica, in addition to the above relationships with PMG and NGC. Softon assisted in the development and creation of the Meso App and it is expected that Softon will continue to help the Company evolve the technological portion of the business, with their team of programmers and engineers.
Competition 
 
In the coins and other collectibles business, we will compete with a number of comparably sized and smaller firms, as well as a number of larger firms throughout the United States. Our primary competitors are American Numismatic Rarities, a comparably-sized coin auctioneer. Many of our competitors have the ability to attract customers as a result of their reputation and the quality collectibles they obtain through their industry connections. Additionally, other reputable companies that sell rare coins and other collectibles may decide to enter our markets to compete with us. These companies have greater name recognition and have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. If these auction companies are successful in entering the specialized market for premium collectibles in which we participate or if dealers and sellers participate less in our auctions, we may attract fewer buyers and our revenue could decrease.
Employees
 
As of April 16, 2019, the Company had 1full-time employee our Chief Executive Officer, Melvin Pereira.
