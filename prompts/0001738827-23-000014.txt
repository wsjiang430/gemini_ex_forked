ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Transition Period
On September 3, 2021, our Board of Directors ("Board" or "Board of Directors") approved a change in our fiscal year end from January 31 to December 31, effective beginning with the eleven-month period ended December 31, 2021. In this Annual Report, references to “Transition Period” refer to the eleven-month period ended December 31, 2021.
Company Overview
Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, “KLX Energy Services,” “KLXE,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
KLX Energy Services is a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in both conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. KLXE was initially formed from the combination and integration of seven private oilfield service companies acquired during 2013 and 2014. Each of the acquired businesses was regional in nature and brought one or two specific service capabilities to KLX Energy Services. We were incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2018, and on September 14, 2018, we completed our spin-off from KLX Inc. and became an independent, publicly traded company. See Item 7. "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more details of our acquisitions since becoming a publicly traded company, including our 2020 acquisition of QES.
We deliver mission critical oilfield services to primarily independent major oil and gas companies focused on drilling, completion, production and intervention activities for technically demanding wells from over 50 service facilities located in the United States. Our primary services include directional drilling, coiled tubing, thru tubing, hydraulic frac rentals, fishing, pressure control, wireline, rig-assisted snubbing, fluid pumping, flowback, testing, pressure pumping and well control services. Our primary rentals and products include hydraulic fracturing stacks, blow out preventers, tubulars, downhole tools, dissolvable plugs, composite plugs and accommodation units. We operate in three segments on a geographic basis, including the Southwest Region (the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford), the Rocky Mountains Region (the Bakken, Williston, DJ, Uinta, Powder River, Piceance and Niobrara basins) and the Northeast/Mid-Con Region (the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Mid-Continent STACK and SCOOP and Haynesville). 
Our proprietary products and specialized services are supported by technically skilled personnel and a broad portfolio of innovative in-house research and development (“R&D”), manufacturing, repair and maintenance capabilities. We work with our customers to provide engineered solutions across the entire lifecycle of the well, by streamlining operations, reducing non-productive time and developing cost-effective solutions and customized tools for our customers’ most challenging service needs, which include technically complex unconventional wells requiring extended reach horizontal laterals with greater completion intensity per well. We believe long-term revenue growth opportunities will continue to be driven by increases in the number of new customers served and the breadth of services we offer to existing and prospective customers. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more details about our complementary suite of our targeted services and engineered solutions.
We endeavor to create a “next generation” oilfield services company in terms of management controls, processes and operating metrics and have driven these processes down through the operating management structure in every region. We believe this differentiates us from many of our competitors. This allows us to offer our customers in all of our geographic regions discrete, comprehensive and differentiated services that leverage both the technical expertise of our skilled engineers and our in-house R&D team. 
Industry Overview
The oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels are driven primarily by drilling rig counts, technological advances, well completions, workover activity, the geological characteristics of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels and our customers’ capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local weather, transportation and consumption patterns. Global supply and demand factors will likely continue to result in commodity price volatility, similar to that experienced in 2022.
In 2021, economic activity started recovering from COVID-19, albeit at an uneven pace. This led to an increase in activity for the industry, as evidenced by a higher rig count and West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") prices through the end of our fiscal year. The industry has seen a significant rebound since the emergence of the pandemic, including in early 2022, as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and increasing demand for oil and gas. For more information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Trends and Outlook” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
Products and Services
The principal high value-added services and related tools and equipment we offer to support our customers throughout the lifecycle of the well include drilling, completions, production and well intervention services and products in each of our geographic reporting segments.
Drilling: We provide directional drilling and associated drilling support services, including accommodations packages, to exploration and production ("E&P") companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas developments in the United States, including all active U.S. oil and natural gas basins with level 1 facilities in Appalachian Mountain, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, West Texas and Rocky Mountain regions.
Our drilling activities are comprised of directional drilling services, downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning, site supervision, accommodation rentals and other drilling rentals, which assist customers in the drilling and placement of complex directional and horizontal wellbores. These directional drilling activities utilize in-house positive pulse and electromagnetic measurement-while-drilling communication options to ensure accurate and timely delivery of data transmission for all real-time drilling applications as well as logging-while-drilling capabilities.
In addition to navigation, our systems offer various technologies, including gamma ray, azimuthal gamma ray, real-time continuous inclination and azimuth, rotary steerable, pressure-while-drilling, mode shifting, stick-slip and destructive dynamics, dynamic sequencing and real-time shock and vibration modules. KLXE utilizes modern well planning and anti-collision software to assist our well planners in providing accurate real-time information to our customers. Additionally, KLXE offers our K-series mud motor fleet that features a proprietary transmission-mandrel to deliver strong build rates, fights fatigue on extended laterals and is available to service all known well profiles. The demand for these services tend to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. 
As of December 31, 2022, our market share of the U.S. onshore drilling market was 7.4%, as compared to 8.4% as of December 31, 2021, as measured by the number of rigs we have worked on during the year as a proportion of the total number of rigs published by Baker Hughes. We intend to continue to re-deploy additional directional drilling capacity into 2023, as market conditions warrant.
Completion: Our completions activities are focused on services that help our customers complete and stimulate extended reach horizontal laterals and more technical wellbores. We are highly experienced in safely servicing deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells in all of the most active onshore basins in the 
United States and provide premium perforating services for both wireline and tubing-conveyed applications. We believe we offer best-in-class service execution at the wellsite and innovative downhole technologies, positioning us to benefit from our ability to service technically complex wells where the potential for increased operating leverage is high due to the large number of stages per well. This is in addition to our customer-centered focus on execution rather than price. 
Our completions activities include a wide range of services: 

•coiled tubing and nitrogen services;
•wireline services (including pump down perforating, logging and pipe recovery);
•pressure control products and services;
•wellhead and hydraulic fracturing rental products and services;
•flowback and testing services;
•thru-tubing technologies and services;
•rig assist snubbing services;
•cementing products and services;
•acidizing and pressure pumping services; and
•downhole completion tools, including:
◦toe sleeves;
◦wet shoe cementing bypass subs;
◦composite plugs;
◦dissolvable plugs;
◦liner hangers;
◦stage cementing tools, inflatables, float and casing equipment; and 
◦retrievable completion tools.
Our coiled tubing units are used in the provision of completion services or in support of well-servicing and workover applications. Our rig-assisted snubbing units are used in conjunction with a workover rig to insert or remove downhole tools or in support of other well services while maintaining pressure in the well, or in support of unconventional completions. Our nitrogen pumping units provide a non-combustible environment downhole and are used in support of other pressure control or well-servicing applications. We also offer highly-technical and specialized well control services, which are typically required in response to emergencies at the well site, requiring a variety of solutions including freezing, hot tapping and gate valve drilling services, as well as critical well control and containment operations. Our team is comprised of oilfield services veterans with extensive domestic and international experience in well control operations. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a fleet of 39 coiled tubing units, 23 of which are large diameter coiled tubing units, across our geographical regions. Over time, when the industry recovers, we anticipate that our investments in large diameter coil tubing spreads will allow us to increase our share of spend as the large diameter coil tubing pulls through asset light services such as flowback and testing services, thru-tubing and pressure control services, while leveraging our enhanced cost structure. 
Last year we continued to optimize the quality and performance of our magnesium alloy based line of dissolvable hydraulic fracturing plugs. Our proprietary dissolvable plugs deliver all the benefits of a traditional hydraulic fracturing plug but without the need for bottom hole intervention for removal. KLXE dissolvable plugs have been deployed successfully across all major U.S. oil and natural gas basins in now more than 910 wells by more than 60 customers. Our plugs dissolve quickly and reliably, resulting in faster time to production, are effective in a wide range of operating temperatures and salinity, including temperatures ranging from 80 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and do not require mill out, thus saving time and cost. 
The Company has 77 wireline units in the fleet and 37, or 48%, are configured to run pump down or plug-and-perf operations. Our R&D organization also enables our operations to support our customers with cutting edge pump down operations that include greaseless wireline, addressable gun systems and addressable release tools, to provide our customers with high quality pump down services. We also maintain a full line of radial cement bond tools, compensated neutron porosity tools and casing evaluation tools to provide well 
evaluation services to our clients. We also utilize greaseless line and quiet truck wireline technology to meet the environmental concerns of our customers. 
We offer a full line of valves and corresponding services to assist clients with their pressure control needs during hydraulic fracturing operations. These valves are assembled in predetermined configurations based on customer preference and installed on the wellhead to control flow and pressure during hydraulic fracturing operations. We own a large, young line of valves serving the North American onshore oil and gas market. We have enhanced our hydraulic fracturing valve fleet line through the internal development of next generation technology, including our proprietary, patent pending hydraulic fracturing relief valve (“FRV”). Introduced in 2016, the FRV was built and designed to replace older “pop-off” systems. When tied into a hydraulic fracturing core (pumps), the FRV gives customers a safer and more reliable method for relieving surface pressure in the event of an unforeseen overpressure event. By doing this, we believe we minimize operational risk, as well as greatly reduce health, safety and environmental concerns that are associated with hydraulic fracturing operations. 
Additional technologies that we currently deploy on behalf of our customers include our (i) patented flotation collar, which assists customers in getting completion casing to the bottom of extended reach wells when friction prevents getting casing to depth, (ii) proprietary internal pressure actuated ("IPA") toe sleeve, which allows customers a consistent and reliable hydraulic fracturing initiation sleeve at the toe of the completion, (iii) composite hydraulic fracturing plug, a flow control device that is set in the wellbore at given intervals to divert fluid into the formation, and (iv) dissolvable plugs. 
Production: We also provide services to enhance and maintain oil and gas production throughout the productive lives of our customers’ wells. Our production services include maintenance-related intervention services as well as the provision of specifically required products and equipment. As with our completion and intervention service offerings, we have developed a portfolio of proprietary tools that we believe differentiates our production solutions service offering. The principal services and equipment we provide across the production lifecycle of the well include (i) production blow out preventers, (ii) mechanical wireline services, (iii) slick line services, (iv) hydro-testing, (v) premium tubulars and (vi) other specialized production tools.
We believe our proprietary production tool portfolio creates a distinct competitive advantage for us in selling our production services. Key downhole production tools that we have developed and deployed with strong customer adoption include: 
Punch Ram Tool—The punch ram tool gives customers the ability to safely and repeatedly release trapped pressure inside production tubulars during pulling operations. The alternative is to “hot-tap” the tubing, which is a high-risk operation that most operators are not willing to employ. 
Hydraulic Fracturing Protect Rod Hang Off Tool—This tool is developed to give customers the ability to “hang off” a rod string rather than tripping it out of the hole and laying it down. The associated costs of tripping rods out of the hole coupled with the damage of laying them down and picking the string back, we believe, make this tool an excellent alternative option for customers. The hang off tool allows an operator to easily hang the rod string in the wellhead and still gives them the ability to tie into the tubing, if need be, to monitor pressure or pump fluid. 
Intervention: Our intervention services consist of best-in-class technicians and equipment that are focused on providing customers engineered solutions to downhole complications. Intervention involves the application of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment and remove other obstructions that either interfere with the completion of the well or are causing diminished production. The principal services we provide to remediate these complications include fishing, thru-tubing and pipe recovery. Given the unique geology and operating characteristics of each well, no two complications are the same, yet each complication our customers experience results in substantial disruption to their well operation and economics. As a result, resolution is “mission critical” to our customers and superior outcomes can support premium pricing. Those outcomes rely principally on the skill and experience of the technicians dedicated to resolving the issues and the availability of exactly the right tools for every eventuality. We believe we have one of the leading teams of 
intervention specialists in the industry, supported by a comprehensive portfolio of intervention tools and equipment. Each of our geographic regions is fully staffed with top technicians and fully equipped with a comprehensive range and quantity of equipment given the wellbore profiles for the region. 
We support our intervention group with a portfolio of tools consisting of patented and other proprietary technologies. Recent innovations currently deployed in the field include our: (i) DXD Venturi Tool; (ii) HAVOK PDC Bearing Section; (iii) Hydraulic By-Pass Tool; and (iv) Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve). These tools were designed to improve upon conventional technology used by our competitors. 
DXD Venturi Tool—The patent pending DXD (Debris Extraction Device) is an internally developed downhole tool that assists customers in removing unwanted debris from the wellbore. Utilizing fluid dynamics, the tool consists of a jet section that accelerates fluid across a nozzle. This increase in fluid velocity creates a pressure drop inside the tool, which draws fluid through an inlet. As the fluid is drawn into the system through the inlet, it picks up unwanted debris in the fluid flow, which is then caught in a series of chambers installed below the tool. The chambers then carry the debris out of the hole when the system is brought back to surface. 
HAVOK PDC Bearing Section—The patented Havok bearing pack is an extremely reliable and robust thru-tubing motor that deploys the industry’s only all PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) bearing design - meaning no ball bearings. The elegant design greatly reduces the operating cost of our thru-tubing motors and provides us with a significant differentiator in the thru-tubing space. Since being deployed, Havok has proven to be one of the most robust bearing packs available on the market. 
Hydraulic By-Pass Tool—The patented hydraulic by-pass tool allows us to run our conventional motor assemblies and achieve substantially higher circulation rates without reducing the expected life of our conventional power section. The additional fluid being pumped and by-passed optimizes the downhole hydraulics for the operation and assists with proper debris removal. 
Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve)—The patented Drill Mate is a downhole tool that was developed to give customers a way to mechanically by-pass fluid during drill out or clean out operations. The tool is a two-piece system that opens and closes based upon the amount of weight being set on the mill or bit. During bottom milling with the tool, the tool is in the closed position, putting 100% of the flow through the motor bottomhole assembly ("BHA"). As weight is removed from the mill or bit either by milling through the obstruction or picking up off bottom, the tool strokes open, thereby exposing by-pass ports that divert fluid through them. At this point, a customer can increase the amount of fluid being pumped through the BHA to assist in debris removal. This increase in fluid rate does not affect the life of the motor as the additional fluid is by-passed through the Drill Mate tool. 
Customers and Marketing 
Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our sales are to major, large independent and regional oil and natural gas companies, and these sales have resulted in a diversified and geographically balanced portfolio of more than 740 customers within North America. Revenues from our five largest customers collectively represented approximately 21% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of our revenues during the year.
Our sales activities are conducted through a network of sales representatives and business development personnel, which provide coverage on a product-line and geographical basis. Sales representatives work closely with local operations managers to target potential opportunities through strategic focus and planning. Customers are identified as targets based on their drilling and completion activity, geographic location and economic viability. Direction of the sales team is conducted through weekly meetings and daily communication. Our marketing activities are performed internally. Our strategy is based on building a strong North American brand though multiple media outlets including our website, select social media accounts, print, billboard advertisements, press releases and various industry-specific conferences, publications and lectures. We have a technical sales organization with expertise and focus within their specific service line. Our strategy is to sell our services using data to demonstrate safety and service quality. We accomplish this 
through communication across sales regions and operations departments to share best practices and leverage existing customer relationships. 
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete on a number of factors including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and a growing breadth of services and products. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. To be successful, a company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies and drilling, completions, production and intervention service contractors at competitive prices. We provide our services across the United States and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies.
Our major competitors include Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, RPC, Nine Energy Services, Phoenix Technology Services, Scientific Drilling International, NexTier, Liberty Oilfield Services, Ranger Energy Services, ProPetro Holding Corp., STEP Energy Services, and other private competitors.
We differentiate our company from our competitors by delivering a broad range of drilling, completion, production and intervention services safely with high quality equipment and highly competent personnel, which we believe enables us to deliver superior execution while operating an efficient and safe working environment. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services based on the local leadership, relationships and expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services. We maintain and develop new business through corporate, regional, safety, quality and discrete product/service specialist sales teams throughout the United States. 
We believe our focus on cultivating our existing customer relationships as well as developing new relationships, while maintaining our high standard of customer service, technology, safety, performance and quality of crews, equipped us to effectively compete and succeed in a competitive market.
Suppliers and Procurement 
We purchase a wide variety of materials, components and partially completed and finished products from manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies, materials or equipment and, as of December 31, 2022, no single supplier accounted for more than 4% of our total supply and procurement costs. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Customer Service 
We are highly differentiated in each of the geographic markets that we serve with our services and associated product offerings. This is achieved by providing targeted, complementary services and related products and being responsive to our customers with both quality, as measured by the industry-standard non-productive time, and timely responses to requests. The key elements include: 
•24-hours a day, seven days a week operations;
•recognized industry leading technicians in our principal service and product lines;
•responsiveness to our customers’ requirements for ready-to-deploy American Petroleum Institute certified equipment and a “can do” philosophy;
•technical interface with customers via product line management personnel; and
•client relationship building.
Technology and Intellectual Property
Our engineering and technology efforts are focused on providing efficient and cost-effective solutions to maximize production for our customers across major North American onshore basins. We have dedicated resources focused on the internal development of new technology and equipment, as well as resources focused on sourcing and commercializing new technologies through strategic relationships. Our sales and earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully introduce new or improved products and services to the market.
Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent, license or strategic relationship as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities, customer service-oriented culture and application of our know-how to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, rather than our right to exclude others through patents or exclusive licenses. We also consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skill of our personnel to be more important than our registered intellectual property in our ability to compete. 
We believe we have become a “go-to” service provider for piloting certain new technologies across North America because of our service quality, execution at the wellsite and scale. These strategic relationships provide us and our customers with access to unique technology from independent innovators. This also allows us to minimize exposure to potential technology adoption risks and the significant costs associated with developing and implementing R&D internally. Our internal resources are focused on evolving our existing proprietary tools to stay on trend and ensure quicker, lower completion and production costs for our customers. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
The provision of technical services or use of certain of our tools and equipment in connection therewith could involve operational risk and thereby expose us to liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product, could result in personal injury, loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Damages from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a fire or explosion, could result in substantial claims for damages. We generally attempt to negotiate the terms of our Master Services Agreements ("MSAs") consistent with industry practice. In general, we attempt to take responsibility for our own personnel and property, while our customers, such as the E&P companies and well operators, take responsibility for their own personnel, property and all liabilities arising from well and subsurface operations. 
In addition, claims for loss of oil and gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we from time to time experience traffic accidents, which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 
Oilfield services companies, despite efforts to maintain high safety standards, from time to time, have suffered accidents. Our business is subject to the same risks and, as a result, there is a risk that we will experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, and our relationship with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. In particular, in recent years many of our large customers have placed an increased emphasis on the safety records of their service providers. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensatory payments, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
We maintain a risk management program that covers operating hazards, including products and completed operations, property damage and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental claims. Our risk management program includes primary, umbrella and excess umbrella liability policies in excess of $75.0 
million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution claims. We believe that our insurance is sufficient to cover property and casualty liability claims.
We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in our MSAs. We retain the risk for any liability not indemnified by our customers and in excess of our insurance coverage. These MSAs delineate our and our customers’ respective warranty and indemnification obligations with respect to the services we provide. We endeavor to negotiate MSAs with our customers that provide, among other things, that we and our customers assume (without regard to fault) liability for damages to our respective personnel and property. For catastrophic losses, we endeavor to negotiate MSAs that include industry-standard carve-outs from the knock-for-knock indemnities. Additionally, our MSAs often provide carve-outs to the “without regard to fault” concept that would permit, for example, us to be held responsible for events of catastrophic loss only if they arise as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our MSAs typically provide for industry-standard pollution indemnities, pursuant to which we assume liability for surface pollution associated with our equipment and originating above the surface (without regard to fault), and our customer assumes (without regard to fault) liability arising from all other pollution, including, without limitation, underground pollution and pollution emanating from the wellbore as a result of an explosion, fire or blowout. The summary of MSAs set forth above is a summary of the material terms of the typical MSA that we have in place and does not reflect every MSA that we have entered into or may enter into in the future, some of which may contain indemnity structures and risk allocations between our customers and us that are different than those described here. 
Information Technology
Our IT systems provide us with a scalable integrated platform that facilitates efficient operations, consolidated invoicing and optimal equipment utilization on both a site and segment basis. Our operating strategy is based upon balancing high asset and personnel utilization levels with consistently superior customer service. As such, our IT systems are integral to effectively managing our business. 
Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations and those of our customers are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water, protection of natural resources and certain wildlife and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements; and the imposition of injunctions or other orders to prohibit certain activities, restrict certain operations or force future compliance with environmental regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state statutes, governing remediation of contamination, which could occur or might have occurred at facilities that we own or operate, or which we formerly owned or operated, or to which we send or have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we could become subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability relating to our facilities or operations. 
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations, as amended from time to time, to which we or our customers are subject. 
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA and analogous state laws. RCRA currently exempts many E&P wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, efforts have been made from time to time to remove this exclusion and thus it is possible that certain E&P waste now classified as non-hazardous waste and excluded from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry. The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws. Standards have been developed for worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws. Stricter regulation of wastes generated during our or our customers’ operations could result in increased costs for our operations or the operations of our customers, which could in turn reduce demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 

CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA and any state analogs may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, and for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. The EPA has the power to make additional substances subject to CERCLA and is considering doing so at this time, which could result in additional remediation costs at certain properties in the future. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Under the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) has the ability to designate additional species as protected by the ESA and alter the areas designated as habitat for such species. For example, FWS recently published a rule listing two distinct population segments of the Lesser Prairie Chicken under the ESA, a species found in some states where we operate. FWS has also considered taking additional measures related to species such as the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard and Greater Sage Grouse, which can be found in some areas where we operate. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species, or other agency actions aimed at species conservation could indirectly cause us to incur additional costs, cause our or our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers' operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, result in 
new difficulties obtaining permits or other authorizations, and limit future development activity in affected areas, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers. 
Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (“MBTA”). FWS has taken differing positions on the extent to which there is criminal liability under the MBTA for certain actions reacted to migratory birds, their nests, or their eggs. Some of our customers may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered and threatened species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. 
National Environmental Policy Act
E&P activities on federal lands may be subject to review under the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. Approvals necessary for our customers to operate on federal or Tribal land are subject to NEPA. The NEPA review process has the potential to delay the permitting and subsequent development of oil and natural gas projects. NEPA requirements are subject to or influenced by regulations and guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”), and the CEQ’s requirements and guidance for such reviews have altered several times during the past few years under different administrations, and are likely to continue to change. Most recently, in January 2023 the CEQ issued new guidance on consideration of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and climate change in NEPA environmental reviews. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of such changes on our operations or the operations of our customers. To the extent that new and more stringent NEPA requirements are finalized in the future, they could create permitting delays for our customers requiring federal approvals and thereby negatively impact the demand for our services. 
Worker Health and Safety 
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of this information to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates and provides safety oversight of commercial motor vehicles, the EPA establishes requirements to protect human health and the environment, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF") establishes requirements for the safe use and storage of explosives, and the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission establishes requirements for the protection against ionizing radiation. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Additionally, OSHA has implemented rules establishing a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and other provisions to protect employees. These rules require compliance with engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica in connection with hydraulic fracturing activities. OSHA and analogous state agencies may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. Additionally, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with health risks, including the lung disease silicosis. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the hydraulic fracturing industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of hydraulic fracturing sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers' use of hydraulic fracturing sand.
Transportation Safety and Compliance 
Operating a fleet of over 1,700 vehicles, we are subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) and analogous state agencies, which requires us to comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and Hazardous Material Regulations for interstate travel, and comparable state regulations for intrastate travel. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, regulatory safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications, and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices (including for example, changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size) or by reducing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Additional regulatory initiatives may be pursued relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and GHG emissions, which could further increase our costs due to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, decreases in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and increases in operating expenses. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads and our increased truck traffic could contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. Moreover, substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. 
Water Discharges 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act” or "CWA") and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. 
There continues to be uncertainty on the federal government's applicable jurisdictional reach under the CWA over waters of the United States, including wetlands, as the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations have pursued multiple rulemakings since 2015 in an attempt to define the scope of such reach. While the EPA and Corps under the Trump Administration issued a final rule in January 2021 narrowing federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, the EPA and Corps under President Biden issued a new rule at the end of 2022 that again broadens federal jurisdiction over these waters. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on certain aspects of the definition in 2023, and the Biden Administration rule is likely to be subject to legal challenge. Therefore, the final substance of this definition and its impacts on the scope of the Clean Water Act remain uncertain at this time.
To the extent the Biden Administration rule goes into effect and expands the scope of the Clean Water Act's jurisdiction in areas where we or our customers conduct operations, such developments could delay, restrict or halt the development of projects, result in longer permitting timelines, or increased compliance expenditures or mitigation costs for our customers’ operations, which may reduce our customers’ rate of production of oil and gas and reduce the demand for our products and services.
In other CWA matters, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of 
facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. The CWA and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. 
Air Emissions 
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. These regulations change frequently. These laws and regulations may require us or our customers to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. For example in 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone and, on December 31, 2020, published notice of a final action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, this December 2020 final action is subject to legal challenge, which is currently on hold while the Biden Administration is reconsidering the December 2020 final action in favor of a potentially more stringent ground-level ozone NAAQS. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, which in turn could delay or impair our or our customers’ ability to obtain air emission permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive relief, for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 
Climate Change
The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and around the world. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions.
The U.S. Congress has not adopted comprehensive climate change legislation but did impose the first-ever fee on the emission of GHGs through a methane emissions charge. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) amends the CAA to impose a fee on the emission of methane from sources required to report their GHG emissions to the EPA, including those sources in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production and gathering and boosting source categories. The methane emissions charge would start in calendar year 2024 at $900 per ton of methane, increase to $1,200 in 2025, and be set at $1,500 for 2026 and each year after. Calculation of the fee is based on certain thresholds established in the IRA. The IRA also requires the EPA to revise GHG reporting requirements for segments of the oil and gas sector, including portions of our customer base, by August 2024. The methane emissions charge and reporting revisions could increase our customers' operating or compliance costs and adversely affect their businesses, thereby reducing demand for our products and services. The IRA also instructs the EPA to revise GHG reporting requirements that apply to some of our customers’ operations. While we cannot predict the impact of any such revisions, if these revisions result in additional compliance costs for our customers, they could negatively impact the demand for our services. 
Additionally, the IRA contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions. These incentives could accelerate the transition of the U.S. economy 
away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, reduce demand for our customers’ products, and thereby reduce demand for our services. 
In addition, President Biden has made combating climate change arising from GHG emissions a priority under this Administration and has issued, and may continue to issue, executive orders or other regulatory initiatives in pursuit of this regulatory agenda. At the federal level, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and impose new standards reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. 
In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions. In 2020, the Trump Administration revised performance standards for methane established in 2016 to lessen the impact of those standards and removed the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, the U.S. Congress subsequently passed, and President Biden signed into law, a revocation of the 2020 rulemaking, effectively reinstating the 2016 standards. In November 2021, the EPA issued a proposed rule and further supplemented the proposal in December 2022 to adopt new methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. If finalized, the proposed rule would establish Quad Ob new source and Quad Oc first-time existing source standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions in the oil and gas source category. This proposed rule would apply to upstream and midstream facilities at oil and natural gas well sites, natural gas gathering and boosting compressor stations, natural gas processing plants, and transmission and storage facilities. Owners or operators of affected emission units or processes would have to comply with specific standards of performance that may include leak detection using optical gas imaging and subsequent repair requirements, reduction of regulated emissions through capture and control systems, zero-emission requirements for certain equipment or processes, operations and maintenance requirements, and requirements for "green well" completions. Additionally, this proposed rule would impose expanded inspection, monitoring and emissions control requirements on oil and gas sites, as well as strengthen requirements related to emissions from equipment and routine flaring. The proposal would also establish a “Super Emitter Response Program” that would require operator response to emissions events exceeding 200 pounds per hour, as detected by regulatory authorities or qualified third parties. The proposal is expected to be finalized in 2023, but will likely be subject to legal challenges. As a result, we cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements, or the expected cost to comply with such requirements. Any increase in regulatory requirements may increase operating or compliance costs for our customers and thereby reduce the demand for our services. Some states where we operate, such as New Mexico and Colorado, have also imposed new or more stringent methane emission regulations, which could also increase operating or compliance costs for our customers in these states and impact demand for our services. Some states where we operate, such as New Mexico and Colorado, have also imposed new or more stringent methane emission regulations, which could also increase operating or compliance costs for our customers in these states and impact demand for our services.
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50 percent to 52 percent from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. Moreover, the international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference of the Parties ("COP26"), during which multiple announcements (not having the effect of law) were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-CO2 GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of a Global Methane Pledge, an initiative which over 100 counties joined, committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030, including "all feasible reductions" in the energy sector. These goals were reaffirmed at the 27th Conference of the Parties (“COP27”) in November 2022. The impacts of 
these orders, pledges, agreements and any legislation or regulation promulgated to fulfill the United States' commitments under the Paris Agreement, COP26, COP27 or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time. 
Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States. President Biden has issued several executive orders calling for more expansive action to address climate change and suspend new oil and gas operations on federal lands and waters. The suspension of the federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension. In November 2022 the federal Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) proposed a rule that would limit flaring from well sites on federal and Tribal lands, as well as allow the delay or denial of permits if BLM finds that an operator’s methane waste minimization plan is insufficient. Other actions adversely affecting the oil and gas industry that may be pursued by the Biden Administration include limiting hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters, limiting hydraulic fracturing by banning new oil and gas permitting on federal lands and waters, potentially eliminating certain tax rules (referred to as subsidies) that benefit the oil and gas industry, and imposing restrictions on pipeline infrastructure. 
Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court alleging, among other things, that such energy companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore, are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. 
Additionally, climate change policies may impact the Company or our customers’ access to capital. Certain shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies are concerned about the potential effects of climate change and may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending and investment practices that favor "clean" power sources, such as wind and solar, making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made "net zero" carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. At COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ("GFANZ") announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various sub-alliances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero emissions by 2050. These and other developments in the financial sector could lead to some lenders restricting access to capital for or divesting from certain industries or companies, including the oil and gas sector, or requiring that borrowers take additional steps to reduce their GHG emissions. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be pressured or required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. In late 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it had joined the Network for Greening the Financial System ("NGFS"), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. In November 2021, the Federal Reserve issued a statement in support of the efforts of the NGFS to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. While we cannot predict what policies may result from these announcements, a material reduction in the capital available to us or our fossil fuel-related customers could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could reduce the demand for our products and services. 
The SEC has also proposed a rule that would require registrants to make certain climate-related disclosures in registration statements and annual reports, including their governance of climate-related risks; material climate-related impacts on strategy, outlook and business model; climate risk management; Scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions and Scope 3 GHG emissions under certain circumstances; and if the registrant has set them, climate-related targets and goals. The final rule is expected in 2023 and may be subject to legal challenge. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege that an issuer's existing climate disclosures were misleading or deficient. We cannot predict the impact that any rule, if finalized, would have on our operations. To the extent that requirements or enforcement initiatives impose significant additional costs on us or our customers, we could be negatively impacted by the SEC’s regulatory or enforcement actions. 
Finally, increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. These climatic developments have the potential to cause physical damage to our and our customers’ assets or disrupt operations and thus could have an adverse effect on each of our operations. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or its production. While our consideration of changing climatic conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of our facilities and our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality.
Hydraulic Fracturing
Our businesses are dependent on our customers’ hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions.
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and regarding certain wastewater discharges from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities under the Safe Drinking Water Act. In late 2016, the EPA also released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. BLM under both the Obama and Trump Administrations has pursued rules governing hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. These requirements have been subject to legal challenge and the outcome remains uncertain.
The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered but refused to adopt federal legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing including considering amending the current exemption for hydraulic fracturing operations that do not include fracturing fluids that contain diesel fuel under the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Underground Injection Control program. The Biden Administration has issued executive orders, could issue additional executive orders, and could pursue other legislative and regulatory initiatives that restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. For example, President Biden issued an order in January 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases and authorizations, including drilling permits on federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days, and subsequently issued a second order on January 27, 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a study of current oil and gas practices. The suspension of these federal leasing activities prompted legal action by several states against the Biden Administration, resulting in issuance of a nationwide preliminary injunction by a federal district judge in Louisiana in June 2021, effectively halting implementation of the leasing suspension but the federal government is appealing the district court decision. These or similar federal actions, if taken in the future, could impose additional hydraulic fracturing limitations on our customers that could ultimately result in decreased demand for our products and services.
At the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where our customers operate. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. 
Seismic Events and Water Availability
In recent years, wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events, with research suggesting that the link between seismic events and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. The U.S. geological survey has in the recent past identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, which includes Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, Texas and Oklahoma have issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that impose certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. Texas and Oklahoma have also issued orders or other directives, from time to time, requesting or even compelling operators of certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal.
Finally, water is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our customers' access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third-party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies.
