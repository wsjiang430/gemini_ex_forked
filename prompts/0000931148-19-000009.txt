Business
Our company
GrafTech International Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of high quality graphite electrode products essential to the production of electric arc furnace (or EAF) steel and other ferrous and non‑ferrous metals. We believe that we have the most competitive portfolio of low‑cost graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in the industry, including three of the five highest capacity facilities in the world (excluding China). We are the only large scale graphite electrode producer that is substantially vertically integrated into petroleum needle coke, the primary raw material for graphite electrode manufacturing, which is currently in limited supply. This unique position provides us with competitive advantages in product quality and cost. Founded in 1886, we have over 130 years of experience in the research and development (or R&D) of graphite-and carbon‑based solutions, and our intellectual property portfolio is extensive. We currently have graphite electrode manufacturing facilities in Calais, France, Pamplona, Spain, Monterrey, Mexico and St. Marys, Pennsylvania. Our customers include major steel producers and other ferrous and non‑ferrous metal producers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (or EMEA), the Americas and Asia‑Pacific (or APAC), which sell their products into the automotive, construction, appliance, machinery, equipment and transportation industries. Our vision is to provide highly engineered graphite electrode services, solutions and products to EAF operators. Based on the high quality of our graphite electrodes, reliability of our petroleum needle coke supply and our excellent customer service, we believe that we are viewed as a preferred supplier to the global EAF steel producer market.
Graphite electrodes are an industrial consumable product used primarily in EAF steel production, one of the two primary methods of steel production and the steelmaking technology used by all “mini‑mills.” Electrodes act as conductors of electricity in the furnace, generating sufficient heat to melt scrap metal, iron ore or other raw materials used to produce steel or other metals. We estimate that, on average, the cost of graphite electrodes represents only approximately 1% to 5% of the total production cost of steel in a typical EAF, but they are essential to EAF steel production. Graphite electrodes are currently the only known commercially available products that have the high levels of electrical conductivity and the capability to sustain the high levels of heat generated in EAF steel production. As a result, EAF steel manufacturers have been willing to pay a premium for a reliable supply of high quality graphite electrodes, and, in some cases, to pass on this premium to their customers in the form of surcharges. Graphite electrodes are also used in steel refining in ladle furnaces and in other processes, such as the production of titanium dioxide, stainless steel, aluminum, silicon metals and other ferrous and non‑ferrous metals.
Petroleum needle coke, a crystalline form of carbon derived from decant oil, is the primary raw material used in the production of graphite electrodes. We achieved substantial vertical integration with this critical raw material source through our acquisition of Seadrift Coke LP (or Seadrift) in November 2010, significantly reducing our reliance on other suppliers. The petroleum needle coke industry is highly concentrated. We believe Seadrift is the second largest petroleum needle coke producer in the world. We also believe that the quality of Seadrift’s petroleum needle coke is superior for graphite electrode production compared to most of the petroleum needle coke available to our peers on the open market, allowing us to produce higher quality electrodes in a cost‑efficient manner. Additionally, we believe that this vertical integration provides a significant cost advantage relative to our competitors in periods of tight petroleum needle coke supply, such as the current market environment. We believe this cost advantage will grow as demand for petroleum needle coke increases for use in lithium‑ion batteries in electric vehicles. The demand for petroleum needle coke in lithium‑ion batteries is growing rapidly, with usage going from approximately 1,000 MT in 2014 to 60,000 MT in 2017. This rapidly growing alternative source of demand is a significant development for the petroleum needle coke industry and is contributing to the global shortage in petroleum needle coke.
According to the World Steel Association (or WSA), EAFs accounted for 46%, or 394 million metric tons (or MT), of global crude steel production (excluding China) in 2017, which represented an increase of 8% over 2016. Between 1984 and 2011, EAF steelmaking was the fastest‑growing segment of the steel sector, with production increasing at an average rate of 3.5% per year, based on WSA data. Historically, EAF steel production has grown faster than the overall steel market due to the greater resilience, more variable cost structure, lower capital intensity and more environmentally friendly nature of EAF steelmaking. This trend was partially reversed between 2011 and 2015 due to global steel production overcapacity driven largely by Chinese blast furnace (or BOF) steel production. Beginning in 2016, efforts by the Chinese government to restructure China’s domestic steel industry have led to limits on Chinese BOF steel production and lower export levels. In addition, developed economies, 
7


which typically have much larger EAF steel industries, have instituted a number of trade policies in support of domestic steel producers. As a result, since 2016, the EAF steel market has rebounded strongly and resumed its long‑term growth trajectory. This revival in EAF steel production has resulted in increased demand for our graphite electrodes.
At the same time, two supply‑side structural changes have contributed to record high prices of graphite electrodes in 2018. First, ongoing consolidation and rationalization of graphite electrode production capacity have limited the ability of graphite electrode producers to meet demand. We estimate that approximately 20% of graphite electrode industry production capacity (excluding China) was closed or repurposed from 2014-2016, and we believe the majority of these closures represent permanent reductions. Second, demand for petroleum needle coke has outpaced supply due to increasing demand for petroleum needle coke for lithium‑ion batteries used in electric vehicles. As a result, graphite electrode prices have reached record high prices in 2018. Historically, between 2008 and 2017, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes was approximately $4,500 per MT (on an inflation‑adjusted basis using constant 2018 dollars) and fell to a historic low of approximately $2,500 per MT in 2016. With the renewed demand for, and constrained supply of, graphite electrodes, industry spot prices have reached record highs in 2018. In light of improved market conditions, the long lead time required to produce our products, our position as one of the market’s largest producers and our ability, through our substantial vertical integration with Seadrift, to provide customers with a reliable long‑term supply of graphite electrodes despite the market shortage of petroleum needle coke, we have implemented a commercial strategy to sell graphite electrodes through three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts.
GrafTech historical weighted average realized prices and signed three‑ to five‑year weighted average contract prices for graphite electrodes

(1) | Weighted average realized price for a period reflects the total revenues from sales of graphite electrodes for the period divided by the graphite electrode sales volume for that period. The weighted average realized prices in this chart are shown in constant 2018 dollars for comparability. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operating Metrics.”


(2) | Weighted average contract price for a period reflects the volume‑weighted average price for graphite electrodes to be delivered under the three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts we have entered into in 2018 and 2019. All of these contracts have fixed prices and either fixed volumes (85% of the portfolio) or a specified volume range (15% of the portfolio). For those contracts with a specified volume range, weighted average contract prices are computed using the volume midpoint. The aggregate difference between the volume midpoint and the minimum or maximum volumes across our cumulative portfolio of take‑or‑pay contracts with specified volume ranges is approximately 5,000 MT per year in 2019‑2022. See “Business-Contracts and Customers.”

As a leading producer of graphite electrodes, we believe we are well‑positioned to benefit from this industry transformation. In 2017, based on our three primary operating facilities, we had the capability, depending on product demand and mix, to manufacture approximately 167,000 MT of graphite electrodes per year. In 2018, we completed an operational improvement and debottlenecking initiative to increase production capacity at these facilities by approximately 20% to approximately 202,000 MT. Currently, our warm idled St. Marys facility is finishing some electrodes sourced from other facilities to provide flexibility to our overall manufacturing footprint.  We could ramp up production at St. Marys if required to support our customers.  If restarted, St. Marys would add approximately 28,000 MT of annual capacity. This overall total production capacity would be comparable to our largest 
8


competitor, which we estimate currently has a total of approximately 230,000 MT of production capacity (excluding China). We believe the total worldwide graphite electrode production capacity was approximately 800,000 MT (excluding China) in 2018, with a capacity utilization of approximately 90% (excluding China). We believe worldwide graphite electrode production capacity, excluding China, has now increased to approximately 850,000 MT. Electrode production globally (excluding China) is focused on the manufacture of ultra‑high power (or UHP) electrodes for EAFs, while the majority of Chinese production is of ladle electrodes for BOFs. The production of UHP electrodes requires an extensive proprietary manufacturing process and material science knowledge, including the use of superior needle coke blends. As a result, graphite electrode producers inside and outside of China are generally not in direct competition with each other for major product lines.
On August 15, 2015, we became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (together with its affiliates "Brookfield") through a tender offer to shareholders and subsequent merger transaction. Brookfield is an experienced operator of industrial, natural resource and other tangible asset businesses. This transaction has provided us with a stable equity partner with experience in industrial sectors.
On April 23, 2018, we completed our initial public offering (or IPO) of 35,000,000 shares of our common stock held by Brookfield at a price of $15.00 per share. On April 26, 2018, we closed the sale of an additional 3,097,525 shares of common stock held by Brookfield at a price to the public of $15.00 per share, as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters in our IPO of their overallotment option. We did not receive any proceeds related to the IPO. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “EAF.”
On August 13, 2018, we repurchased 11,688,311 shares directly from Brookfield. These shares were retired upon repurchase. The price per share paid by us was equal to the price at which the underwriters purchased the shares from Brookfield’s August 2018 public secondary offering of 23,000,000 shares of our common stock, net of underwriting commissions and discounts. We funded the share repurchase from cash on hand. After giving effect to the offerings by Brookfield and our repurchase of shares, Brookfield owns approximately 79% of our common stock.

Competitive strengths
We are one of the two largest producers of graphite electrodes outside of China, accounting for approximately 24% of global production capacity (excluding China), and we believe our strategically positioned global footprint provides us with competitive advantages
We believe our facilities are among the most strategically located and lowest cost large‑scale graphite electrode manufacturing plants in the world. Of the graphite electrode manufacturing facilities currently operating outside of China, we estimate that our three operating manufacturing facilities represent approximately 24% of estimated production capacity for graphite electrodes, making us a critical supplier to global EAF steel manufacturers. Our manufacturing facilities are located in the Americas and EMEA, providing us with access to low‑cost and reliable energy sources, logistical and freight advantages in sourcing raw materials and shipping our graphite electrodes to our customers compared to our competitors, and excellent visibility into the large North American and European EAF steelmaking markets. Our experience in producing graphite electrodes for a varied global customer base positions us to meet customer requirements across a range of product types and quality levels, including support and technical services, further distinguishing us from our competitors.
We are a pure‑play provider of an essential consumable for EAF steel producers, the fastest‑growing sector of the steel industry
According to WSA, EAF steelmaking grew at an annual pace of approximately 14% in 2017, compared with 4% for steelmaking overall. As a result of the increasing global availability of steel scrap and the more resilient, high‑variable cost and environmentally friendly EAF model, we expect EAF producers to continue to grow at a faster rate than BOF producers globally. Additionally, EAF producers are increasingly able to utilize higher quality scrap and iron units, their two primary raw materials, to produce higher quality steel grades and capture market share from BOF producers, while maintaining a favorable cost structure. According to the WSA, in EMEA and the Americas, which together made up 93% of our 2018 net sales, EAF producers have increased market share from approximately 37% in 2000 to 49% in 2017, reflecting growth from 190 million MT to 257 million MT. In APAC, which made up approximately 7% of our 2018 net sales, government initiatives in China are expected to result in a greater use of the EAF method in steelmaking despite the historical dominance of BOF producers. These initiatives are the result of efforts to eliminate excess steelmaking production capacity and to improve environmental conditions. The EAF method produces 
9


approximately 25% of the carbon dioxide (or CO2) emissions of a BOF facility and does not require the smelting of virgin iron ore or the burning of coal. Additionally, as a result of significantly increased steel production in China since 2000, the supply of Chinese scrap is expected to increase substantially, which may result in lower scrap prices and provide the Chinese steel manufacturing industry with local scrap feedstock that was not historically available. We believe these trends will allow EAF steel producers to increase their market share and grow at a faster rate than BOF steel producers, resulting in increasing demand for graphite electrodes.
We have capital‑efficient growth opportunities available to us
The graphite electrode industry responded to oversupplied markets from 2011 to 2015 with production capacity rationalization and consolidation, and after the normalization of the market for EAF steel in 2017. We believe the lead time from initial permitting to full production of a greenfield graphite electrode manufacturing facility would be approximately three to five years and cost approximately $10,000 per MT. Similarly, brownfield development is complicated by significant capital costs and space and process constraints. Only one new greenfield graphite electrode facility outside of China has been built since the 1980s and only one significant brownfield expansion has occurred, reflecting the historical difficulty of adding further graphite electrode production capacity. As a result of this long and uncertain time horizon to build new plants, we believe only a few companies have the necessary technology and expertise to meet the rising demand for graphite electrodes.
Our current facilities are modern, strategically located and well‑maintained, providing us with ample operational optimization capabilities. In 2018, we completed the expansion of our production capacity by approximately 20%, to 202,000 MT, through strategic capital investments and operational improvements. As a result of our prior operational improvement activities, we are able to achieve this large capacity increase with specific, highly targeted capital investments. These expansions will provide additional fixed cost absorption and drive further efficiencies of scale across our manufacturing base. We also have our currently warm idled St. Marys facility, which remains a viable long-term option. Currently, St. Marys is graphitizing and machining some semi‑finished electrodes sourced from Monterrey in order to leverage existing infrastructure. 
We believe we have the industry’s most efficient production platform of high production capacity assets with substantial vertical integration
Based on our experience, high capacity manufacturing facilities can have operating costs of more than $1,000 per MT lower than low capacity manufacturing facilities. Our previous restructuring activities included the closures of our lower capacity manufacturing facilities in South Africa and Brazil and the idling of our St. Marys facility, which together accounted for approximately 35% of our previous production capacity. Our restructuring actions have eliminated a significant amount of annual fixed manufacturing costs and maintenance capital expenditure requirements since 2012. These actions allow us to run our Calais, Pamplona and Monterrey plants at a high level of capacity utilization. Since 2014, we have also improved our manufacturing processes and made strategic investments across our plant network, which have improved productivity while also reducing our energy and raw material consumption. Following our footprint optimization, we are producing a greater quantity of graphite electrodes from our three primary operating facilities than we did from our six operating facilities in 2012. In 2017, the Calais and Pamplona plants exceeded previous annual record production levels by 15% and 12%, respectively, and production at the Monterrey plant was 12% higher than the highest annual production level during the past 10 years. Our recently completed debottlenecking intitiative added approximately 20% to our capacity at a very low cost per MT. We believe that the optimization of our plant network will continue to drive improved fixed cost absorption.
Moreover, our Seadrift, Calais, Pamplona, Monterrey and St. Marys facilities each provide unique advantages for us. Seadrift provides a substantial portion of our petroleum needle coke supply needs internally and at a competitive cost and allows us to maximize capacity utilization more efficiently than competitors, who may be more constrained by petroleum needle coke supply. Seadrift is one of only five petroleum needle coke facilities in the world outside of China, and we believe it is the second largest petroleum needle coke producer in the world. We also believe that Calais, Pamplona and Monterrey are three of the five highest capacity graphite electrode facilities in the world (excluding China), allowing for significant operating leverage. We believe our facilities have significant cost advantages given their scale and access to low cost, reliable energy sources. While much of the production capacity rationalized during the downturn was permanently shut down, we temporarily idled our St. Marys facility and retain the option to restart it. 
We are the only petroleum needle coke producer in the world specifically focused on the production of graphite electrodes
Our production of petroleum needle coke specifically for graphite electrodes provides us the opportunity to produce super premium petroleum needle coke of the highest quality and allows us to tailor graphite electrodes for customer requirements. Seadrift has 140,000 MT of petroleum needle coke production capacity, which we believe makes it the second largest petroleum needle coke producer in the world. We produced approximately 110,000 MT of needle coke in 2018. We expect to produce approximately 125,000 MT in 2019 as we do not have a planned maintenance outage in 2019 and we expect a modest productivity 
10


enhancement related to our efficiency improvement project. We believe that no petroleum needle coke production capacity has been added outside of China for at least 10 years, given high capital costs and technological barriers. Additionally, the growing petroleum needle coke demand from manufacturers of lithium‑ion batteries for electric vehicles has led to a limited supply of petroleum needle coke available to graphite electrode manufacturers. Sourcing the majority of our petroleum needle coke internally allows us to offer our customers certainty of supply, further enhancing our competitive position and supporting our three‑ to five‑year, take‑or‑pay contracts strategy. To align with our three‑ to five‑year contract profile, we have hedged the decant oil required to produce all of the graphite electrodes sold under these contracts, providing us with substantial visibility into our future raw material costs. We believe our use of petroleum needle coke is a further competitive advantage, as the use of pitch needle coke, an alternative raw material, results in longer bake times during graphite electrode production, significantly affecting graphite electrode production rates and cost. 
Our graphite electrodes and petroleum needle coke are among the highest quality in the industry
After the divestiture of our non‑core legacy Engineered Solutions businesses in 2016 and 2017, we focused on our core competency of graphite electrode production and generated approximately $60 million in cash proceeds and release of working capital from these divestitures. Our restructured and simplified business model has reduced our annual overhead expenses significantly since 2012, allowing us to redeploy the savings into our graphite electrode business. We have identified and implemented mechanical and chemical improvements to our electrodes, invested in the capability to produce super premium petroleum needle coke needed for high‑margin UHP graphite electrodes, and optimized our production of pins at our Monterrey plant, which are a critical component used to connect and fasten graphite electrodes together in a furnace. By producing pins at our Monterrey plant, we are able to realize meaningful fixed‑cost synergies with our graphite electrode production on site. As a result, we believe the quality and the consistency of our electrodes is unrivaled in North America and EMEA and on par with that of any producer globally. We have seen customer satisfaction rise to ten‑year highs at a time when the industry has been focused on production capacity rationalization rather than quality. We believe the durability and infrequent breakage of our graphite electrodes create operating efficiencies and value opportunities for our customers. We also believe we have a competitive advantage in offering customers our ArchiTech Furnace Productivity System (or ArchiTech), which we believe is the most advanced support and technical service platform in the graphite electrode industry. ArchiTech, which has been installed in customer furnaces around the world, enables our engineers to work with our customers seamlessly to maximize the performance of their furnaces and provide real‑time diagnostics and troubleshooting. We believe our customers value our high quality products and customer service, and have provided us with opportunities to expand our business with them as a result.
Our experienced executive leadership and general managers and flexible workforce have positioned us for future earnings growth
Our seasoned leadership is committed to earnings growth. We have undertaken strategic investments to increase our production capacity in a capital‑efficient manner while reducing our cost position. Our executive and manufacturing leadership have led manufacturing companies through many cycles and are focused on positioning us for profitable growth in any environment. Our operational improvement and debottlenecking initiative is completed and increased capacity by approximately 20%, or 35,000 MT. Currently, our warm idled St. Marys facility is finishing some electrodes sourced from other facilities to provide flexibility to our overall manufacturing footprint.  We could ramp up production at St. Marys if required to support our customers.  If restarted, St. Marys would add approximately 28,000 MT of annual capacity.
Additionally, since our acquisition by Brookfield, we have reorganized our manufacturing facilities as profit centers. We use LEAN manufacturing techniques, which focus on the constant elimination of waste from the manufacturing process. We also rely on Six Sigma methods, a set of management techniques intended to improve quality by significantly reducing the probability that an error or defect will occur. We believe the LEAN and Six Sigma initiatives have increased overall utilization by optimizing our plant production capacity and controlled costs while also improving quality. We also redesigned general manager incentive plans to reward efficiency gains. Similarly, our labor force is incentivized to drive efficiencies through country‑specific labor incentive plans. 
Facilities
We currently manufacture our graphite electrodes in three manufacturing facilities strategically located in the Americas and EMEA, two of the largest EAF steelmaking markets. Our locations allow us to serve our customers in the Americas and EMEA efficiently and are located near low‑cost and reliable energy sources with essential logistical infrastructure in place. In addition to these three facilities, we have a fourth graphite electrode manufacturing site in St. Marys, Pennsylvania that is currently warm idled. We estimate that the 202,000 MT of graphite electrode production capacity at our three primary operating sites represents approximately 24% of estimated global graphite electrode production capacity (excluding China). Due to our productivity 
11


improvement efforts, and because of the increased demand for graphite electrodes, we achieved near 100% capacity utilization at our Calais, France, Pamplona, Spain and Monterrey, Mexico plants in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, the Calais and Pamplona plants exceeded previous annual record production levels by 15% and 12%, respectively, and production at the Monterrey plant was 12% higher than the highest annual production level during the past 10 years. In 2018, we added capacity to all three locations through our debottlenecking initiative. We believe our business has the lowest manufacturing cost structure of all of our major competitors, primarily due to the large scale of our manufacturing facilities.
Our manufacturing facilities significantly benefit from their size and scale, work force flexibility, access to attractively‑priced sources of power and other key raw materials, and our substantial vertical integration with Seadrift. By operating three of the five highest capacity graphite electrode production facilities in the world, we are able to achieve meaningful operating leverage relative to our competitors. Because of the attractive cost of labor available to our Monterrey facility, we believe we have a significant cost advantage in the production of pins, which are used to connect and fasten graphite electrodes together in a furnace and are more labor‑intensive to produce than other graphite electrodes. Our Calais, Pamplona and Monterrey facilities have access to low‑cost sources of electricity, a significant element of our manufacturing costs. Our Seadrift facility currently produces approximately 70% of our petroleum needle coke requirements for our graphite electrode production, allowing us to source our primary raw material internally and at cost, a significant advantage relative to our peers. Seadrift also produces sufficient needle coke to supply substantially all of the graphite electrode production that we have contracted under our take‑or‑pay contracts.
The recent transformation in the industry was driven in part by substantial production capacity rationalization and consolidation. We estimate that, at the beginning of 2014, the graphite electrode industry globally (excluding China) had capacity to produce approximately 1.0 million MT of graphite electrodes across 30 graphite electrode manufacturing facilities. We estimate that the industry outside of China has closed or repurposed approximately 20% of production capacity from 2014-2016, reducing production capacity to approximately 800,000 MT of electrodes. Moreover, the third‑largest producer has acquired the second‑largest producer. As part of this overall industry rationalization, we permanently shut down two plants and temporarily idled our St. Marys plant, reducing our electrode manufacturing from six operating facilities in 2012 to three operating facilities in 2017. Despite this, we are producing a greater quantity of graphite electrodes in 2018 from our three primary operating facilities than we did in 2012 from our six facilities. We believe worldwide graphite electrode production capacity, excluding China, has now increased to approximately 850,000 MT.
Manufacturing
We manufacture graphite electrodes ranging in size up to 30 inches in diameter, over 11 feet in length, and weighing as much as 5,900 pounds (2.6 MT). The manufacturing process includes six main processes: screening of raw materials (needle coke) and blending with coal tar pitch followed by forming, or extrusion, of the electrode, baking the electrode, impregnating the electrode with a special pitch that improves strength, re‑baking the electrode, graphitizing the electrode using electric resistance furnaces, and machining. The first baking process converts the pitch into hard coke. During the baking process, the electrode pitch volatiles are removed, leaving porosities inside. To improve graphite electrode quality, the electrode is then impregnated with additional coal tar pitch to fill the porosities and baked a second time. After impregnation and re‑baking, the manufacturing process continues with graphitization as the electrodes are heated at 5000°F in a special longitudinal furnace to convert the carbon into graphite. The graphitization cycle removes additional impurities and improves the electrodes’ key qualities: thermal and electrical conductivity, thermal shock resistance performance, lubricity, and abrasion resistance. Graphitization is energy intensive, and, according to CRU International Ltd (or CRU), requires around 3200 to 4800 kWh electricity per MT, representing 20% to 35% of the total electrode costs.
High quality graphite electrodes have low electrical resistivity and strong durability. Resistivity is enhanced by removing impurities during the production process, while durability is determined by the coefficient of thermal expansion (or CTE) of the raw material used to produce the graphite electrode. Lower CTE needle coke produces higher quality electrodes. UHP electrodes used in harsh EAF melter applications have low resistivity and low CTE to maximize efficient use of electricity in the EAF and minimize electrode consumption. The total manufacturing time of a graphite electrode and its associated connecting pin is on average approximately six months from needle coke production to customer delivery. We believe that the period of time required to produce a graphite electrode meaningfully constrains the ability of graphite electrode producers to react to real‑time changes in steel market environments and acts as a barrier to entry.
Production of a graphite electrode begins with the production of either petroleum needle coke, our primary raw material, or pitch needle coke, a less favorable substitute for petroleum needle coke. Petroleum needle coke is produced through a manufacturing process very similar to a refinery. The production process converts decant oil, a byproduct of the gasoline refining process, into petroleum needle coke and generally takes two to three months to produce. Needle coke takes its name from the needle‑like shape of the coke particles. We produce calcined petroleum needle coke at Seadrift. Seadrift is not dependent on any single refinery for decant oil. While Seadrift has purchased a substantial majority of its raw material inventory from a limited number of suppliers in recent years, we believe that there is a large supply of suitable decant oil in the United States available 
12


from a variety of sources. In addition, we use derivatives to hedge the decant oil required to produce all of the graphite electrodes sold under our three‑ to five‑year take or pay contracts, providing us with substantial visibility into our future raw material costs. Seadrift is one of the three largest petroleum needle coke facilities in the world.
We purchase the electric power used in our manufacturing processes from local suppliers under contracts with pricing based on rate schedules or price indices. Our electricity costs can vary significantly depending on these rates and usage. Natural gas used in the baking and re‑baking processes is purchased from local suppliers primarily under annual volume contracts with pricing based on various natural gas price indices.
Sales and customer service
We differentiate and sell the value of our graphite electrodes primarily based on price, product quality and performance, delivery reliability and customer technical service.
We have a large customer technical service organization, with supporting application engineering and scientific groups and more than 30 engineers and specialists around the world serving in this area. We believe that we are one of the industry leaders in providing value added technical services to our customers.
Our direct sales force currently operates from 10 sales offices located around the world. We sell our graphite electrodes primarily through our direct sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors, all of whom are trained and experienced with our products.
We have customer technical service personnel based around the world to assist customers to maximize their production and minimize their costs. A portion of our engineers and technicians provide technical service and advice to key steel and other metals customers. These services relate to furnace applications and operation, as well as furnace upgrades to reduce energy consumption, improve raw material costs and increase output.
We believe we have a competitive advantage in offering customers ArchiTech, which we believe is the most advanced support and technical service platform in the graphite electrode industry. ArchiTech, which has been installed in customer furnaces worldwide, enables our engineers to work with our customers seamlessly to maximize the performance of their furnaces and provide real‑time diagnostics and troubleshooting.
Distribution
We deploy various demand management and inventory management techniques to seek to ensure that we can meet our customers’ delivery requirements while still maximizing the capacity utilization of our production capacity. We can experience significant variation in our customers’ delivery requirements as their specific needs vary and change through the year. We generally seek to maintain appropriate inventory levels, taking into account these factors as well as the significant differences in manufacturing cycle times for graphite electrode products and our customers’ products.
Finished products are usually stored at our manufacturing facilities. Limited quantities of some finished products are also stored at local warehouses around the world to meet customer needs.
Contracts and Customers
In 2017, we reoriented our commercial strategy around a three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contract framework and restructured our sales force incentives. As graphite electrodes are an essential consumable in the EAF steel production process and require a long lead time to manufacture, our strategic customers are highly focused on securing certainty of supply of reliable, high quality graphite electrodes. Prior to our three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contract initiative, our sales of graphite electrodes were generally negotiated annually through purchase orders on an uncontracted, nonbinding basis. The majority of our customers sought to secure orders for a supply of their anticipated volume requirements each upcoming year. The remaining, small balance of our graphite electrode customers purchased their electrodes as needed throughout the year at industry spot prices.
We believe we are uniquely capable among graphite electrode producers to pursue our three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracting strategy due to our substantial vertical integration into petroleum needle coke production. All of our petroleum needle coke production is used internally and is not sold to external customers. Demand for petroleum needle coke increased due to the use of needle coke in lithium‑ion batteries for electric vehicles, as well as increased demand for graphite electrodes. Consequently, we expect this limited availability of petroleum needle coke will restrict new graphite electrode production. Seadrift, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired in 2010, provides approximately 70% of our petroleum needle coke requirements and produces sufficient needle coke to supply substantially all of the graphite electrode production that we have contracted under our take‑or‑pay contracts. 
13


We have hedged the decant oil required to produce all of the graphite electrodes sold under these contracts, providing us substantial visibility into our future raw material costs.
Because the market price of graphite electrodes may be based, in part, on the current or forecasted costs of key raw materials, periods of raw material price volatility may have an impact on the market price. In particular, as petroleum needle coke represents a significant percentage of the raw material cost of graphite electrodes, the price of graphite electrodes has historically been influenced by the price of petroleum needle coke. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-pricing for graphite electrodes has historically been cyclical and current prices are relatively high, however, the price of graphite electrodes may decline in the future.” The fixed prices under our contracts prevent us from passing along changes related to our costs of raw materials to our customers. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-We are dependent on the supply of petroleum needle coke. Our results of operations could deteriorate if recent disruptions in the supply of petroleum needle coke continue or worsen for an extended period.” However, as described above, we believe our ability to source all of our petroleum needle coke requirements for these contracts from our Seadrift facility and our hedging of our purchases of decant oil mitigates the impact of periodic shortages and price fluctuations of raw materials.
We have executed three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts, representing approximately 674,000 MT, or approximately 60% to 65% of our cumulative expected production capacity from 2018 through 2022. Approximately 90% of the contracted volumes have terms extending to 2022. We have contracted to sell approximately 147,000, 144,000, 127,000 and 120,000 MT in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Approximately 83% of these volumes are under pre‑determined fixed annual volume contracts, while approximately 17% of the volumes are under contracts with a specified volume range. The aggregate difference between the midpoint and the minimum or maximum volumes across our cumulative portfolio of take‑or‑pay contracts with specified volume ranges is approximately 5,000 MT per year in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. 
All of our take‑or‑pay contracts have fixed prices. The weighted average contract price for the contracted volumes over the next four years is approximately $9,700 per MT, with the weighted average contract prices for contracts with a specified volume range computed using the volume midpoint. Weighted average contract prices for our contracted volume will differ from the weighted average realized prices that we will actually realize for all MT of graphite electrodes we sell in these years because contracted volumes represent only a portion of our production capacity.
Three‑ to Five‑Year Take‑or‑Pay Contract Volume and Price Profile

(1) | Contract volume reflects volumes contracted under three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts. Contract volume in the above graph reflects the midpoint of the contracts with a specified volume range.


(2) | Weighted average contract price reflects the volume‑weighted average price for graphite electrodes at which we have entered into three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts as of the date hereof. For those contracts with a specified volume range, weighted average contract prices are computed using the volume midpoint.

Within this contract framework, our customers agree to purchase a specified volume of product at the price under the contract. Contract customers are unable to renegotiate or adjust the price under the contract and order. These fixed prices under the contracts also prevent us from passing along any changes related to the costs of raw materials to contract customers. As a result of the take‑or‑pay obligation of the contracts, the customer must purchase the annual contracted volume (or annual volume within 
14


the specified range). In the event the customer does not take delivery of the annual volume specified in the contract, our contracts provide for a capacity payment equal to the product of the number of MTs short of the annual volume specified in the contract multiplied by the price under the contract for that contract year.
In addition to defining annual volumes and prices, these three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracts include significant termination payments (typically, 50% to 70% of remaining contracted revenue) and, in certain cases, parent guarantees and collateral arrangements to manage our customer credit risk. In most cases, the customer can only terminate the contract unilaterally: (i) upon certain bankruptcy events; (ii) if we materially breach certain anti‑corruption legislation; (iii) if we are affected by a force majeure event that precludes the delivery of the agreed‑to graphite electrodes for more than a six‑month period; or (iv) if we fail to ship certain minimum levels during a specified period of time. The customer will also be able to temporarily suspend obligations under the contract due to a force majeure event, as will we, with the contract term being extended by a period equal to the duration of such suspension.
Our contracts provide our customers with certain remedies in the event that we are unable to deliver the contracted volumes of graphite electrodes on a quarterly basis. Our substantially vertically integrated Seadrift plant is particularly important to our ability to provide our customers with a reliable supply of graphite electrodes. Therefore, the likelihood that we will fail to deliver the contracted volume is significantly reduced due to our substantial vertical integration. For a discussion of certain risks related to our take‑or‑pay contracting initiative, see “Risk Factors-Risks related to our business and industry-We may be unable to implement our business strategies, including our initiative to secure and maintain three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay customer contracts, in an effective manner.”
We aim to be the leading producer of the highest performing graphite electrodes in order to enhance customer production efficiency. Our global manufacturing network, vertical integration with needle coke and R&D team provide us with competitive advantages in product quality, product costs, and operational flexibility. We continuously work to improve the consistent overall quality of our products and services, including the performance characteristics of each product, and the uniformity of the products manufactured at different facilities. We believe our efforts have succeeded, as in 2017 and 2018 we improved our quality and performance metrics to the highest levels in ten years and added new, leading steelmakers as customers.
Approximately 91% of our graphite electrodes were purchased by EAF steel producers in 2018. The remaining portion is primarily used in various other ferrous and non‑ferrous melting applications, BOF production, fused materials, chemical processing, and alloy metals. In 2018, one customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales. We sell our products in every major geographic region globally. Sales of our products to buyers outside the United States accounted for approximately 83% of net sales in 2016, approximately 81% of net sales in 2017 and approximately 77% of net sales in 2018. Overall, in 2018, we generated more than 93% of our net sales from EMEA and the Americas.
2018 Revenue and production by region and end market
We believe our three‑ to five‑year take‑or‑pay contracting strategy provides cash flow visibility and stability to our customers and, as a result, has secured a high quality customer base. We perform financial and credit reviews of all eligible potential customers prior to entering into these contracts. Less creditworthy customers are required to post a bank guarantee, letter of credit or significant cash prepayment. Based on total revenues over the life of the contracts, our ten largest customers represent 38% of total revenue, while the next ten customers and all other customers represent 17% and 45% of total revenue, respectively. During 2018, approximately 71% of our sales came from our three-to-five year take-or-pay contracts.

Research and development
We have over 130 years of experience in the R&D of graphite‑ and carbon‑based solutions. By focusing our management’s attention and R&D spending exclusively on the graphite electrode business, we have been able to meaningfully improve the quality of our graphite electrodes, repositioning ourselves as an industry quality leader and improving our relationships with strategic customers. Our focus on improving the quality of petroleum needle coke through R&D has led to our petroleum needle coke production at Seadrift now being best‑in‑class for use in the manufacturing of highly durable UHP electrodes. We believe that our technological and manufacturing strengths and capabilities provide us with a significant growth opportunity as well as a competitive advantage.
Intellectual property
We believe that our intellectual property, consisting primarily of patents and proprietary know‑how, provides us with competitive advantages and is important to our growth opportunities. Our intellectual property portfolio is extensive, with approximately 200 carbon and graphite U.S. and foreign patents and published patent applications, which we believe is more than any of our major competitors in the businesses in which we operate.
We own or have obtained licenses for various trade names and trademarks used in our businesses. For example, the trade name and trademark UCAR are owned by Union Carbide Corporation (which was acquired by Dow Chemical Company) and are licensed to us on a worldwide, exclusive and royalty‑free basis until 2025. This particular license automatically renews for successive ten‑year periods. It permits non‑renewal by Union Carbide at the end of any renewal period upon five years’ notice of non‑renewal.
We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as appropriate agreements to protect our intellectual property. Among other things, we seek to protect our proprietary know‑how and information, by requiring employees, consultants, strategic partners and others who have access to such proprietary information and know‑how to enter into confidentiality or restricted use agreements.
Insurance
We maintain insurance against civil liabilities relating to personal injuries to third parties, for loss of or damage to property, for business interruptions and for certain environmental matters, that provides coverage, subject to the applicable coverage limits, deductibles and retentions, and exclusions, that we believe are appropriate upon terms and conditions and for premiums that we consider fair and reasonable in the circumstances. There can be no assurance that we will not incur losses beyond the limits of or outside the coverage of our insurance.
Environment
Our facilities and operations are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations relate to air emissions, water discharges and solid and hazardous waste generation, treatment, storage, handling, transportation and disposal; the presence of wastes and other substances; the reporting of, responses to and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment; and the import, production, packaging, labeling and transportation of products that are defined as hazardous or toxic or otherwise believed to have potential to harm the environment or human health. These laws and regulations (and the enforcement thereof) are periodically updated and are becoming increasingly stringent. We have incurred substantial costs in the past, and will continue to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with these legal requirements.
We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We have experienced some level of regulatory scrutiny at most of our current and former facilities and, in some cases, have been required to take or are continuing to take corrective or remedial actions and incur related costs, and may experience further regulatory scrutiny, and may be required to take further corrective or remedial actions and incur additional costs, in the future. Although it has not been the case in the past, these costs could have a material adverse effect on us in the future.
Further, laws and regulations in various jurisdictions impose or may impose, as the case may be, environmental monitoring, reporting and/or remediation requirements if operations cease or property is transferred or sold. We have sold or closed a number of facilities that had operated solid waste management units (landfills) on‑site. In most cases where we divested the properties, we have retained ownership of on‑site landfills. When our landfills were or are to be sold, we negotiate for contractual provisions providing for financial assurance to be maintained, which we believe will be adequate to protect us from any potential future liability associated with these landfills. When we have closed landfills, we believe that we have done so in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We continue to monitor these landfills and observe any reporting obligations we may have 
16


with respect to them pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. To date, the costs associated with the retained landfills have not had, and we do not anticipate that future costs will have, a material adverse effect on us.
We have received and may in the future receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or U.S. EPA) or state environmental protection agencies, as well as claims from other parties, alleging that we are a potentially responsible party (or PRP) under the Superfund Act and similar state laws for past and future remediation costs at waste disposal sites and other contaminated properties. Although Superfund Act liability is joint and several, in general, final allocation of responsibility at sites where there are multiple PRPs is made based on each PRP’s relative contribution of hazardous substances to the site. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that any potential liability we may have as a PRP will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Certain of our U.S. facilities have been or will be required to comply with reporting requirements under the Federal Clean Air Act and standards for air emissions that have been or may be adopted by the U.S. EPA and state environmental protection agencies pursuant to new and revised regulations, including the possible promulgation of future maximum achievable control technology standards that apply specifically to our manufacturing sector(s), or more generally to our operation(s) or equipment. Achieving compliance with the regulations that have been promulgated to date has resulted in the need for additional administrative and engineered controls, changes to certain manufacturing processes, and increased monitoring and reporting obligations. Similar foreign laws and regulations have been or may also be adopted to establish new standards for air emissions, which may also require best available control technology on our manufacturing operations outside the United States. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that compliance with these regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us.
International accords, foreign laws and regulations, and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations have been enacted to address concerns about the effects that CO2 emissions and other identified greenhouse gases ("GHGs") may have on the environment and climate worldwide. These effects are widely referred to as Climate Change. The international community has taken actions to address Climate Change issues on a global basis. In particular, in December 2015, the 21st Conference of Parties for the UNFCC concluded with more than 190 countries adopting the Paris Agreement, which then came into force and was legally binding on the parties in November 2016. The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature and consists of two elements: a legally binding commitment by each participating country to set an emissions reduction target, referred to as “nationally determined contributions” (or NDCs), with a review of the NDCs that could lead to updates and enhancements every five years beginning in 2023, and a transparency commitment requiring participating countries to disclose in full their progress. Our activities in the EU are subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (or ETS), and it is likely that requirements relating to GHG emissions will become more stringent and will continue to expand to other jurisdictions in the future as NDCs under the Paris Agreement are implemented. In the United States, although the current Administration has announced its intent to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, the EPA currently requires reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources and, in the future, the EPA or states may impose permitting obligations on new sources or existing sources that seek to modify their operations that would otherwise result in an increase in certain GHG emissions.
In the EU, the ETS, which was initially enacted under the provisions of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, requires certain listed energy‑intensive industries to participate in an international “cap and trade” system of GHG emission allowances. A third phase of the EU ETS under Directive 2009/29/EC, covers the period 2013 to 2020 and instituted a number of program changes. EU Member States brought into force the necessary laws, regulations and administrative provisions to comply with this EU Directive. Carbon and graphite manufacturing is still not a covered industry sector in the revised Annex 1 of this Directive. However, one of our European manufacturing operations was required to comply with these provisions under a more general fuel combustion category, because its combustion units met the applicability levels. The operations subject to these provisions was eligible to receive free CO2 emission allowances under the member state allocation program. On November 9, 2017, to implement the EU’s NDC under the Paris Agreement and other GHG commitments, the European Parliament and Council announced a provisional agreement to revise and make more stringent the ETS during the Phase 4 period of 2021 to 2030. Among other changes, the Phase 4 provisions would further accelerate reduction in the current oversupply of allowances in the ETS market and establish further protections against the risks of carbon leakage. After extensive negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council formally supported the revision in February 2018. The revised EU ETS Directive (Directive (EU) 2018/410) entered into force on April 8, 2018. The EU’s current target for 2030 is to achieve a GHG reduction of at least 40% compared to 1990 levels. Implementation of Phase 4 could increase the cost of our current GHG allowances and require us to obtain additional allowances. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that compliance with international accords, U.S. and foreign laws and regulations concerning Climate Change which have been promulgated, or that could be promulgated in the future, including Phase 4 of the ETS, will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Some of our products (including our raw materials) are subject to extensive environmental and industrial hygiene regulations governing the registration and safety analysis of their component substances. For example, in connecting with the EU's Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation ("REACH") or the EU’s Classification, Labelling 
17


and Packaging Regulation, any key raw material, chemical or substance, including our products, could be classified as having a toxicological or health‑related impact on the environment, users of our products, or our employees. Coal tar pitch, which is classified as a substance of very high concern under REACH, is used in certain of our processes, but in a manner that we believe does not require us to obtain a specific authorization under the REACH guidelines.
Estimates of future costs for compliance with U.S. and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations, and for environmental liabilities, are necessarily imprecise due to numerous uncertainties, including the impact of potential new laws and regulations, the availability and application of new and diverse technologies, the extent of insurance coverage, the potential discovery of contaminated properties, or the identification of new hazardous substance disposal sites at which we may be a PRP and, in the case of sites subject to the Superfund Act and similar state and foreign laws, the final determination of remedial requirements and the ultimate allocation of costs among the PRPs. Subject to the inherent imprecision in estimating such future costs, but taking into consideration our experience to date regarding environmental matters of a similar nature and facts currently known, we estimate that our costs and capital expenditures (in each case, before adjustment for inflation) for environmental protection regulatory compliance programs and for remedial response actions will not be material over the next several years. Furthermore, we establish accruals for environmental liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been or will be incurred, and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. We adjust the accrual as new remedial actions or other commitments are made, as well as when new information becomes available that changes the prior estimates previously made and we believe our existing accruals are reasonable.
Employee relations
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,387 employees (excluding contractors). A total of 451 employees were in Europe (including Russia), 710 were in Mexico and Brazil, 3 were in South Africa, 216 were in the United States and 7 were in the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2018, 945 of our employees were hourly employees.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 846 employees, or 61%, of our worldwide employees, are covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 691 employees, or 50%, of our worldwide employees, were covered by agreements that expire, or are subject to renegotiation, at various times through December 31, 2019. We believe that, in general, our relationships with our unions are satisfactory and that we will be able to renew or extend our collective bargaining or similar agreements on reasonable terms as they expire. We cannot assure, however, that renewed or extended agreements will be reached without a work stoppage or strike or will be reached on terms satisfactory to us. As of December 31, 2018, none of the employees in our Seadrift plant or St. Marys facility were covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements.
We have not had any material work stoppages or strikes during the past decade.
Industry
Graphite electrode industry
Graphite electrodes are an industrial consumable product used primarily in EAF steel production. EAFs and BOFs are the two primary technologies for steel production. In the EAF method, steel scrap is melted and recycled to produce liquid steel, while in the BOF method, virgin iron ore is smelted with metallurgical coke, a carbon product derived from metallurgical coal. According to the WSA, in 2017, EAF steel producers accounted for 46%, or 472 million MT, of global crude steel production (excluding China, which almost exclusively uses the BOF method), an increase of 44% since 2000. EAFs have historically been the fastest‑growing segment of the global steel industry due to their greater resilience, more variable cost structure, lower capital intensity and more environmentally friendly nature.
EAF steel producers are the primary consumers of graphite electrodes, and use them to conduct electricity in a furnace, generating an electric arc of sufficient heat to melt scrap metal, iron ore or other raw materials used to produce steel or other metals. EAFs operate using either alternating electric current or direct electric current. The vast majority of EAFs use alternating electric current and typically use nine electrodes (in three columns of three electrodes each) at one time. Direct electric current EAFs typically use one column of three electrodes. Graphite electrodes are the only known commercially available products that have both the capacity to handle high levels of electrical current and the capability to sustain the high levels of heat generated in EAF steel production, making graphite electrodes essential to the EAF process.
The size of the electrodes varies depending on the size of the furnace, the size of the furnace’s electric transformer and the planned productivity of the furnace. In a typical furnace using alternating electric current and operating at a typical number of production cycles per day, three electrodes are fully consumed (requiring the addition of new electrodes), on average, every 8 to 10 operating hours. Graphite electrodes are consumed at a rate of approximately 1.7 kilograms per MT of steel production.
18


The actual rate of consumption and addition of electrodes for a particular furnace depends primarily on the efficiency and productivity of the furnace. Therefore, demand for graphite electrodes is directly related to the amount and efficiency of EAF steel production. EAF steel production requires significant heat (as high as 5,000° F) to melt the raw materials, primarily scrap metal, in the furnace. Heat is generated as electricity (as much as 150,000 amps) passes through the electrodes and creates an electric arc between the electrodes and the raw materials.
Market size and major producers
Electrode production globally (excluding China) is focused on the manufacture of UHP electrodes for EAFs, while the majority of Chinese production is of ladle electrodes for BOFs. UHP electrodes must be able to endure more harsh operating environments than ladle electrodes, as EAFs melt solid scrap steel to a liquid state whereas BOF ladle electrodes are used to maintain the temperature of steel already in a liquid state. UHP electrodes are more difficult to make and are sold at a premium relative to ladle electrodes because their production requires an extensive proprietary manufacturing process and material science knowledge, including the use of superior needle coke blends. As a result, graphite electrode producers outside of China and electrode producers in China are generally not in direct competition for major product lines.
We believe the worldwide graphite electrode production capacity (excluding China) was approximately 800,000 MT in 2018. We believe worldwide graphite electrode production capacity, excluding China, has now increased to approximately 850,000 MT. The industry is fairly consolidated with the top five players holding approximately 82% of the total capacity according to management estimates. The five largest producers in the industry are Showa Denko K.K., GrafTech, Graphite India Limited, Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd. and HEG Ltd. 
Customers of UHP graphite electrode producers primarily include EAF steel producers across the Americas and EMEA. As the capacity utilization and production levels for EAF steel producers have increased beginning in 2017, demand for graphite electrodes exceeded production capacity. Customers have historically procured graphite electrodes through annual agreements negotiated in the third and fourth quarters of each calendar year for graphite electrodes to be delivered the following year. In light of recent market trends described below, certainty of supply of graphite electrodes has become a critical concern for EAF steelmakers.
We believe that greenfield graphite electrode manufacturing projects have been difficult to develop due to significant capital costs, long lead times, technical know‑how, and cumbersome permitting and regulatory regimes. We believe the lead time from initial permitting to full production of a greenfield graphite electrode manufacturing facility would be approximately three to five years and potentially cost as much as approximately $10,000 per MT. Similarly, brownfield graphite electrode manufacturing development is complicated by significant capital costs. Only one greenfield project and one brownfield expansion have been completed since the 1980s outside of China. Therefore, we believe that the industry does not currently have the ability to increase production capacity easily to meet rising demand. Additionally, graphite electrodes require petroleum needle coke, which is an essential raw material for production. Needle coke is in short supply due to demand constraints explained below.
Restructuring of industry production capacity
Supply trends
According to the WSA, between 1984 and 2011, EAF steel production has grown at 3.5% per year, encouraging the growth of the graphite electrode industry. The rapid growth of Chinese steel production, primarily by the BOF method, created an oversupply in steel which led graphite electrode producers to rationalize production capacity and consolidate between 2014 and 2016, a phase which we believe has concluded with renewed EAF steel demand. In 2013, the graphite electrode industry (excluding China) had capacity to produce approximately 1.0 million MT of graphite electrodes across 30 graphite electrode plants. We estimate that from 2014-2016, the industry has closed or repurposed approximately 20% of global production capacity outside of China, consisting of smaller, higher cost facilities. Based on our experience, high capacity manufacturing facilities can have operating costs of more than $1,000 per MT lower than low capacity manufacturing facilities, encouraging producers to consolidate facilities in order to reduce costs.
We believe the majority of the production capacity reduction was permanent due to the demolition, long‑term environmental remediation and repurposing of most of these lower capacity facilities. Additionally, in October 2017, Showa Denko, the industry’s third largest producer, acquired SGL Carbon, the second largest producer. The consolidation and production capacity reductions in the graphite electrode industry, along with the EAF industry’s recovery since 2016, lead us to believe that the graphite electrode industry has recovered from the downturn and will resume its long‑term growth trajectory. We estimate that in 2018, global production capacity (outside of China) was approximately 800,000 MT with a capacity utilization of 
19


approximately 90%, excluding China. We believe worldwide graphite electrode production capacity, excluding China, has now increased to approximately 850,000 MT.
Demand trends
Our graphite electrodes are primarily used in the EAF steelmaking process, and global growth in that market has driven increasing demand for graphite electrodes. EAF steelmaking has historically been the fastest‑growing segment of the global steel market. According to the WSA, EAF steelmaking grew at an average annual rate of 3.5% from 1984, the first year for which data is available for all relevant countries, until 2011, while overall steel production (using all methods) grew at an average annual rate of 2.9%. After average annual declines in EAF steel production of 2.7% from 2011 through 2015, EAF steel production grew by 2.8% in 2016 and 13.7% in 2017. 
This growth has resulted from the development by EAF steelmakers of diversified raw material sources, including non‑scrap materials rich in iron content, such as direct reduced iron and hot briquetted iron. These high quality sources of iron, in addition to technological advances in the EAF process, have enabled EAF steel producers to produce higher quality grades of steel traditionally produced by BOF steelmakers and to enter new markets as a result. EAF steelmakers have therefore been able to increase both market share and overall production. According to the WSA, as of 2017, EAF steel production has grown to 68% of total U.S. steel production from 47% in 2000, 46% of total EMEA steel production from 33% in 2000, and 41% of total APAC (excluding China) steel production from 36% in 2000. Over the same period, global EAF production increased from 287 million MT in 2000 to 472 million MT in 2017, while non‑EAF steel production (excluding China) was relatively flat at 453 million MT in 2000 to 464 in 2017. This ongoing shift toward EAF steelmaking has resulted in increasing demand globally for graphite electrodes.
We believe there is a particular opportunity for EAF steelmaking to take further market share in China as well. China’s 12th Five‑Year Plan, released in 2011, called for EAFs to constitute 20% of overall steel production by 2020. According to the WSA, in 2017, Chinese EAF production increased to 77 million MT, or 9% of China’s total steel production, up from 2016 levels of 51 million MT or 6% of China's total steel production. If Chinese EAF steelmaking production capacity were to reach 20%, based on 2017 production levels, that would add 89 million MT of additional EAF production for a total of 166 million MT, compared to 2017 EAF production in the next largest regions of 68 million MT in the EU, 55 million MT in India and 56 million MT in the United States.
While China’s 13th Five‑Year Plan, released in March 2016, did not explicitly address the EAF target, it did emphasize the importance of environmental efforts, such that 10 of 25 targets in the plan were related to the environment. The Chinese government’s increasing focus on the environment may eventually incentivize steelmakers to convert from BOFs to EAFs in order to continue operating. Significant BOF capacity in the country has been shuttered since 2016 given increasing government‑mandated environmental efforts. China’s rapid increase in BOF steel production between 2000 and 2016 has also created a significant new source of scrap. As a result of these factors, we believe total UHP graphite electrode demand in China will increase in 2019 and going forward. 
Pricing trends
Pricing for graphite electrodes is determined through contract negotiations and spot transactions between producers and consumers. Pricing has historically been cyclical, reflecting the demand trends of the global EAF steelmaking industry and supply of graphite electrodes. Moreover, as petroleum needle coke represents a significant percentage of the raw material cost of graphite electrodes, graphite electrodes have typically been priced at a spread to petroleum needle coke. Over the period from 2008 to 2017, the average graphite electrode spread over petroleum needle coke was approximately $3,000 per MT, on an inflation‑adjusted basis using constant 2018 dollars. In tight demand markets, this spread has increased, resulting in higher graphite electrode prices. We believe that the new source of demand for petroleum needle coke presented by lithium‑ion battery producers for electric vehicles will place upward pressure on petroleum needle coke pricing compared to historical levels. While there is no widely accepted graphite electrode reference price, we believe that our weighted average realized prices are indicative of prices in the overall industry. Historically, between 2008 and 2017, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes was approximately $4,500 per MT (on an inflation‑adjusted basis using constant 2018 dollars).
During the most recent demand trough, our weighted average realized price of graphite electrodes fell to approximately $2,500 per MT in 2016. Following the significant rationalization of graphite electrode production globally, the resumption of growth in EAF steel production, falling scrap prices, reductions in Chinese steel, and constrained supply of needle coke, graphite electrode spot prices increased in late 2017 and 2018. As of February 2019, current spot prices were approximately $12,000 per MT.

Needle coke industry
Introduction
Needle coke is the primary raw material for the production of graphite electrodes used by EAF steelmakers and producers of aluminum, stainless steel, silicon metals and other ferrous and non‑ferrous metals, and is also a key raw material in the production of lithium‑ion batteries used to power electric vehicles. Needle coke is derived from two carbon sources. Petroleum needle coke is produced through a manufacturing process very similar to a refinery. The production process converts decant oil, a byproduct of the gasoline refining process, into petroleum needle coke and generally takes two months to produce. Pitch needle coke, used principally by Asian graphite electrode manufacturers, is made from coal tar pitch, a byproduct of coking metallurgical coal used in BOF steelmaking.
Graphite electrode producers combine petroleum and pitch needle coke with binders and other ingredients to form graphite electrodes. Petroleum and pitch needle coke, relative to other varieties of coke, are distinguished by their needle‑like structure and their quality, which is measured by the presence of impurities, principally sulfur, nitrogen and ash. Petroleum and pitch needle coke are typically low in these impurities. Additionally, the needle‑like structure of petroleum and pitch needle coke creates expansion along the length of the electrode, rather than the width, which reduces the likelihood of fractures. In order to minimize fractures caused by disproportionate expansion over the width of an electrode, and minimize the effect of impurities, large‑diameter graphite electrodes (18 inches to 32 inches) employed in high‑intensity EAF applications are comprised almost exclusively of petroleum and pitch needle coke.
The process map below shows the raw materials required to make graphite electrodes, the various consumers of these raw materials, as well as the consumers of graphite electrodes.

Source: Management Estimates
Previously, producers of petroleum needle coke typically agreed to supply petroleum needle coke in twelve‑month contracts; however, in 2017, producers of petroleum needle coke only agreed to six‑month contracts. This practice has continued in 2018 and 2019. As a result, our competitors must continually renegotiate supply agreements in response to changing market 
21


conditions. We are substantially vertically integrated through our ownership of our Seadrift facility, which provides approximately 70% of our needle coke requirements and insulates us from rapid changes in the needle coke market.
Market size and major producers
The needle coke industry is highly concentrated with approximately ten major producers of needle coke and only four major producers of petroleum needle coke, excluding China. These firms include Phillips 66 (U.S.), Seadrift (GrafTech), Petrocokes Japan Limited (Japan), JX Nippon Oil & Energy Co., Ltd. (Japan) and Petrochina International Jinzhou Co., Ltd. (China), which produce petroleum needle coke, and Mitsubishi Chemical Company, Baosteel Group (China), C‑Chem Co., Ltd. (Japan), Indian Oil Company Limited (India), JX Holdings Inc. (Japan), Petrochina International Jinzhou Co., Ltd. (China) and Anshan Kaitan Thermo‑Energy New Materials Co. Ltd (China), which produce pitch needle coke. We believe that Phillips 66 and Seadrift are the largest and second largest needle coke producers in the world, respectively. We estimate that Seadrift has approximately 19% of the petroleum needle coke production capacity outside China.
Graphite electrode manufacturers prefer petroleum needle coke because of the meaningfully longer bake and graphitizing time required for pitch needle coke and the subsequent impact on graphite electrode production throughput. Electric vehicle manufacturers prefer petroleum needle coke in lithium‑ion batteries because of its greater energy density, providing batteries with longer driving ranges and longevity.

Industry trends
Petroleum needle coke production capacity, excluding China, has remained unchanged for at least the last 10 years due to the capital intensity, technical know‑how and long lead times required to build greenfield needle coke production facilities and the stringent regulatory process associated with building new needle coke production capacity. Furthermore, we believe that brownfield expansion opportunities are generally not available as petroleum needle coke manufacturing is a continuous process with significant costs associated with shutting down and restarting facilities for maintenance or capital investment.
While supply has become constrained, demand for petroleum needle coke is increasing due to the use of needle coke in lithium‑ion batteries used in electric vehicles. The International Energy Agency (or IEA) estimates that the global electric car stock exceeded three million vehicles in 2017, tripling from 2015 levels. The IEA further projects that the global electric car stock may range between 9 million and 20 million by 2020, and between 40 million and 70 million by 2025. Most electric vehicles rely on lithium‑ion batteries as their key performance component. In the last two years, manufacturers of lithium‑ion batteries for electric vehicles have begun using needle coke instead of other forms of graphite as a raw material for carbon anodes in their batteries due to technological advances and the consistent quality that needle coke provides. We expect that lithium‑ion battery manufacturers will continue to prefer petroleum needle coke instead of pitch needle coke for the majority of their supply, due to petroleum needle coke’s better energy density and superior energy storage. These qualities provide lithium‑ion batteries made with petroleum needle coke with longer potential driving ranges and battery lives. According to the ICC, electric vehicles comprised approximately

220,000 MT of total demand for needle coke in 2018, up 84% from 2017. Based on IEA’s estimates of growth in electric vehicle stock to 2025, requirements for petroleum needle coke to fulfill demand would grow exponentially.
EAF steel industry
Emergence and initial period of growth
According to the WSA, global EAF production grew at a 3.5% compound annual growth rate from 1984 to 2011, while taking share from other methods of steelmaking in most regions of the world, outside of China. EAFs benefit from their flexibility in sourcing iron units, being able to make steel from either scrap or alternative sources of iron like direct reduced iron and hot briquetted iron, both made directly from iron ore. Most of the growth in EAF steelmaking has taken place in Western Europe and North America, two regions with substantial amounts of scrap available for use in EAFs.

Industry disruption 2011 to 2015
According to the WSA, EAF steel production declined approximately 10% from 2011 to 2015, reversing a trend of annual growth from 1984 to 2011, largely due to substantial increases in Chinese steel production. In 1984, China produced 21 million MT of BOF steel, which by 2017 had grown to 754 million MT, representing approximately 91% of its total steel production. Growth in production capacity surpassed growth in demand, resulting in significant excess capacity within China and increased exports into global markets. China net steel exports peaked at 112 million MT in 2015. These exports negatively affected steel prices and led EAF producers to reduce production. In 2011, EAF production globally was 454 million MT representing 30% of global steel production, but by 2015, EAF production had declined to 407 million MT, representing 25% of global steel production respectively. Declining EAF production significantly impacted demand for our graphite electrode products.
EAFs recovering and positioned for long‑term growth
The EAF steel industry has recovered since the downturn from 2011 to 2015. EAF production started to recover in 2016 with growth of 2.8%, according to the WSA. EAF production is now rebounding very strongly. WSA reported an 14% growth in EAF production in 2017. This recovery has taken place since China began in 2015 to restructure its steel industry by encouraging consolidation and shutting down excess capacity. China has also begun to implement increased environmental regulations to improve air quality, which has been impacted by CO2 emissions associated with the burning of coal in BOF steelmaking. Additionally, developed economies such as North America and Western Europe have implemented trade decisions against BOF steel‑producing countries to protect their domestic steel industries against imports. These actions have resulted in a significant decrease in Chinese steel exports. According to China Customs and Baiinfo, Chinese steel exports have declined from 112 million MT in 2015 to 70 million MT in 2018. This reduction in exports has resulted in increased steel production outside of China, especially EAF steel production.

Outlook
We expect EAF steel production to continue to grow globally. In 2000, according to the WSA, EAF steel production represented 47% of total U.S. steel production, increasing to 68% of total U.S. steel production by 2017. In absolute terms, total EAF production in the United States increased from 48 million MT in 2000 to 56 million MT in 2017. In 2000, EAF steel production reflected 33% of total EMEA steel production, increasing to 46% of total EMEA steel production by 2017. This represented an increase in total EAF production in EMEA from 111 million MT in 2000 to 166 million MT in 2017. In 2000, 36% of total APAC (excluding China) steel production was by the EAF method, representing 77 million MT of EAF production. This share of production increased to 41% of total APAC (excluding China) steel production by 2017; this represents 137 million MT of EAF production, or an incremental increase of 60 million MT. As a result, we believe there is substantial opportunity for trends in the U.S. and EMEA steel markets to replicate elsewhere.
China also represents a significant opportunity for EAF growth and market share expansion. Chinese steel production today is substantially through the BOF method, but increasing focus on environmental protection within China may encourage conversion from BOFs to EAFs. In its 12th Five‑Year Plan, the Chinese government set a goal of achieving 20% EAF market share by 2020. While China’s 13th Five‑Year Plan, released in March 2016, did not explicitly address the EAF target, it did emphasize the importance of environmental efforts, such that 10 of 25 targets in the plan were related to the environment. The government’s increasing focus on the environment may eventually incentivize steelmakers to convert from BOFs to EAFs in order to continue operating. Additionally, the rapid historical increase in Chinese steel production has resulted in increasing supplies of scrap, making EAFs more cost attractive relative to BOFs. According to McKinsey, so much scrap is expected to become available that EAF production capacity in China would need to triple by 2020 to keep pace. Steel producers may conclude that lower‑capital intensity mini‑mills are more attractive investment opportunities than rebuilding blast furnaces as they age, further supporting demand for graphite electrodes. China’s crude steel output from electric arc furnace producers is estimated to reach 90-100 million metric tons in 2018. This would mark a 20%-30% increase over 2017, S&P Global Platts calculates.
