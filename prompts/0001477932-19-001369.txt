ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and manufacturing of drug formulation and drug delivery technologies in novel dosage forms to improve drug safety, efficacy and patient adherence. Our mission to improve lives by redefining how medications are delivered and experienced. Our business strategy is to develop products using our proprietary technology, which may include clinical development and regulatory approval, and license the product rights to partners responsible for marketing, sales and distribution, while retaining exclusive manufacturing rights. We operate in a 25,000 square foot cGMP manufacturing plant in Oxnard, CA.
 
Our technology platform includes oral dissolving film (“ODF”) and transdermal formulations. We apply our technology to pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements. ODF products are about the size of a postage stamp and composed of excipients such as polymers, stabilizers, lipids and surfactants which are all generally recognized as safe. They can be designed to deliver active ingredients to the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract when placed on the tongue and swallowed, or directly to the blood stream when placed under the tongue (sublingual) or on the inner lining of the cheek and lip (buccal).
 
We currently have two commercial products and several development programs underway: 
 
CURE 3068 (CUREfilm Sleep – Commercially Launched)
 
This is a melatonin-containing sleep aid CUREfilm ODF that is manufactured and sold as a dietary supplement under the brand name “ID Life Sleep Strips”. Our non-exclusive distributor is ID Life, a health and wellness company focused on customized nutrition and selling within the United States. We completed a purchase order with ID Life for approximately 3,200,000 units of product in 2018 and we are seeking additional distributors.
 
CURE 5079 (CUREfilm Sleep – Commercially Launched)
 
This novel sleep aid containing a dietary cannabinoid CUREfilm ODF was launched Q3 2018 by Incubrands under the brand name “Sleep Stripzzz”. The distribution rights were exclusive through the end of 2018. A purchase order was placed on February 22, 2018.
 
CURE 5003 (CUREfilm Blue)
 
We are developing a sildenafil CUREfilm ODF for oral administration. The product, which will be launched for the treatment of erectile disorder, is in early stage clinical development with human studies planned in 2019.
 
CURE 5067 (CUREfilm D)
 
We are developing a 50,000IU, once per week, Vitamin D3 CUREfilm ODF for oral administration. On February 18, 2017, we entered into an exclusive 5-year license and distribution agreement with Meroven Limited in the MENA region: Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Syria, UAE, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Sudan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria and Africa. The product is currently in the optimization development stage. We are seeking distributors in other territories.
CURE 5200
 
We are developing a novel CUREfilm ODF substrate with an undisclosed partner. On June 4, 2018, we entered into a development agreement with an undisclosed partner for product development feasibility of CURE 5200. In order to protect CURE’s and our partner’s competitive advantage, no details of the product have been disclosed at this stage.
CURE 5209
 
We are developing a CUREfilm ODF for mood enhancement as a dietary supplement. On May 30, 2018, we entered into a development agreement with an undisclosed partner for product development feasibility of CURE 5209. In order to protect CURE’s and our partner’s competitive advantage, no further details of the product have been disclosed at this stage.
 
CURE 5210 (CUREfilm Beta-Caryophyllene)

Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formerly named Makkanotti Group Corp. which was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.
 
On November 7, 2016, the board of directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of registrant’s common stock executed a written consent to change registrant’s name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. The Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on November 30, 2016.
 
Further, on November 7, 2016, we, in a reverse take-over transaction, acquired a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company based in California that specializes in drug delivery technologies, by executing a Share Exchange Agreement and Conversion Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) by and among us and a holder of a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock prior to the closing (the “Majority Stockholder”), on the one hand, and CURE Pharmaceutical, all of the shareholders of CURE Pharmaceutical’s issued and outstanding share capital (the “CURE Pharm Shareholders”) and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of CURE Pharmaceutical (“CURE Pharm Noteholders”), on the other hand. Hereinafter, this share exchange transaction is described as the “Share Exchange.”
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, CURE Pharmaceutical became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and the CURE Pharmaceutical Shareholders and CURE Pharmaceutical Noteholders became our controlling shareholders owning, at such time, approximately 65% of our issued and outstanding common stock.
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business, CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation, located in Oxnard, California was originally incorporated in July 2011 to develop novel drug formulation and delivery technologies.
 
The pharmaceutical industry is facing ever-growing R&D expenditures and fewer new drug approvals as a result of increasing regulation, a failure to predict safety problems or a lack of efficacy early in a drug’s development, and high investment in new technologies to improve the speed and accuracy of drug development. Researching and developing new molecular entities (NMEs) is risky as measured by an ever-increasing R&D spend (13.4% average increase per year), low clinical trial success rate (10%) and sluggish NME drug approvals – with 55 NMEs approved in 2018. Faced with these challenges, drug developers are looking toward alternative dosage forms, for which R&D investments dwarve those of NMEs. Alternative dosage forms can address safety and efficacy limitations observed during clinical development of an NME using conventional formulations, by improving its pharmacokinetic profile. 
 
In addition to these challenges, many marketed drugs are coming off-patent, creating a need to fill revenue gaps. Novel dosage forms can offer strategies for surviving patent cliffs by extending market exclusivity when they addresses a bona fide unmet need.
 
The pharmaceutical industry is also challenged by the many patients who do not adhere to a regime of prescription drugs because of side effects, difficulty in administration or the taste of a drug. According to HealthPrize and Capgemini, the loss of global revenues by drug makers due to non-adherence to medicines is $630 billion every year and according to a recent paper published in The Annals of Pharmacotherapy titled "Cost of Prescription Drug-Related Morbidity and Mortality" the estimated annual cost of prescription drug-related morbidity and mortality resulting from nonoptimized medication therapy was $528.4 billion in 2016 US dollars and about 275,689 deaths per year. Medication adherence and the patient experience can be improved with strategies such as replacing an injectable drug with a sublingual drug, simplifying the dosing schedule with a sustained release dosage form and reducing toxicities by avoiding the GI tract (e.g. through transdermal or transmucosal delivery).
 
Improved formulations can address these many challenges by cutting down development costs, reducing the time to market, extending product patent protection, improving patient compliance and increasing drug efficacy. For example, reformulation can enable drug repositioning, the process of finding new uses for failed drugs, such as those abandoned for lack of efficacy or excessive toxicity after Phase II trials, or marketed drugs for which new uses will extend patent life and, therefore, profitability.

The FDA approves more reformulations than new chemical entities (NCEs) each year under Section (505)(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (“505(b)(2)”) the FDA. The number of 2017 NDA approvals that used the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway rose dramatically from 45 approvals in each of the last two years to an all-time high of 63 in 2017. Under Section (505)(b)(2), the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or indication for use. Taken together, the exclusivity period of a drug and the lower R&D cost for reformulating a drug, have led to some pharmaceutical companies investigating reformulating their drugs as part of their lifecycle management protocols.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our commercial strategy is designed to mitigate risk by pursuing a diversified model in the following categories:
 
Pharmaceuticals
 
We partner with companies that are responsible for marketing and distribution of the products we develop and manufacture. On a case-by-case basis, we may be responsible for clinical development and regulatory approval with the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies. Deal terms may include upfront licensing fees, development costs, milestone payments, royalties and exclusive manufacturing rights. Within this category, we are pursuing products with 505(b)(2) approval pathways such as Sildenafil CUREfilm. While we currently manufacture nutraceutical products in our state-of-the-art cGMP oral dissolving film manufacturing facility, we are undertaking steps to manufacture pharmaceutical products for commercial use.
Cannabinoids
 
We are specifically investing in pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid products, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The oral bioavailability of cannabinoids is very low due to extensive “first-pass” metabolism. Consequently, potency and release times are unpredictable and inconsistent. Moreover, cannabinoids do not readily dissolve in water which adds to dosing difficulties and discrepancies. In addition to improving bioavailability, CUREfilm enables the loading of combinations of cannabinoids and botanical extracts which may provide maximum therapeutic benefit. We have a licensing rights agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy”) for the global commercialization of ODFs containing cannabinoids, under which Canopy is granted non-exclusive in the United States and exclusive rights in the rest of the world excluding Asia. We are sponsoring preclinical cannabinoid research at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, where the laboratory of Dr. Dedi Meiri is identifying specific combinations of cannabinoids with anti-tumor effects. We are registered with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) to manufacture schedule 1 controlled substances at the Oxnard facility.
Nutraceuticals
 
Increasingly, patients are encouraged to take part in their own treatments, and a consumer market has been developing midway between the supermarket-based world of consumer goods companies and the scientific, pharmacy-based world of pharmaceutical firms. The front lines of this battle are nutraceutical products that have been proven to help prevent or cure disease. Breakthroughs in functional medicine suggest a number of opportunities for pharmaceutical companies like CURE. Functional medicines focus on the imbalances underlying disease processes (rather than only symptomatic relief) and they rely on molecular nutrition for patient-specific solutions. These types of nutraceuticals can be synergistic with pharmaceutical treatments. We therefore focus on evidence-based nutraceuticals that are differentiated by using proprietary and/or proven active ingredients that we formulate for greater stability, overall quality and increased bioavailability. Nutraceutical products do not require FDA approval but do require following all GMPs. Thus, they are less costly and faster to launch in the marketplace. While manufacturing fees for nutraceuticals have lower margins than prescription drugs, they provide us with short term revenue opportunities.

Underserved Patient Populations
 
On November 10, 2017, we received 269,000 shares of Oak Therapeutics as consideration for an exclusive license to certain patents rights and trademarks of CURE for the commercialization of products in developing nations as defined in the 2013 International Statistics Institute. As a result of this transaction, we own approximately 63% of Oak’s outstanding shares and have consolidated Oak’s financial statements as of the fourth quarter 2017. Oak has completed a Phase I Small Business Innovative Research Contract (“SBIR”) from the National Institutes of Health to develop a formulation for 300mg of Isoniazid in a rapidly dissolving film as an anti-tuberculosis treatment option. Oak applied for Phase II grant of the SBIR program which was not awarded.
 
CUREfilmTM Technology
 
The founders of CURE Pharmaceutical are pioneers in drug delivery and ODF, having launched the first therapeutic ODF product, Chloraseptic® relief strips in 2003. ODF products are about the size of a postage stamp and can deliver medicines through the mucosal tissue in the mouth, sublingually or buccally – on the cheek or more traditionally via the GI tract. Oral transmucosal drug delivery is a non-invasive route for drug delivery that allows for absorption directly into the vascularized tissue in the mouth, bypassing the hepatic first pass effect. This leads to reduced drug exposure and can offer a rapid onset of action. As an oral ODF, active ingredients can be either pre-solubilized within the matrix or encapsulated, or both for more effective GI absorption and/or sustained release. The quick dissolution nature of ODF means that no water is required for administration, improving patient compliance - especially among the elderly, children, and in conditions where patients have difficulty in swallowing.
 
ODFs have significant advantages compared to other dosage forms (e.g., tablets and capsules), including:
 
Safety and Efficacy
 
 
· | Potential for rapid onset of action which can be especially useful for indications such as motion sickness, erectile dysfunction, seizures, allergic attack or coughing, bronchitis or asthma.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Potential to extend a drug’s half-life and consequently extending dosage intervals 
· | Transmucosal delivery can improve a drug’s safety profile of therapy such as reduced gastric irritation 
· | Transmucosal delivery can improve a drug’s efficacy in patients with GI absorption issues. 
· | Accuracy in the administered dose can be better assured for each film. 

Patient Experience and Medication Adherence
 
 
· | Difficulty swallowing tablets and capsules can be a problem for many individuals and can lead to a variety of adverse events and patient noncompliance with treatment regimens. It is estimated that over 16 million people in the United States have some difficulty swallowing, also known as dysphagia. Studies in adults evaluating the effect of tablet and capsule size on ease of swallowing suggest that increases in size are associated with increases in patient complaints related to swallowing difficulties at tablet sizes greater than approximately 8 mm in diameter. ODFs can readily be taken without the need to swallow or use of water or other beverages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Upon administration, there is a relatively low risk of the patient choking which can be most beneficial for patients suffering from motion sickness, dysphagia and repeated emesis. 
· | Easily administered to bedridden and non-cooperative patients (e.g., geriatric, pediatric, and psychiatric). They are hard to spit out. 
· | Configured with physical dimensions such that it is relatively easy and convenient to store and carry. Patients can conveniently carry multiple dissolvable films in his or her pocket or wallet. A single dose of strip can be carried individually without requiring the secondary container. 
· | ODFs are flexible with a pleasant mouth feel unlike oral dissolvable tablets which are brittle.

Manufacturing and logistics
 
 
· | The pouches or sachets offer larger printable 2D areas which traditional drug product formats do not. This allows the manufacturer to adapt to rapidly evolving labeling and regulatory requirements for information and anti-counterfeiting, such as product serialization.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The manufacturing process has a low carbon foot print, with lower use of water for component preparation and sterilization as compared with other dosage forms. 
· | Even though not necessarily sterile, each dose unit is packed individually avoiding contact with other units. 
· | Tensile strength and plasticity of ODF allow for handling single, individual dose units without damage to the dosage form. 
· | Multiple SKUs can be produced by simply modifying the length of the ODF 
· | Enables anti-counterfeit management and dose management 
· | Adaptable for use with dispensing devices for pharmacy preparation or self-administration 
· | Can be easily and conveniently handled, stored, and transported at room temperature 

 
The CUREfilm platform is a scalable and versatile formulation and drug delivery system for both oral (ODF) and transdermal (skin) delivery. We believe that CUREfilm formulations can improve or match the pharmacokinetics of drugs in accordance with the desired outcome. The platform is compatible with a broad spectrum of molecules, for the formulation of both investigational and marketed prescription drugs and nutraceutical products.
 
The specific advantages below are present with multiple CUREfilm products and platform technologies. The advantages listed below are expressly described in CURE’s patent documents. Other advantages are present in specific products and platform technologies but not outlined in the patent documents and kept as trade secrets and proprietary equipment designs. Additional advantages are described in pending and unpublished patent documents.
 
 
· | Loading of multiple active ingredients on one dose unit 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Can accommodate high drug load per dose unit (e.g. > 200 mg) 
· | Quickly dissolving/disintegrating (e.g. < 2 minutes) 
· | Potential for low moisture level (e.g. < 10 wt.% water) 
· | Can achieve desired performance characteristics while maintaining pleasant feeling in the mouth (e.g. soft, plush feeling with pliable film) 
· | Can achieve desired performance characteristics while formulating active ingredients susceptible to degradation from low pH environments, light, heat, moisture, and oxygen
· | Multiple and unique ways to mask the bitter, metallic or salty taste of an active ingredient 

Intellectual Property
 
The competitive advantages of the CUREfilm platform and products over other ODF technology and products are protected by issued and ending patents, as well as trade secrets such as proprietary equipment design and manufacturing processes which allow us to produce CUREfilm products at commercial scale in a cGMP environment. We will be able to protect our technology and products from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable claims of our patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are thus an essential element of our business.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing it proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
 
We own or have exclusive rights to ten (10) issued patents, nine (9) pending applications in the United States, one (1) pending application in China and one (1) international Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent application. These patents and applications relate, among others, to (1) a method and apparatus for minimizing heat, moisture, and shear damage to medicant incorporated into an edible film, (2) edible films for administration of medicaments to animals, (3) methods for modulating dissolution, bioavailability, bioequivalence, (4) pharmaceutical composition and method of manufacturing, (5) pharmaceutical composition with ionically crosslinked polymer encapsulation of active ingredient, (6) multi-layered high dosage dissolvable film for oral administration, (7) thin films with high load of active ingredient, (8) high dosage dissolvable films for oral administration, (9) methods and composition for improving sleep, (10) oral dissolvable film that includes plant extracts and (10) rapidly disintegrating film matrix for moisture sensitive compounds.

Granted U.S. patents will expire between 2023 and 2035, excluding any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations. If issued, pending applications would expire in 2038, excluding any patent term adjustment that might be available following the grant of the patent and any patent term extensions that might be available following the grant of marketing authorizations.
 
We applied for six (6) trademark and logomark registrations, for which the opposition periods have expired without any opposition being filed.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, wellness and nutraceutical companies, as well as organizations developing advanced drug delivery platforms such as Acquestive Therapeutics, BioDelivery Sciences International, IntelGenx, ARx Pharma and LTS Lohmann which have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Furthermore, we face competition from these entities as well as universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Our success will be based in part on our ability to develop and manufacture products that address unmet medical needs and create value to patients at competitive price points. In addition, continuing to build our intellectual property portfolio and designing innovative approaches that surpass our competitors’ patents will be critical to success. 
 
CUREfilm BlueTM
 
With Pfizer’s last U.S. patents covering Viagra® expiring in 2020, we expect multiple generic sildenafil entrants worldwide. Within the lucrative erectile dysfunction (ED), our North American competitors with advanced drug delivery technology, IntelGenx Corporation and Acquestive Therapeutics are pursuing reformulation of generic Cialis®, a lower dose ED drug. There are a few companies selling Sildenafil citrate oral thin film products outside of the United States such as CTC Bio, Zim Laboratories and Seoul Pharma in Asia and IBSA Farmaceutici Italia and Sandoz in Europe. Our goal is for CUREfilm Blue to be the first Sildenafil citrate oral thin film to be approved by the FDA.
 
CUREfilm DTM
 
There are currently no Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) oral thin films on the market in the United States. Our main competitor for this product in the United States is Everidis Health Sciences’ ReplestaTM, a medical food formulated as a chewable wafer. 
 
CUREfilm SleepTM
 
While there are a few melatonin oral thin film products on the market in the United States, most do not combine multiple active ingredients. 
 
CUREfilm β-caryophylleneTM
 
There are currently no β-caryophyllene oral thin film products on the market, with most such terpenes currently being sold as liquid concentrates.
 
Recent Developments During the Year-Ended December 31, 2018
 
Registrations
 
On November 21, 2018, CURE Pharmaceutical obtained a new registration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as a manufacturer authorized to handle Schedule 1 controlled substances. With this license, the Company will develop and manufacture cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products using its CUREfilm technology, such as dronabinol-based oral thin films. Per 21 CFR § 1304.33, this registration now requires the Company to report certain acquisition and distribution activities, along with inventory and manufacturing activities, to the ARCOS Unit of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

10

 
On March 12, 2019, the Company announced its ability to handle Schedule 1 controlled substances has extended to the manufacturing of cannabis plant extracts and synthetic cannabidiol. This extended license allows CURE to take advantage of its latest U.S. Patent No. 10,238,705 for the extraction and purification of cannabis plant material, as well as subsequent processing of cannabis extracts for drug formulation.
 
Licensing Agreement
 
On September 4, 2018, we entered into its first multi-year licensing agreement (the “Licensing Agreement”) with Canopy Growth Corporation, a company that engages in the production and sale of medical cannabis (“Canopy”). Under the terms of the Licensing Agreement, Canopy will have an exclusive license to certain of the Company’s intellectual property rights, including the Company’s CUREfilm technology for use with cannabis extracts and biosynthetic cannabinoids (“Products”) and our trademarks in markets around the world where it is legal for Canopy to sell the Products, excluding Asia. We will retain the right to manufacture synthetic cannabinoids for pharmaceutical applications. Canopy will manufacture CUREfilms that deliver cannabis extracts, expanding the commercialization and monetization of the CUREfilm technology. The parties will collaborate on new products and uses for the products. Canopy shall pay to CURE approximately $250,000 for costs associated with a feasibility study and technology transfer as well as certain milestone payments and royalties on product sales by Canopy with minimum royalties starting in 2020.
 
We have successfully completed the feasibility study contemplated under the Licensing Agreement, receiving several payments in connection therewith and we are initiating the technology transfer activities as contemplated under the License Agreement.
 
Securities Purchase Agreements
 
On October 15, 2018, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with accredited investors (each an “Investor” and collectively, the “Investors”). Pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, we sold up to $2,000,000 in convertible notes (the “Notes”), initially convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”) at a conversion price equal to $2.50 at the earlier of (1) the Investor’s discretion or (2) the Company’s next bona fide sale of its preferred stock or Common Stock in excess of $4,000,000 in gross proceeds, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, which offering definitively sets a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock and results in a listing of the Company’s Common Stock on a national securities exchange. The Notes shall be issued in tranches with (1) a closing of $250,000 on October 15, 2018; (2) a closing of $250,000 on or before November 15, 2018; (3) a closing of $250,000 on or before December 1, 2018; and a closing of $1,250,000 on or before December 31, 2018.
Convertible Promissory Notes
 
From January 30, 2018 to March 28, 2018, the Company issued up to $2,025,000 convertible promissory notes with investors (“Investors”) due November 30, 2018. The notes bear interest at 9% per year and are convertible into common stock at either a price per share equal to the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of a Notice of Conversion (“Optional Conversion”) or price per share equal to 75% of the price of the Company’s next bona fide sale of its preferred stock or Common Stock in excess of $4,000,000 in gross proceeds, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, which offering definitively sets a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock or preferred stock and enables the Company to list its common stock on a national securities exchange. The Investors in this offering also received warrants (the “Warrants”) for the option to purchase equal to 50% of the shares of Common Stock that the Investor is entitled to receive in connection with the conversion of the Investor’s Note. The Warrants’ price per share shall equal the lower of (a) $2.00 or (b) 125% of the price per share of the Qualified Offering. The Warrants will have a three-year term and shall be exercisable in cash. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company repaid $275,000 of convertible promissory notes. On February 13, 2019, $750,000 of convertible promissory notes plus accrued interest and penalties of $135,825 were converted in 479,144 common stock shares of the Company. On February 15, 2019, $1,000,000 of convertible promissory notes plus accrued interest and penalties of $94,750 were converted in 591,757 common stock shares of the Company.

11

 
On April 24, 2018, we entered into a convertible promissory note totaling $500,000 due April 30, 2019, interest payable at 9% per annum; unsecured; principal and accrued interest convertible into common stock at a price per share (the “ Voluntary Conversion PPS “) equal to 75% of the average of the closing prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC Market (or any other market on which the common stock of the Company is then listed for trading) over the thirty (30) consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of the notice of conversion by the Investor to the Company, or, if at the time of such conversion the shares of the Company’s Common Stock are not listed for trading, then the entire then outstanding Investment Amount shall be converted into that number of shares of the most senior class of shares of the Company existing at the time of such conversion, at a price per share equal to 75% of the fair market value of such Common Stock as shall be determined by the Board of Directors based on, among others, a valuation prepared by an independent third party and which shall have been submitted to the Company not more than 90 days prior to the date of such determination by the Board of Directors. In the event of the consummation by the Company, on or before the Maturity Date, of a transaction or series of related transactions in which the Company issues equity securities of the Company in consideration of at least US$4,000,000 (a “Financing”), the then outstanding Investment Amount not previously converted hereunder shall be automatically converted, immediately prior to (but conditioned upon) the consummation of such Financing, into such number of shares (or a sub-class thereof) issued by the Company in the Financing, equal to the outstanding Investment Amount divided by a price per share equal to 75% of the lowest price per share paid to the Company in the Financing. In the event the Financing is not consummated by the Maturity Date, then the outstanding Investment Amount as of the Maturity Date not previously converted hereunder shall be automatically converted, on the Maturity Date, into such number of shares (or a sub-class thereof) issued by the Company in the Financing, equal to the outstanding Investment Amount divided by the Voluntary Conversion PPS.
 
Between May 18, 2018 and June 29, 2018, we entered into convertible promissory notes totaling $750,000 due December 31, 2018, interest payable at 9% per annum; secured by all assets of the company; principal and accrued interest convertible into common stock at either the price per share equal to the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of a Notice of Conversion (“Optional Conversion”) or price per share equal to 75% of the price of the Company’s next bona fide sale of its preferred stock or Common Stock in excess of $4,000,000 in gross proceeds, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, which offering definitively sets a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock or preferred stock and enables the Company to list its common stock on a national securities exchange; accrued interest to be paid quarterly beginning September 30, 2018. On July 7, 2018, a convertible promissory note of $250,000 plus accrued interest of $13,398 was converted into 297,288 common stock shares of the Company.
 
On September 27, 2018, we entered into convertible promissory notes totaling $575,000 due June 27, 2019, interest payable at 9% per annum; unsecured; principal and accrued interest convertible into common stock at either the price per share equal to the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of a Notice of Conversion (“Optional Conversion”) or price per share equal to 75% of the price of the Company’s next bona fide sale of its preferred stock or Common Stock in excess of $4,000,000 in gross proceeds, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, which offering definitively sets a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock or preferred stock and enables the Company to list its common stock on a national securities exchange; accrued interest to be paid quarterly beginning December 31, 2018. On February 13, 2019, $575,000 of convertible promissory notes plus accrued interest and penalties of $78,034 were converted in 353,221 common stock shares of the Company.
 
Between October 15, 2018 and December 3, 2018, we entered into convertible promissory notes totaling $575,000 due on October 31, 2019, interest payable at 9% per annum; unsecured; principal and accrued interest convertible into common stock at either the price per share equal to the average closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the OTC Markets for the five consecutive trading days prior to the delivery of a Notice of Conversion (“Optional Conversion”) or price per share equal to 75% of the price of the Company’s next bona fide sale of its preferred stock or Common Stock in excess of $4,000,000 in gross proceeds, in one transaction or a series of related transactions of related transactions, which offering definitely sets a price per share of the Company’s Common Stock or preferred stock and enables the Company to list its common stock on a national securities exchange; accrued interest to be paid quarterly beginning December 31, 2018, which has yet been paid.
