ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (“Novo Integrated”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2000, under the name Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. On February 20, 2008, the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. Effective July 12, 2017, the Company’s name was changed to Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. When used herein, the terms the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Novo Integrated and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Through Novo Healthnet Limited (“NHL”), our wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, we deliver multidisciplinary primary health care services and products to over 400,000 patients annually through our 16 corporate-owned clinics and a contracted network of 95 affiliate clinics and 225 eldercare centric homes located across Canada. Our team of multidisciplinary primary health care clinicians and practitioners provide assessment, diagnosis, treatment, pain management, rehabilitation, education and primary prevention for a wide array of orthopedic, musculoskeletal, sports injury, and neurological conditions across various demographics including pediatric, adult, and geriatric populations.
 
Our clinicians and practitioners provide certain multidisciplinary primary health care services, and related products, beyond the medical doctor first level contact identified as primary care. Our clinicians and practitioners are not licensed medical doctors, physicians, specialist, nurses or nurse practitioners. Our clinicians and practitioners are not authorized to practice primary care medicine and they are not medically licensed to prescribe pharmaceutical based product solutions.
 
Our specialized multidisciplinary primary health care services include physiotherapy, chiropractic care, manual/manipulative therapy, occupational therapy, eldercare, massage therapy (including pre- and post-partum), acupuncture and functional dry needling, chiropody, stroke and traumatic brain injury/neurological rehabilitation, kinesiology, vestibular therapy, concussion management and baseline testing, trauma sensitive yoga and meditation for concussion-acquired brain injury and occupational stress-PTSD, women’s pelvic health programs, sports medicine therapy, assistive devices, fall prevention education, sports team conditioning programs including event and game coverage, and private personal training,
 
Certain of the specialty treatment and recovery programs we offer derive from motor vehicle accident injuries, long-term disability cases, corporate wellness, and job-site injuries approved for treatment by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board. In addition, we offer specialized treatments and products that include cold laser therapeutics, shockwave therapy, custom bracing and orthotics, custom compression therapy/stockings and lymphatic drainage treatment.
 
Certain of our assessments and treatment technologies include Brain FX, a research based digital cognitive assessment tool measuring cognitive functional skills; and, MyndMove Therapy, a non-invasive functional electrical stimulation (FES) therapy for individuals with arm and hand paralysis due to a stroke, spinal cord or other neurological injury.
 
As we continue to build our health science platform of services and products through the integration of technology and rehabilitative science, one component of our lateral business growth strategy includes developing business units centered on the direct control of the grow, extraction, manufacturing and distribution processes regarding our hemp and medical cannabidiol products. Additionally, we continue to expand on our patient care philosophy of maintaining an on-going continuous connection with our patient community, beyond the traditional confines of a clinic, by extending oversight of patient diagnosis, care and monitoring, directly into the patient’s home, through remote patient monitoring and mobile telemedicine and diagnostic tools.

Asset Purchase Agreement with Societe Professionnelle de Physiotherapie M Dignard, carrying on business as Action Plus Physiotherapy Rockland
 
On July 22, 2019, the Company and Societe Professionnelle de Physiotherapie M Dignard, carrying on business as Action Plus Physiotherapy Rockland and providing physiotherapy and related ancillary services (“APPR”), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“APA”) pursuant to which APPR agreed to sell, assign and transfer to the Company, free and clear of all encumbrances, other than permitted encumbrances, and the Company agreed to purchase from APPR all of APPR’s right, title and interest in and to all of its assets, with the exception of certain limited exclusions, and the rights, privileges, claims and properties of any kind whatsoever that are related thereto, whether owned or leased, real or personal, tangible or intangible, of every kind and description and wheresoever situated.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the APA, the purchase price is determined as six times APPR’s purported EBITDA, equaling CAD$300,000, of which, APPR (1) received a cash payment of CAD$175,000; and (2) was issued CAD$125,000 worth of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001, as restricted common shares pursuant to an exemption from registration as set forth in Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Pursuant to the terms of the APA, APPR was issued 84,558 restricted common shares of the Company’s common stock as consideration for the CAD$125,000 payment owed to APPR. On the business day immediately preceding the closing date of the APA, determined as July 19, 2019, the CAD-to-USD conversion rate, per x-rates.com, was 0.7644 which converts CAD$125,000 to $95,550 rounded to the nearest whole number dollar amount. Based on the determined 30-trading day closing average price per share of $1.13, the calculated number of the Company’s restricted common shares issued to APPR was 84,558, which includes rounding the calculation up to the nearest whole number of shares.
 
The transaction closed on July 22, 2019. The purchase of these assets was not considered significant for accounting purposes; therefore, pro forma financial statements were not presented.

CannaPiece Group Inc. SEA Termination
 
On July 26, 2019, the Company provided CannaPiece Group Inc. (“CannaPiece”) with written confirmation for the termination of the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEA”), dated December 18, 2019, by and among the Company, NHL and CannaPiece due to the failure of CannaPiece to timely obtain approved License Producer Status under the Canada Cannabis Act, as those terms are defined in the SEA.
 
Business Growth Strategy
 
Our mission is to provide excellence in multidisciplinary primary health care assessment, diagnosis, treatment, pain management and prevention through the integration of technology and rehabilitative science. Key elements of our business growth strategy include:

● | Increase Market Share in Canada. We intend to expand our market share in Canada through strategic acquisitions of additional multidisciplinary primary health care providers and clinics in markets that we currently populate, as well as in new geographic markets. In addition, we expect to continue increasing our market share in existing eldercare services, occupational therapy services, physiotherapy services and speech language pathology services through network affiliation growth and new contract awards. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Launch our Exclusive Cannabidiol (“CBD”) Medical Cannabis Product Platform in Canada. Our platform is expected to include CBD manufacturing, sales and distribution. We expect that our CBD products will be specifically focused on CBD for use (i) as a treatment aid; (ii) to provide relief for a large array of neurological and musculoskeletal system disorders; and (iii) as an alternative option for health care providers in place of prescribing opioids to patients. Offering our patients access to non-hallucinogenic and non-addictive natural remedies, under required clinical oversight policies and procedures as they relate to medicinal cannabis and CBD, combined with our existing clinic-based treatment protocols allows us to enter this market segment with a unique integration model not readily available in the marketplace. 
● | Build an Intellectual Property Portfolio. We intend to procure, create or pursue licensing rights for Intellectual Property (IP) and patents related to health sciences and nano-formulation. When considering nano-formulation IP, one specific area we intend to pursue relates to medical cannabis related medicines, beverages and foods infused with dry powder, liquid or oil with further formulation into creams and gels, allowing for oral, intravenous and/or transdermal delivery. 
● | Expand Operations into the United States. We plan to expand operations into the U.S. through: 


○ | The introduction of a customized version of our multidisciplinary primary health care service model, with emphasis on pain prevention, treatment and management, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
○ | The strategic acquisition of targeted U.S. operating clinics in key geographical areas, 
○ | Establishment of strategic corporate alliances and partnerships with existing U.S. health care provider facilities, including certain of our current Canadian clients with U.S.-based facilities, allowing us immediate access to their client base; and 
○ | Integration of specific specialized multidisciplinary primary health care services and products that are a direct compliment to the existing primary care related products and services already provided by brand-recognized, established retail entities such as grocers, pharmacies, health fitness clinics and clinics.

● | Expand LA Fitness U.S. and LA Fitness Canada Master Facility License Agreement. Under the terms of our Agreement with LA Fitness, we will develop, open for business and operate, either through a third-party sublicense or corporate sponsored arrangement, facilities within LA Fitness U.S. and LA Fitness Canada locations which will provide outpatient physical and occupational therapy services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Introduction of “Micro-clinics” in Certain Underserved Population Clinics. We plan to leverage our expertise in the interface of technology and patient engagement to introduce our multidisciplinary primary health care services and products through “micro-clinics” located in certain underserved population clinics. Rather than relying on the traditional centralized model of bringing people to health care, our “micro-clinic” model allows for people in urban, rural and remote population clinics to have greater access and availability to a wide range of health care products and services. 
● | Develop our Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) platform in Canada and the United States. RPM provides clinicians and practitioners the ability to maintain an on-going continuous connection with their patient community, beyond the traditional confines of a clinic, extending oversight of patient care and monitoring directly into the patient’s home. Through our recently executed exclusive licensing agreement with Cloud Dx, Inc. we are expanding our offering of RPM technology to not only our Canadian clinics and affiliate clinics but to clinics throughout Canada and the United States. 
● | Develop our Virtual Physician Access System Platform (Telemedicine). We continue the development of our virtual physician access system, sometimes referred to in the industry as “telemedicine” or “virtual medicine.” Our telemedicine system intends to provide patients with real-time access to third-party primary care medically licensed physicians and specialists in various medical disciplines, in addition to providing access to multidisciplinary primary health care clinicians. Telemedicine is transforming traditional approaches to health care by providing ease of access and reduced costs for patients, particularly in areas with limited access to primary care licensed general practitioners and specialists. Our advanced telemedicine platform intends to integrate certain medical devices, such as a blood pressure reading device, a derma scope and an ophthalmoscope otoscope, each of which can provide the doctor with real-time diagnostic data, greatly enhancing the doctor’s ability to provide the patient with an accurate diagnosis. Our telemedicine platform is intended to allow any health care clinic or location to install and utilize our telemedicine platform at a relatively low-cost point of entry. 
● | Acquire Ownership Interest in Licensed Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Packaging Facilities. As we build our Intellectual Property portfolio, having ownership of a licensed high-grade pharmaceutical product manufacturing and packaging solution is integral in creating the medium for use and application of our proprietary sciences as well as mitigating market exclusion and enhancing patient services and product offerings. 
● | Expand our Posture, Stride, and Kinetic Body Movement Scanning Technologies and Protocols. When combined with decades of data harvesting and analysis, we believe these specialized technologies and protocols provide our clinics with the ability to deliver better care, early diagnosis and preventative health care strategies. 

Eldercare Centric Homes
 
We provide physiotherapy (“PT”), occupational therapy (“OT”), assessment and application assistance for assistive devices, such as walkers, wheelchairs, seating and power wheelchairs/scooters, rehabilitative strategies and continuing education to eldercare clients, to include caregivers and family members as applicable, located at various long-term care homes, retirement homes and community clients across Ontario province, Canada.
 
As a result of NHL’s September 2013 asset acquisition of Peak Health LTC Inc, formed in 2006, we have a 13-year history of providing PT services to the eldercare community. Given both PT and OT have an overlap and synchronicity of philosophies, in 2017 we added occupational therapy services for our eldercare clients.
 
Additionally, our proprietary Electronic Rehabilitation Record and Management Reporting software solution provides us the ability to provide each eldercare facility client with PT and OT reports that identify cost and optimization possibilities, a wide variety of client outcome measurements, overall contract effectiveness and much more.

Our eldercare PT services are provided as follows:
 

1. | Long-Term Care Homes. NHL contracts with long-term care homes to provide individualized onsite PT and group exercise classes for its residents. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by on-site support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are primarily funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (“MOHLTC”). The NHL team assists in providing assistive device assessments allowing residents access to funding assistance for varying mobility aids. In addition to providing PT services, our team assists the long-term care home’s interdisciplinary team, in the facilities’ annual care conferences with its residents, regarding nursing restorative programming, back education, fall prevention and many other subjects related to PT or physical health and wellness. The NHL team works together with the interdisciplinary team to assist with mandatory coding of Canada’s Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (“RAI-MDS”) which is the standardized assessment tool required for the home to access payment from the MOHLTC for each resident. Additionally, through NHL’s proprietary software, the homes have access to abundant reporting solutions to help provide objective and quantitative measures for their continuous quality improvement program. Additionally, we have been able to offer licensing rights for our proprietary software to client homes which desire to self-manage the in-facility therapy services provided to its residents. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Retirement Homes. We contract with client retirement homes to provide individualized PT and group exercise classes to the retirement homes’ residents. Registered physiotherapists are assisted by the onsite support personnel to deliver individualized care based on assessed needs. These services are partly privately funded and partly funded by the MOHLTC. Similar to the long-term care sector, our team assists with education of the nursing/interdisciplinary team and provides in depth service reports to the homes to measure desired service delivery. In addition to the services above, some of the residents in the retirement homes (or their family members) desire to have an increased level of service and opt to pay for additional private services. This is available on a fee-for-service basis and is most often in the form of individualized physiotherapy. 
3. | Home Care Physiotherapy and Community Based Exercise Classes. Throughout the province of Ontario, the MOHLTC operates 14 Local Health Integration Networks (“LHINs”) which are health authorities responsible for regional administration of public health care services. The LHINs serve as contact points, information clearinghouses, referral resources, and assessment / care coordinators for eligible residents who need health care assistance at home or a safer place to live through aging at home strategies that can be put in place by health care providers. Through service contracts, the LHINs engage “cluster providers” to provide services to clients living in the community, clients living at-home or clients living in a retirement home. These service contracts are funded by the MOHLTC. NHL is a “cluster provider” sub-contractor for home care physiotherapy and community-based exercises classes in the North East LHIN which encompasses more than 565,000 people across 400,000 square kilometers and five sub-regions. Through this subcontract arrangement, we provide one-on-one physiotherapy assessment and treatment, as well as group exercise classes to these clients who cannot easily access outpatient services due to mobility challenges. Primarily, these clients are elderly with multiple co-morbidities, although some clients are not elderly and are instead simply post-operative with mobility challenges. 
4. | Exercise & Falls Prevention. NHL is contracted with 2 “cluster providers” to provide exercise and fall prevention classes in 3 separate LHINs (Central, Toronto Central and Central East) which encompass the Greater Toronto area with an estimated aggregate population of 4.4 million people. In 2013, the MOHLTC introduced several initiatives designed to assist seniors in maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle while still living at home. Under the 2013 initiative, exercise instructors under contract with NHL deliver group exercise classes over a 48-week period each year. In addition, another component of the 2013 MOHLTC initiative is the delivery of fall prevention classes taught by specialized registered providers such as kinesiologists and physiotherapists with the assistance of exercise instructors. The goal of these classes is to assess seniors’ general health status, identify defined levels of risk pertaining to balance and falling, and educate seniors about fall prevention through a combination of increased knowledge and teaching exercises designed to improve strength and balance.

5. | Community-based Outpatient Clinics. NHL provides outpatient physiotherapy, chiropractic and laser technology services through one community-based clinic in Ontario province. A portion of the services provided at the clinic is funded by the MOHLTC. The remainder of our services provided at the clinic is funded by MVA treatment plans, extended health benefits insurance coverage, or private payment. These services are specifically targeted to be delivered to clients who meet the following criteria: 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aged 65 years of age and older or aged 18 years of age and younger, and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Are post-operative, or 
● | Have just been discharged from a hospital, or 
● | Are receiving services from the Ontario Disability Services Program or Ontario Works. 

 
Our eldercare OT services are provided, through 2 separate sectors, as follows:
 

1. | Long-Term Care Sector. We contract with client homes to provide the following OT services: 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Assessments and interventions to support maintenance and restoration of function related to seating, mobility, positioning for self-care, prevention of pressure ulcers, falls and use of restraints, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Speech language pathology services, including evaluation and treatment, 
● | Swallowing and eating assessments and interventions, 
● | Cognitive behavioral assessments and care planning, 
● | Our occupational therapists have specialized training in mobility providing assistive device assessments when required. This service is funded primarily by the MOHLTC. 


2. | Retirement Home & Community. We provide the following OT services through individual contracts with private payers: 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Home safety assessments, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Functional assessments, 
● | In-home activities of daily living assessments, 
● | Assessment and completion of applications for assistive devices (mobility aids), 
● | Custom seating and mobility consultations, 
● | Case management services, and 
● | Speech language pathology services, including evaluation and treatment. 

About Our Affiliate Clinics
 
In order to strengthen our position within the Canadian Preferred Provider Network (“PPN”), we’ve built a contracted affiliate relationship with 95 clinics across Canada with 79 affiliate clinics in Ontario province and 16 affiliate clinics located throughout Alberta, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.
 
The PPN is a network of three major insurance companies and their subsidiaries, totaling 11 insurance companies. PPN member insurance companies, in need of specific multidisciplinary primary health care solutions for their patients, send referrals to specific clinics registered through the PPN. We, as one of five major providers to the PPN, receive referrals through the PPN. This subset of business is a continuous source of referrals, from the insurance company payer to the approved group of clinics meeting the insurance companies’ pre-determined set of criteria for what they believe to be an appropriate clinical setting. Affiliate clinics pay us a mix of a flat fee and a percentage-based fee upon receipt of a payment for a service referred through the PPN.
 
The services provided by our affiliate clinics are consistent with the multidisciplinary primary health care services provided by our own corporate clinics. While each affiliate clinic may provide additional unique health care solutions, all affiliate clinics must meet specific criteria established under the PPN, creating a single standard of excellence across all clinics within our network.

Cloud Dx
 
On February 26, 2019, the Company completed a Software License Agreement with Cloud DX, Inc., a medical device company, operating in the United States and Canada that develops both hardware and related software for Remote Patient Monitoring and Chronic Care, that provides NHL with perpetual licensing rights to the Bundled Pulsewave PAD-1A USB Blood Pressure Device, related software and up-to-date product releases. Additionally, the License Agreement provides NHL with conditional exclusive rights, over the initial 5-year period, to sub-license and re-sell Bundled Pulsewave Devices and related software.
 
The Cloud Dx platform allows NHL to further expand on its patient care philosophy of maintaining an on-going continuous connection with its patient community, beyond the traditional confines of a clinic, extending oversight of patient care and monitoring directly into the patient’s home through Remote Patient Monitoring (“RPM”). The Cloud DX technology empowers a patient with real-time vital sign information while maintaining a direct technology link from patient to clinician or medical practitioner. The transfer of vital information from home to clinic or patient to clinician further allows our clinicians and practitioners to deliver non-redundant diagnostic based proactive multidisciplinary primary health care.
 
Contracts
 
Certain contracts held with client homes and client companies follow standard formats and include generally accepted terms of reference. Specific clauses within the NHL contracts for services contain language intended to (1) clarify which entity is the health information custodian of the medical files (usually held by the client home or company), (2) define release of liability, (3) ensure privacy and confidentiality of proprietary information or private health information, (4) define provisions of worker’s compensation clearance or benefits for employees and/or contractors, (5) detail provisions of value-added items, services or programs, (6) set out terms and conditions of the contract (often for a set number of years with an option to a renew), (7) provide for termination conditions, and (8) detail invoicing and billing procedures.
Employees
 
As of August 31, 2019, we employ 70 full-time employees. Approximately 85% of our clinicians and practitioners are contracted as independent contractors. We believe that we maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees and have not experienced any labor disputes.
Competition
 
Other Multidisciplinary Primary Health Care Providers
 
In Canada, the specialized multidisciplinary primary health care service sector in which we operate is highly competitive. With a finite number of patients and corporate clients, companies providing multidisciplinary primary health care services operate within an overlapping patient and client landscape.
 
Our business growth strategy includes expanding our patient base through both opening new clinics and the acquisition of existing multidisciplinary primary health care providers and clinics in markets that we currently populate, as well as in new geographic markets, including the United States. There is additional competition from non-traditional health care providers, such as holistic and Eastern medicine-based clinics. We believe that we can successfully compete based on our large service offerings, competitive pricing, solid reputation and our clinicians’ devotion to maintaining high quality care and patient satisfaction.
 
Health Insurance Plans
 
Additionally, our ability to effectively compete for patients is impacted by commercial and managed care payor programs that influence patient choice by offering health insurance plans that restrict patient choice of provider.

Canadian Health Care System
 
Our competition will also be the Canadian health care system which is a government sponsored system that began in 1957, when Parliament approved the Hospital Insurance and Diagnostics Services Act. The Act provided free acute hospital care, laboratory and radiological diagnostic services to Canadians. By 1961, agreements were in place with all the provinces and 99% of Canadians had free access to the health care services covered by the legislation. The Act was followed by the Medical Care Act of 1966 that provided free access to physician services. By 1972, each province had established its own system of free access to physician services. The federal government shared in the funding. In 1984, the Government of Canada passed the Canada Health Act (CHA). The Canada Health Act created a publicly administered health care system that is comprehensive, universal and accessible. All medically necessary procedures are provided free of charge. The system provides diagnostic, treatment and preventive services regardless of income level or station in life. Access to care is not based on health status or ability to pay. Coverage is portable between provinces and territories. We can give no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete in this market.
Government Regulation and Health Care Regulation
 
Canada
 
In Canada, some health care services are public, some are private and there are a number of different entities involved in regulating and providing their delivery. While there is a perception that all health care in Canada is publicly funded, the publicly funded system is generally restricted to “medically necessary” hospital and physician services, and provincial or territorial drug plans that provide access to prescription drugs to residents over the age of 65 or those residents who rely on social assistance programs. Publicly funded services are delivered through a combination of public and private providers and funding comes from the Canadian federal government, which sets national standards, and the provincial and territorial governments, which regulates the delivery of services and determines those services that are deemed “medically necessary” (i.e., publicly funded) within the context of their own unique fiscal and political environment. In addition, there are a wide array of health products and services that are not subject to coverage under the public health insurance plans that are provided on a private payer basis. See “Risks Related to our Multidisciplinary Primary Health Care Business”.
 
Federal/Provincial Government Division of Power
 
As is the case for many important industries and economic sectors, neither the federal, nor the provincial/territorial level of government has exclusive jurisdiction over health. Instead, the Constitution Act, 1867, divides the legislative powers relevant to the regulation of the delivery of health products and services between the federal and provincial levels of government.
 
The federal government is responsible for regulating important aspects of various health industries or sectors including the regulation of selling, importing, distributing and marketing of drugs and medical devices and maintains significant influence over health policy and national objectives through the use of its spending power.
 
The provincial/territorial level of government has comprehensive authority over the delivery of health care services. Other examples of provincial responsibility include the regulation of hospitals and other health facilities, administration of health insurance plans, distribution of prescription drugs and regulation of health professionals.
 
However, many health industry sectors are subject to at least some degree of regulation or oversight by both levels of government.
 
Canada’s National Health Insurance Program
 
Canada’s “national” health insurance program, a publicly funded single-payer system often referred to as “Medicare,” is designed to ensure that all Canadian residents have universal access to medically necessary hospital and physician services through the provincial and territorial health care insurance plans.

The Canada Health Act
 
The Canada Health Act is the federal legislation that provides the foundation for the Canadian health care system. The Act is administered by Health Canada, the federal department with primary responsibility for maintaining and improving the health of Canadians. However, neither the Canada Health Act nor Health Canada have direct authority to regulate the health insurance plans that give effect to the publicly funded health insurance system that is in place across the country. Instead, the Act establishes certain values and principles and sets out criteria and conditions that each publicly funded health insurance plan is required to meet in order to qualify for federal funding through the Canada Health Transfer. As federal funding is critical to the ability to fund “medically necessary” hospital and physician services, each provincial and territorial health insurance plan must satisfy the requirements of public administration; universality; portability; comprehensiveness; and accessibility.
 
Notably, these requirements relate only to funding and administration and establish broad principles rather than a prescriptive code. In addition, the Canada Health Act is silent with respect to the delivery of health services and does not prohibit or discourage the delivery of insured health services by the private sector. As a result, there is significant variation in the funding and administration of health insurance plans from one jurisdiction to another. However, most provinces permit the delivery of a broad range of publicly funded health services through a combination of both public and private providers. Indeed, many publicly funded services in Canada are privately delivered.
 
The requirement that publicly funded health insurance plans be comprehensive requires that “medically necessary” hospital and physician services be covered. If a service is determined to be “medically necessary” then the full cost of the service must be covered by the public plan. However, the term is not defined and the services that must be covered are intentionally and broadly defined in order to accommodate the ability of each province and territory to make its own coverage decisions within the context of its unique fiscal and political environment. Typically, such decisions are made in consultation with the relevant medical associations in the jurisdiction. However, determining whether a particular service is “medical necessary” is a determination that has both a fiscal and political dimension. Ultimately, these coverage decisions are decisions about the allocation of scarce public resources.
 
The products and services available to Canadians through the publicly funded health insurance system are supplemented by a wide array of health products and services that are not, as a general matter, subject to coverage under the public health insurance plans. For example, prescription drug coverage, dental services and vision care are generally provided on a private payer basis. However, many jurisdictions provide coverage for these types of services to seniors and those who face financial or other barriers to privately funded health care. There are also a growing number of providers offering non-medically necessary and other ancillary health services. Examples include elective surgical or cosmetic procedures.
 
Regulation of Health Professionals and Health Facilities
 
Health professionals and health care facilities are subject to federal laws of general application, but the regulation of such matters is largely a matter of provincial jurisdiction.
Health Professionals
 
Through legislation, the provinces have delegated the regulation of health professionals to self-governing professional bodies (with varying degrees of discretion). Such legislation generally seeks to protect the public through a combination of “input regulations” that focus on who is entitled to provide a particular health service and “output regulations” that focus on the quality and delivery of the service being provided. Such regulations also generally include conflict of interest (or anti-kickback) provisions, as such matters are generally dealt with as part of the regulation of health professions rather than the regulation of health facilities.
 
Health industry participants offering a particular service need to understand how the service is regulated. If the service involves the performance of a regulated or controlled act (i.e., acts that can only be performed by a particular category or categories of regulated health professionals or their delegates) then the involvement of one or more duly qualified health professionals will likely be required. Also, it may be necessary to implement certain protocols and procedures in order to comply with the requirements of the regulatory colleges that govern the practices of any such professionals. Complying with such requirements can have significant commercial implications.
 
Health facilities
 
Operating a regulated health facility can be challenging and often involves a degree of regulatory risk.

--


Residential health care facilities other than hospitals, such as nursing homes, long-term care facilities, pharmacies, laboratories and specimen collection clinics are, in most jurisdictions, privately owned and operated pursuant to provincial licenses and oversight. However, the degree to which such health facilities and other providers are regulated generally depends on the nature of the products and services being provided.
 
The operation of health facilities by private sector entities still typically involves some element of reimbursement through public funds. Where public funds are being used to acquire goods and services, additional accountability measures such as procurement requirements often apply.
 
Regulation of Drugs
 
The process of obtaining marketing authorizations and approvals of prescription drugs is administered by Health Canada’s Therapeutic Products Directorate (“TPD”).
 
The TPD applies the Food and Drugs Act and the regulations applicable to prescription drugs to ensure that drug products sold in Canada are safe and effective. No drug product can be offered for sale in Canada unless and until, after review, it is issued a marketing authorization by Health Canada.
 
In addition to its review of drug products, Health Canada is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of drug products being sold in Canada, as well as the regulation of good manufacturing practices and establishment licenses, which are required in connection with the import, manufacture, distribution and/or sale of drug products.
 
The Patented Medicines Prices Review Board
 
The Patented Medicines Prices Review Board (“PMPRB”) is an independent quasi-judicial body created in 1987 under amendments to the Patent Act. The PMPRB is responsible for regulating the prices that patentees charge for prescription and non-prescription patented drugs sold in Canada. Based on a review of the information required to be filed by a patentee, the PMPRB considers whether the price of a medicine appears excessive based on certain factors including: (i) the prices that the patented medicine is sold in the Canadian market; (ii) the prices at which other medicines in the same therapeutic class are sold in the Canadian market; and (iii) the prices at which the medicine and other medicines in the same therapeutic class have been sold in other countries other than Canada. If the PMPRB considers the price of a medicine appears excessive, revised pricing is the usual outcome.
Public Market access
 
Each province has a provincial drug plan that allows certain individuals to access drugs at a reduced cost. Products that will be paid for by the provincial government (in some provinces, for all residents, while in others for certain prescribed individuals such as seniors and individuals receiving social assistance), are typically listed on provincial formularies. For innovator products, the manufacturer negotiates the pricing for inclusion on the provincial formulary with the provincial government. For generic products, the price to be paid for the generic product is determined by a sliding scale of fixed prices related to when such products enter the market and the price of the innovator product (i.e., a percent of the price of the innovator pharmaceutical product depending on whether they are first, second or third entry products). If a drug is a generic product and listed as interchangeable on the provincial formulary, a pharmacist is permitted to dispense the interchangeable product for the innovator product. Under most provincial benefit plans, interchanging a generic product for the innovator product by pharmacists is mandatory and generally most provinces will only reimburse the pharmacist for the lowest cost interchangeable product. Government drug plans account for approximately 50% of all sales of prescription drugs in Canada.
 
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to constant change. Federal and provincial enforcement entities have significantly increased their scrutiny of health care companies and providers which has led to investigations, prosecutions, convictions and large settlements. Although we conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and provincial fraud and abuse laws, many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted with any certainty. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or that they will be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Further, responding to investigations can be time consuming and result in significant legal fees and can potentially divert management’s attention from the Company.

Client Information Privacy
 
In Canada, under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and under various provincial laws, comprehensive privacy laws have been introduced to protect the privacy of individuals from the undisclosed or non-consensual sharing of sensitive information for commercial purposes. As the gathering and use of information is such an integral component of our business, we must always be alert for and respond to changes in the information regulatory environment.
Protection of Environment and Human Health and Safety
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Some of our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We also plan to acquire ownership in new facilities and properties, some of which may have had a history of commercial or other operations. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, abutters or other persons, and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil penalties or fines.
United States
 
The United States health care industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governments. Government regulation affects our businesses in several ways, including requiring licensure or certification of facilities, regulating billing and payment for certain of our services, regulating how we maintain health-related information and patient privacy, and regulating how we pay and contract with our physicians. Our ability to conduct our business and to operate profitability depends in part upon obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses and other approvals; and complying with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation.”
State Law Regulation of Construction, Acquisition or Expansion of Healthcare Facilities
 
Thirty-six states have certificate of need programs that require some level of prior approval for the construction of a new facility, acquisition or expansion of an existing facility, or the addition of new services at various healthcare facilities. Following the acquisition of one or more clinics or staffing primary healthcare practitioners in the United States, states where we may seek to operate may require a certificate of need to acquire or operate our clinics.
State Licensure
 
Only a few states may require the licensure of multidimensional primary health care clinics and clinics such as ours. This absence of a uniform licensing process leads to inconsistencies in the nature and scope of services offered at our care clinics. To effectively control the nature of services rendered and the environments in which they are offered, state legislators or regulators may attempt to regulate the urgent care industry in a manner similar to hospitals and freestanding emergency rooms. Following the acquisition of one or more clinics or staffing primary healthcare practitioners in the United States, such regulations could have a material impact on our growth strategy and expansion plans.
Laws and Rules Regarding Billing
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, numerous state and federal laws may apply to our claims for payment, including but not limited to (i) “coordination of benefits” rules that dictate which payor must be billed first when a patient has coverage from multiple payors, (ii) requirements that overpayments be refunded within a specified period of time, (iii) “reassignment” rules governing the ability to bill and collect professional fees on behalf of other providers, (iv) requirements that electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats, and (v) laws requiring all health and financial information of patients in a manner that complies with applicable security and privacy standards.

Additionally, on January 16, 2009, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), released the final rule (implemented on October 1, 2015) mandating that providers covered by the Administrative Simplification Provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), including our clinics, comply with ICD-10. Following the acquisition of one or more clinics or staffing primary healthcare practitioners in the United States, we will incur additional compliance related costs.
 
Medicare and Medicaid
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, our clinics and multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinicians and practitioners, including any staffing we might pursue in affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes in the United States, might participate in the federal Medicare and/or Medicaid programs.
 
Since 1992, Medicare has paid for the “medically necessary” services of physicians, non-physician practitioners, clinicians and certain other suppliers under a physician fee schedule, a system that pays for covered physicians’ services furnished to a person with Medicare Part B coverage. Under the physician fee schedule, relative values are assigned to each of more than 7,000 services to reflect the amount of work, the direct and indirect (overhead) practice expenses, and the malpractice expenses typically involved in furnishing that service. Each of these three relative value components is multiplied by a geographic adjustment factor to adjust the payment for variations in the costs of furnishing services in different localities. Relative value units, or RVUs, are summed for each service and then are multiplied by a fixed-dollar conversion factor to establish the payment amount for each service. The higher the number of RVUs assigned to a service, the higher the payment. Under the Medicare fee-for-service payment system, an individual can choose any licensed physician enrolled in Medicare and use the services of any healthcare provider or facility certified by Medicare.
 
On November 2, 2017, the Clinics for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a final rule updating the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”) under the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”). MACRA was signed into law on April 16, 2015, ending the Sustained Growth Rate (“SGR”) formula for determining Medicare spending on physician services. MACRA created two provider payment tracks—the Medicare Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) and the Advanced Alternative Payment Models (“A-APM”) track. Under MIPS, clinicians receive an annual composite score, which drives either an upward or downward rate adjustment two years after the performance period. Under the A-APM track, participants in Medicare Alternative Payment Models that exceed specified levels of clinician risk become MIPS-exempt and receive special bonuses equivalent to 5% of their annual Part B revenue. MACRA requirements on clinicians are already in effect for calendar year 2017, with payment adjustments under the new system due to start in 2019. However, in rulemaking last year, CMS significantly scaled back MIPS requirements for Performance Year 2017 to address concerns about physician buy-in and participation. Under the Final Rule, CMS would continue this “go slow” trajectory for MIPS, notably by increasing MIPS exemptions and once again scaling back potential downside payment adjustments through design of the MIPS scoring system. Reductions in Medicare payments could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
CMS’s RAC Program
 
The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) introduced on a trial basis the use of Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) for the purpose of identifying and recouping Medicare overpayments and underpayments. Any overpayment received from Medicare is considered a debt owed to the federal government. In October 2008, CMS made the RAC program permanent. RACs review Medicare claims to determine whether such claims were appropriately reimbursed by Medicare. RACs engage in an automated review and in a complex review of claims. Automated reviews are conducted when a review of the medical record is not required and there is certainty that the service is not covered or is coded incorrectly. Complex reviews involve the review of all underlying medical records supporting the claim and are generally conducted where there is a high likelihood, but not certainty, that an overpayment has occurred. RACs are paid a contingency fee based on overpayments they identified and collected.
 

15
--


A Medicare administrative contractor, or MAC, may suspend Medicare payments to a provider if it determines that an overpayment has occurred. When a Medicare claim for payment is filed, the MAC will notify the patient and the provider of its initial determination regarding reimbursement. The MAC may deny the claim for one of several reasons, including the lack of necessary information or lack of medical necessity for the services rendered. Providers may appeal any denials for claim payment.
 
Anti-Kickback Statute
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, if we are participants in the Medicare program, we will be subject to the Anti-kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. The ACA amended the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violation the statute. Further, the ACA now provides that claims submitted in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (“FCA”) including the failure to timely return an overpayment. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services reimbursed by a governmental health program or state Medicaid program. Some of these state prohibitions apply to remuneration for referrals of healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial payors.
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, if we accept funds from governmental health programs, we will be subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, such as $25,000 per violation and up to three times the remuneration involved. If in violation, we may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims, and may also require entry into a corporate integrity agreement, or CIA. Any such sanctions or obligations contained in a CIA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
False Claims Act
 
The federal civil FCA prohibits providers from, among other things, (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payments from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent; (2) knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the federal government; or (3) knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The “qui tam” or “whistleblower” provisions of the FCA allow private individuals to bring actions under the FCA on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of “whistleblower” lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Defendants found to be liable under the FCA may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim.
 
There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. The government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. The ACA also provides that claims submitted in connection with patient referrals that results from violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false claims for the purpose of the FCA with some courts determining that a violation of the Stark law can result in FCA liability as well. In addition, a number of states have adopted their own false claims and whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. Following the acquisition of one or more clinics or staffing primary healthcare practitioners in the United States, we will be required to provide information to our employees and certain contractors about state and federal false claims laws and whistleblower provisions and protections.

Civil Monetary Penalties Statute
 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties statute prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider or supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state healthcare program.
Electronic Health Records
 
As required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Secretary of HHS has developed and implemented an incentive payment program for eligible healthcare professionals that adopt and meaningfully use electronic health record, or EHR, technology. HHS uses the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System, or PECOS, to verify Medicare enrollment prior to making EHR incentive program payments. If our employed professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, healthcare professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. System conversions to comply with EHR could be time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees. Failure to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, we will convert certain of our clinical and patient accounting information system applications to newer versions of existing applications or altogether new applications. In connection with our implementation and conversions, we will likely incur capitalized costs and additional training and implementation expenses.
 
Privacy and Security Requirements of Our Business Lines
 
Following the intended acquisition, or opening, of one or more multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics or the staffing of multidisciplinary primary healthcare clinics, affiliate clinics or eldercare centric homes with clinicians and practitioners in the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, as amended (“HITECH”) will govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information. As required by HIPAA, HHS has adopted standards to protect the privacy and security of this health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the grant of certain rights to patients with respect to such information by “covered entities.” We believe that all or substantially all of our entities qualify as covered entities under HIPAA. We will take actions to comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations including the creation and implementation of policies and procedures, staff training, execution of HIPAA-compliant contractual arrangements with certain service providers and various other measures. Although we believe we will be in substantial compliance, ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time, effort and expense.
 
In addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health-related information received, maintained, or transmitted by covered entities or their business associates. Although we have taken actions in an effort to be in compliance with these security regulations, a security incident that bypasses our information security systems causing an information security breach, loss of PHI, or other data subject to privacy laws or a material disruption of our operational systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, along with fines. Furthermore, ongoing implementation and oversight of these security measures involves significant time, effort and expense.

Further, HITECH, as implemented in part by an omnibus final rule published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2013, further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information, or PHI, that compromises the privacy or security of such information. HHS has established the presumption that all unauthorized uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI constitute breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes there is a low probability that the information has been compromised. HITECH and implementing regulations specify that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more must be reported immediately to HHS, which will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Furthermore, breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS of such breaches at least annually. These breach notification requirements apply not only to unauthorized disclosures of unsecured PHI to outside third parties but also to unauthorized internal access to or use of such PHI.
 
The scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA was substantially expanded by HITECH, which also increased penalties for violations. Penalties for violations of these laws vary. For instance, penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly, and include significant civil monetary penalties and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. In addition, numerous breach incidents could lead to possible penalties in excess of $1.68 million. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one-year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. The amount of penalty that may be assessed depends, in part, upon the culpability of the applicable covered entity or business associate in committing the violation. Some penalties for certain violations that were not due to “willful neglect” may be waived by the Secretary of HHS in whole or in part, to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be excessive relative to the violation. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of residents of their states. Applicable courts may be able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. HITECH also mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of a cross-section of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. Every covered entity and business associate is subject to being audited, regardless of the entity’s compliance record.
 
State laws may impose more protective privacy restrictions related to health information and may afford individuals a private right of action with respect to the violation of such laws. Both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy protection at any time. We are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional requirements on us and more severe penalties for disclosures of health information. If we fail to comply with HIPAA, similar state laws or any new laws, including laws addressing data confidentiality, security or breach notification, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and substantial damage to our reputation.
 
States may also impose restrictions related to the confidentiality of personal information that is not considered PHI under HIPAA, including certain identifying information and financial information of our patients. Theses state laws may impose additional notification requirements in the event of a breach of such personal information. Failure to comply with such data confidentiality, security and breach notification laws may result in substantial monetary penalties.
 
HIPAA and HITECH also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility and payment information. Covered entities such as the Company and each of our clinics will be required to conform to such transaction set standards.

Virtual Physician Access System Platform, Remote Patient Monitoring Platform and E-Commerce
 
Our Virtual Physician Access System platform (“telemedicine” or “telemedicine platform”) which is currently under development, once operational is subject to governmental health care regulations in Canada (including, but not limited to, the Canada Health Act) and the United States (including, but not limited to, for purposes of the United States laws, Medicare, Medicaid, RAC, Anti-Kick Back Statute, False Claims Act, Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, HIPAA, and HITECH) set forth above. In addition, we will be subject to data privacy, security and breach notification requirements of both Canadian and United States federal statutes and other data privacy and security laws.
Remote Patient Monitoring Platform
 
Our Remote Patient Monitoring platform (“RPM” or RPM platform”), which is currently in development, collects and transmits a patient’s personal data and vital statistics, and is subject to both governmental health care regulations and data privacy, security and breach notification requirements of both Canadian and United States federal statutes and other data privacy and security laws.
Stark Law
 
Our telemedicine platform, which is currently under development, once operational will provide patients with real-time access to third-party primary care medically licensed physicians, specialists, nurses and nurse practitioners in various medical disciplines as well as multidisciplinary primary care clinicians. Because we will participate through our telemedicine platform in the Medicare program, we will also be subject to the Stark Law. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the “designated health services”. Further, the Stark Law has application to the Company’s management contracts with individual physicians, physician groups, multidisciplinary primary care clinicians, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, specialists, nurses and nurse practitioners in various medical disciplines as well as multidisciplinary primary care clinicians, including any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws like the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in operating our telemedicine and RPM platform and believe that our operations are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 
E-Commerce
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and provincial regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the use of the Internet, availability of economic broadband access, or other online services, and increase the cost of providing our digital delivery of content and services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws which govern issues such as property ownership, sales, use and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business and results of operations.
 
Medical Cannabidiol Product
 
As discussed above, we plan on expanding our business to include the cultivation and production of hemp in Canada, cannabidiol (“CBD”) manufacturing in Canada and CBD sales and distribution in Canada and United States. We expect that our CBD products will be specifically focused on CBD for use (i) as a treatment aid; (ii) to provide relief for a large array of neurological and musculoskeletal system disorders; and (iii) as an alternative option for health care providers in place of prescribing opioids to patients. Offering our patients access to non-hallucinogenic and non-addictive natural remedies, under required clinical oversight policies and procedures as they relate to medicinal cannabis and CBD, combined with our existing clinic-based treatment protocols allows us to enter this market segment with a unique integration model not readily available in the market.

Cannabis versus Hemp
 
While hemp and cannabis are both derived from the same species (Cannabis sativa), there are major differences in the characteristics of the respective plant strains that produce industrial hemp on the one hand, and cannabis products on the other. In short, hemp is a strain of the Cannabis sativa plant that is grown primarily for use in industrial applications. It has been specifically cultivated to produce a low tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”) content and a high cannabidiol (“CBD”) content. THC is the psychoactive constituent of cannabis and is responsible for producing the effects of the drug. CBD is another active ingredient present in Cannabis sativa plants, and it largely acts to neutralize the psychoactive effects of THC. Since hemp strains have very little THC and a lot of CBD, they do not produce psychoactive effects when ingested.
Canada
 
Cannabis is legal in Canada for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Medicinal use of cannabis was legalized nationwide on July 30, 2001 under conditions outlined in the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations, later superseded by the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations, issued by Health Canada and seed, grain, and fiber production was permitted under license by Health Canada. The federal Cannabis Act came into effect on October 17, 2018 and made Canada the second country in the world to formally legalize the cultivation, possession, acquisition and consumption of cannabis and its by-products.
 
As set out in the Cannabis Regulations:

Under the new regulations, there are improvements for patients accessing cannabis for medical purposes from federally licensed sellers. These improvements include:
 

● | the ability to request the return of their medical document from a federally licensed seller 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the ability to request the transfer of their medical document to a different federally licensed seller 
● | that the effective date on the registration document will be the day it is issued, rather than the day the medical document was signed by the health care provider 
● | removal of the 30-day limitation period for buying cannabis from a federally licensed seller (to ensure no break in a patient’s supply) 
● | a broader range of permitted products 
● | access to an increasing number of licensed producers and sellers (Health Canada has licensed more producers in the last year than in the 4 previous years combined). The increasing number of licensed producers enables: 


○ | competitive prices

○ | more supply of cannabis 
○ | an increased availability of a range of products 

United States
 
Until 2014, when 7 U.S. Code §5940 became federal law as part of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Act”), products containing oils derived from hemp, notwithstanding a minimal or non-existing THC content, were classified as Schedule I illegal drugs. The 2014 Farm Act expired on September 30, 2018, and was thereafter replaced by the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 on December 20, 2018 (the “2018 Farm Act “), which amended various sections of the U.S. Code, thereby removing hemp, defined as cannabis with less than 0.3% of THC, from Schedule 1 status under the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), and legalizing the cultivation and sale of hemp at the federal level, subject to compliance with certain federal requirements and state law, amongst other things. THC is the psychoactive component of plants in the cannabis family generally identified as marihuana or marijuana. We anticipate that our medical CBD products will be federally legal in the United States in that they will contain less than 0.3% of THC in compliance with the 2018 Farm Bill guidelines and will have no psychoactive effects on our patients’ and customers’ bodies. Notwithstanding, there is no assurance that the 2018 Farm Act will not be repealed or amended such that our products containing hemp-derived CBD would once again be deemed illegal under federal law.
 
The 2018 Farm Bill also shifted regulatory authority from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Agriculture. The 2018 Farm Bill did not change the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) oversight authority over CBD products. The 2018 Farm Act delegated the authority to the states to regulate and limit the production of hemp and hemp derived products within their territories. Although many states have adopted laws and regulations that allow for the production and sale of hemp and hemp derived products under certain circumstances, no assurance can be given that such state laws may not be repealed or amended such that our intended products containing hemp-derived CBD would once again be deemed illegal under the laws of one or more states now permitting such products, which in turn would render such intended products illegal in those states under federal law even if the federal law is unchanged. In the event of either repeal of federal or of state laws and regulations, or of amendments thereto that are adverse to our intended medical CBD products, we may be restricted or limited with respect to those products that we may sell or distribute, which could adversely impact our intended business plan with respect to such intended products.
 
Additionally, the FDA has indicated its view that certain types of products containing CBD may not be permissible under the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). The FDA’s position is related to its approval of Epidiolex, a marijuana-derived prescription medicine to be available in the United States. The active ingredient in Epidiolex is CBD. On December 20, 2018, after the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement in which he reiterated the FDA’s position that, among other things, the FDA requires a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, to be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce and that the FDCA prohibits introducing into interstate commerce food products containing added CBD, and marketing products containing CBD as a dietary supplement, regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived. Although we believe our existing and planned CBD product offerings comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, legal proceedings alleging violations of such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We do not intend to offer and we do not compete with companies that offer cannabis products containing high levels of psychoactive THC. Although legal in some states, and in Canada, we do not intend to enter into this market. We may offer our medical CBD (hemp-based) products to patients and customers but will not compete with any medical or recreational marijuana sellers of products for high THC content sales due to legal and regulatory restrictions and uncertainty in the United States. Because of regulatory challenges facing marijuana companies in the United States, the vast majority of the companies focused on THC are Canadian and foreign, although several have begun to pursue domestic activities in states that permit marijuana sales. Federal law does not generally recognize marijuana (or hemp that exceeds 0.3% THC) as lawful, although that may change in the future.
