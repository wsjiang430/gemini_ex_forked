ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Business Overview
 
Muscle Maker, Inc. (referred to herein as “MMI” or “Company”), was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on October 25, 2019. The principal corporate office of MMI is located at 1751 River Run, Suite 200, Fort Worth, Texas, 76107, and the telephone number at that location is (832) 604-9568. Our website address is https://www.ir.musclemakergrill.com.
 
MMI together with its subsidiaries, is referred to in this Form 10-K annual report (“Form 10-K”) as the Company. The terms “we”, “us” and “our” are also used in the Form 10-K to refer to the Company. Throughout the Form 10-K, the terms “restaurants”, “stores”, “eatery” and “locations” are used inter changeably. While MMI, as the parent Company, does not directly own or operate any restaurants throughout this document we may refer to restaurants that are owned or operated by our subsidiaries as being Company-owned.
 
MMI is our parent company. Through our subsidiaries, we operate within the global food-supply chain, in an effort to integrate capabilities and create a sustainable and innovative company, that enhances the social, environmental and financial value to our Company. We own and operate three unique “healthier for you” restaurant concepts within our portfolio of companies: Muscle Maker Grill restaurants, SuperFit Foods meal prep and Pokemoto Hawaiian Poke restaurants (“Restaurant Division”). Our Company was founded on the belief of taking every-day menu options and converting them into “healthier for you” menu choices. Consumers are demanding healthier choices, customization, flavor and convenience. We believe our portfolio of companies directly satisfy these consumer needs. We focus on lean proteins, fresh fruits and vegetables, proprietary sauces, whole grains and various other items like protein shakes, meal plans, specialty drinks and super foods. Each of our three concepts offers different menus that are tailored to specific consumer segments. We operate in the fast-casual and meal prep segments of the restaurant industry. We believe our “healthier for you” inspired concepts deliver a highly differentiated customer experience.
 
We also own and operate Sadot LLC (“Sadot”), a wholesaling food business, which engages in the purchase and sale of physical food commodities. The goal of Sadot is to launch Muscle Maker into a new era by creating a comprehensive, global food company that stretches from sustainable farming, agricultural commodity shipping and trading, distribution, productions and ultimately reaches consumers through the restaurant, franchise and meal prep companies.
 
Muscle Maker Grill Restaurants (“Muscle Maker Grill”): our Muscle Maker Grill restaurants are fast-casual style restaurants specializing in “healthier for you” high quality, made to order, lean protein-based meals. These meals feature all-natural chicken breast, grass fed beef, lean turkey, shrimp and plant-based items. We pair these lean proteins with super foods such as avocado, quinoa, spinach, kale and broccoli, while also offering cauliflower rice, whole wheat pasta, sweet potato fries and proprietary specialty sauces like zero carb, fat free or gluten free options. Our products are made to order. The menu features bowls, wraps, salads and burgers. We also offer protein shakes and fruit smoothies along with meal plans and catering. Customers can dine in or take out or have their meals delivered to their door via Company delivery personnel or third-party services such as Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub.
 
SuperFit Foods Meal Prep (“SuperFit Foods”): On March 25, 2021, we acquired the assets of SuperFit Foods. SuperFit Foods is a wholly owned meal prep division located in Jacksonville, Florida and focuses solely on meal plans. The terms meal prep and meal plans will be used interchangeably throughout this document. The business operates with a centralized kitchen that prepares all meals for distribution to consumers twice per week. This is a subscription-based business model where consumers order their meals via the SuperFitfoods.com website and are charged automatically every week. There are over 150 meal plan options to choose from as well as various healthy juices, snacks and desserts. Meal plans focus on specific dietary needs such as vegetarian, high protein, gluten free and low calorie.
 
SuperFit Foods’ distribution process is different than most meal prep companies. The business operates with a centralized kitchen that prepares all meals for distribution to consumers twice per week. All meals are packaged in a temperature-controlled facility for food safety and quality controls. While other meal plan companies ship meals directly to consumer’s homes, the SuperFit Foods model uses Company-owned coolers placed at designated pick-up locations throughout the Jacksonville, Florida market. Pick up locations are placed inside wellness centers such as gyms, yoga studios and various lifestyle locations. SuperFit Foods delivers twice per week by independent contractors to these locations and consumers conveniently pick up their orders after their workouts or during their daily routines. This model allows us to keep food fresh and refrigerated (even in the summer months), reduces shipping costs to consumers and provides an easier distribution model for the Company. While we do offer direct shipment to homes, this represents a small percentage of overall Company revenue.

Pokemoto Hawaiian Poke restaurants (“Pokemoto”): On May 14, 2021, MMI acquired the Pokemoto chain. This consisted of purchasing PKM Stamford LLC, Poke Co, LLC, LB Holdings LLC, and TNB Holdings LLC, Poke Co Holdings LLC, GLL Enterprises LLC, and TNB Holdings II, LLC, each a Connecticut limited liability company (collectively, Pokemoto”). Pokemoto Orange Park FL LLC and Pokemoto Kansas LLC (included in “Pokemoto”) were formed in 2022 for the purposes of developing new corporate Pokemoto stores. Pokemoto restaurants are fast-casual style restaurants that specialize in Hawaiian inspired poke bowls, wraps and salads. Poke is native Hawaiian cuisine made up of diced fresh fish served as an appetizer or main course with strong influences of Japanese and Korean cuisine. Think of it as deconstructed sushi that a consumer can customize into a bowl, salad or wrap every time. Hawaiian Poke is trending in the restaurant industry. It is a unique segment that is healthy, customizable, popular with millennials and Gen-Zs, offers unique flavor profiles and is “Instagrammable.”
 
Pokemoto offers consumers the possibility to customize their order every time. Consumers move down a linear production line (similar to Chipotle or Subway customer interaction and operations) customizing their bowl from a wide selection of ingredients. Pokemoto offers six types of protein including sushi grade tuna, salmon, chicken, shrimp, lobster seafood salad or tofu. Consumers pick a base of white/brown rice or salad, select from over 25 mix-ins/toppings including avocado, kani salad, pickled daikon, hijiki seaweed, masago, caviar, mandarin oranges, edamame, mango, roasted cashews or wonton crisps to name a few and topped off with over eight proprietary sauces that are made in house. All this gets mixed together creating a flavor explosion that is customized for every consumer. In select locations, we offer Boba tea in a variety of flavors.
 
Pokemoto requires little to no cooking. Everything is either raw (tuna, salmon, veggies and fruits) or comes in pre-cooked (chicken and shrimp). The only cooking we do is preparing soup and rice. It’s that simple. Because we have little cooking and consumers customize their orders, our labor requirements compared to most restaurants may be reduced. In addition, we believe training becomes much easier when you are not cooking or requiring recipes to be followed while consumers customize their menu options. This creates a consistent product across all our Pokemoto restaurants as we expand into more markets. Finally, because we have little to no cooking, our build outs usually do not require expensive hoods, fire suppression systems, deep fryers, grills, ovens, etc. making the potential cost of building out a location more favorable when compared to a traditional restaurant.
 
Sadot LLC: Sadot was formed on October 19, 2022, in Delaware and is a wholly owned subsidiary of MMI. Sadot is focused on international Agri-food commodity shipping, farming, sourcing and production of key ingredients such as soy meal, corn, wheat, food oils, etc. A typical shipment contains 25,000 to 75,000 metric tons of product, although some transactions can be smaller. Sadot was formed as part of the Company’s diversification strategy while still remaining within the overall food industry.
 
Our Industry
 
Muscle Maker Grill and Pokemoto restaurants operate within the Limited-Service Restaurant, or LSR, segment, of the United States restaurant industry, which includes quick service restaurants, or QSR, and fast-casual restaurants. We offer fast-casual quality food combined with quick-service speed, convenience and value across multiple dayparts. We believe our differentiated, high-quality healthy-inspired menu delivers great value all day, every day and positions us to compete against both QSR and fast-casual concepts.
 
SuperFit Foods operates within the pre-made, ready-to-eat meal prep segment. We offer pre-made, ready-to-eat meals that focus on specific dietary needs like keto, vegetarian, high protein, low sugars, etc. SuperFit Foods offers over 150 different meal plan options to choose from as well as various healthy juices, snacks and desserts.
 
Sadot operates within the international food commodity shipping, sourcing, farming and production segment of the overall food supply chain industry. Our current primary focus is on shipping food commodity items such as soy meal, corn and wheat between countries via cargo ships. These shipments provide raw materials and ingredients to various food manufacturers as part of the overall food supply chain.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy for the restaurant division concentrates on expansion through franchising. However, in order to “seed” new markets for franchising we may open Company-owned and operated locations in key markets.
 
We believe franchising is the future of the restaurant division. This strategy uses the franchising experience of the management team with the goal of expanding more quickly. We believe franchising has the potential to propel growth without our Company having to spend its capital on Company-owned brick and mortar locations.
 
Our franchising efforts will continue to be concentrated on expanding the Pokemoto brand. We believe there is a unique opportunity to grow the Pokemoto brand within the Hawaiian Poke segment of the restaurant industry. The Hawaiian Poke segment is fragmented with the largest company having approximately 65-85 locations today. The industry is full of independently owned “mom-and-pop” locations and we expect that the industry is ready for a company to enter the market and become a significant player in the segment. We are positioning Pokemoto with the goal of playing this role.
 
While Pokemoto franchising is the focus, we will also open Company-owned Pokemoto locations strategically placed in key markets where we are focusing our franchising efforts. Franchisee prospects need to experience Pokemoto locally versus having to travel long distances. This approach is critical to selling franchises. Each Company location should be considered as “seeding” the market. Eventually, when the market begins to open franchise locations, the intent is to franchise the original “seed” Company location and then turn to building and franchising the next market. This is a leapfrog strategy that has traditionally been used to drive franchise growth more aggressively.
 
Our strategy for our Muscle Maker Grill restaurants is to optimize the brand. This will be performed through cost reductions, co-branding locations with Pokemoto or converting the location to a Pokemoto restaurant. We will continue to evaluate profitability at each location while staying current with market trends in each specific location. As part of the optimization strategy, we will divert resources from any closed locations towards the remaining open locations with the intent of enhancing their performance.
 
Muscle Maker Grill restaurants are primarily geographically located in the Northeast United States, but we also have locations on military bases such as Fort Sill, Fort Bliss and Fort Benning, as well as franchise locations in Texas, Washington and California. In addition, we have locations open in Kuwait. Our Kuwaiti partner performs all operational support, training, distribution and manufacturing of various proprietary items that are used to supply their locations.
 
Improve Comparable Restaurant Sales. We plan to improve comparable restaurant sales growth through the following strategies:
 
Menu Strategy and Evolution: We will continue to adapt our menu to create entrées that complement our healthy-inspired offerings and that reinforce our differentiated fast-casual positioning. We believe we have opportunities for menu innovation as we look to provide customers more choices through customization and limited time only alternative proteins, recipes and other healthy-inspired ingredients. Our marketing and operations teams collaborate to ensure that the items developed in our test stores can be executed to our high standards in our restaurants with the speed and value that our customers have come to expect. To provide added variety, from time to time we introduce limited time offerings at Muscle Marker Grill, (“MMG”) and SuperFit Foods, (“SFF”) and Pokemoto, due to being highly customizable, will offer new proteins, sauces and other ingredients allowing consumers to try different flavor combinations.
 
Attract New Customers Through Expanded Brand Awareness: Our goal is to attract new customers as we expand our various concepts to become more widely known through new restaurant openings and marketing efforts focused on broadening the reach and appeal of our brand. The goal of our marketing efforts is to have consumers become more familiar with our brands as we continue to penetrate our markets, which we believe will benefit our existing restaurant base. Our marketing strategy centers on our “healthier for you” food, which highlights the desirability of healthy-inspired food or proprietary recipe quality of our food. We utilize various marketing techniques including email, text, social media, print, influencers, press releases, third party apps and local store marketing. We believe the restaurant industry has changed over the past few years and consumer preferences have shifted towards an emphasis on convenience, speed, customization, delivery and mobility. This has led to an increase in to-go orders, third-party delivery and direct to consumer meal prep/plan offerings. We believe our various brands have the ability to adjust our business strategy to accommodate these consumer trends.

Continue to Grow Dayparts: We currently have multiple dayparts and segments where revenue is generated in our restaurants. These dayparts and segments include: lunch, dinner, catering, smoothies/protein shakes and meal prep/plans in our various locations, and breakfast in select locations. We expect to drive growth across our dayparts through enhanced menu offerings, and marketing campaigns. We plan to continue introducing and marketing limited time offers to increase occasions across our dayparts as well as to educate customers on our lunch and dinner offerings. Muscle Maker Grill restaurants and SuperFit Foods have the unique opportunity to grow in the pre-packaged, portion-controlled meal prep/plan category. Currently, we offer pre-portioned and packaged meal prep/plans for consumers who want to specifically plan their weekly meals for dietary or nutritional needs. These meal plans can be delivered to a consumer’s home, picked up at each restaurant location or at our Company-owned coolers placed inside fitness, wellness or lifestyle facilities.
 
Third party delivery services such as Uber Eats, Grub Hub, DoorDash and others offer an expansion beyond the four walls of our restaurants and represents a growing segment of our overall revenue. We also have partnered with Snackpass in our Pokemoto restaurants. Snackpass offers online ordering, delivery and pick up while also providing an in-store kiosk where customers can place their orders versus waiting in line. Snackpass offers consumers the ability to earn game tokens for each order which can be used to play the Snackpass loyalty program game. The Company uses this partnership as an alternative to traditional loyalty programs and represents, in some locations, a significant portion of restaurant sales generated through this partnership.
 
Our strategy for Sadot is to own and operate, a wholesaling food business, focusing on international food commodity shipping, farming, sourcing and production of key ingredients such as soy meal, corn, wheat, food oils, etc. The goal of Sadot is to launch Muscle Maker into a new era by creating a comprehensive, global food company that stretches from sustainable farming, agricultural commodity shipping and trading, distribution, productions and ultimately reaches consumers through the restaurant, franchise and meal prep companies.
 
Sadot was formed as part of our diversification strategy while still remaining within the overall food industry. We aim implement this strategy through product and process innovations, supply chain commitments, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on increasing the volume and enhancing the efficiency of our global operations.
 
Our Strengths
 
Restaurant Division
 
Iconic and Unique Concept: We provide guests healthy-inspired versions of mainstream-favorite and customizable dishes that are intended to taste great, in our effort to make it convenient, affordable and enjoyable to eat healthier. Our diverse menu was created for everyone – fitness enthusiasts, those starting their journey to a healthier lifestyle, and people trying to eat better while on-the-go.
 
We are focused on expanding our presence through growing the Pokemoto brand within new and existing markets by continuing to add franchise partners to our system and increasing the number of corporate-owned locations. We have already signed 60 franchise agreements and opened 13 new locations since August of 2022. Our corporate-owned restaurants will focus on creating Pokemoto/Muscle Maker combo units where applicable. In addition to creating Pokemoto seed locations in key markets to supplement our franchise sales efforts while also offering direct to consumer pre-made meal prep/plan offerings to consumers within the Jacksonville, Florida market via SuperFit Foods.
 
Innovative, Healthier Menu: Our menus feature items such as grass-fed steak, all-natural chicken, lean turkey, plant-based products, tofu, chicken, salmon, shrimp, sushi grade tuna as well as options that satisfy all dietary preferences – from the carb-free consumer to guests following gluten-free or vegetarian diets. Our brands do not sacrifice taste to serve healthy-inspired options. We develop and source proprietary sauces and fat free or zero-carb dressings to enhance our unique flavor profiles. In addition to our healthy-inspired and diverse food platform, we offer 100% real fruit smoothies, boosters and proprietary protein shakes as well as retail supplements. While our Pokemoto concept offers consumers the possibility to customize their meal every time. Consumers move down a linear production line similar to Chipotle or Subway choosing their toppings with a modern twist including tofu, chicken, salmon, shrimp, lobster seafood salad, and sushi grade tuna. Pokemoto also offers a variety of flavors of Boba Teas.
 
The Company prides itself on making healthy-inspired versions of the guest’s favorite food, giving them easy access to the food they seek at our restaurants. This means catering to an array of healthier eating lifestyles.

All this gets mixed up together creating a flavor explosion that is customizable for each customer.

Delivery: Delivery is an option through our online ordering platform or third-party delivery apps making it easy and convenient for our guests. Delivery percentages range from 10% up to 85% of sales in our corporate locations. We strongly believe the delivery segment will continue to grow as our core demographic has demonstrated the need for online ordering and delivery versus dine-in and take-out. We and our franchise owners leverage employees for local delivery but also use third party services such as Uber Eats, GrubHub, DoorDash and others to fulfill delivery orders. SuperFit Foods delivers twice per week utilizing independent contractors to Company-owned coolers placed inside fitness, wellness or lifestyle facilities where consumers conveniently pick up their orders after their workouts or during their daily routines.
 
Meal Prep/Plans: To make healthy-inspired eating even easier, Muscle Maker Grill’s healthy-inspired menu items are available through our Meal Prep/Plan program, allowing pre-orders of meals via phone, online or in-store, available for pick up or delivered right to their door. Available as 5, 10, 15, or 20 meals, guests can choose from over 40 Muscle Maker Grill menu items for each meal.
 
SuperFit Foods consists of pre-made, ready-to-eat meals that focus on specific dietary needs like keto, vegetarian, high protein, low sugars, etc. SuperFit Foods offers over 150 different meal options to choose from as well as various healthy juices, snacks and desserts. SuperFit Foods operates as a subscription model where consumers are automatically charged each month. Consumers order online, provide their credit card information and have over 150 options to choose from. Guests can also opt. to select their likes and dislikes and meal selection becomes automatic. SuperFit Foods’ distribution process is different than most meal prep companies. Other meal prep companies ship meals directly to consumer’s homes or use their own fleet of vehicles to drop orders off at homes. SuperFit Foods prepares all meals in a temperature-controlled facility allowing for higher food safety and freshness. The SuperFit Foods model uses Company-owned coolers placed inside fitness, wellness or lifestyle facilities.
 
Sadot
 
On November 14, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company, Sadot and Aggia LLC FC, a company established under the laws of United Arab Emirates (“Aggia”) entered into a Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”). Pursuant to the Services Agreement, Sadot engaged Aggia to provide specialized advisory services to support the establishment, procurement, and management of Sadot’s global supply-chain integration business. The acquisition of assets and capabilities in sustainable Agri-Commodity farming, trading, transporting and processing, with the goal of eventually retailing through MMI’s restaurant brands is a critical component of this venture.
 
In order to assist with the growth of the Sadot business MMI expects to capitalize on the years of experience and industry knowledge of Aggia and leverage their expertise into additional verticals, without the time and capital outlaw of hiring the professionals independently.
 
Our Properties
 
Rent Structure: Our restaurants are typically located in retail centers as in-line locations or food court type settings in universities or military bases. A typical restaurant generally ranges from 800 to 2,500 square feet with seating for up to approximately 40 people. Our leases for Company-operated locations generally have terms of one to ten years, with one or two renewal terms of one year to ten years. Restaurant leases provide for a specified annual rent, and some leases call for additional or contingent rent based on revenue above specified levels. Generally, our leases are “net leases” that require us to pay a pro rata share of taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. New leases for our non-traditional locations usually have rent calculated as a percentage of net sales and have terms up to 10 years. We do not guarantee performance or have any liability regarding franchise location leases.
System-Wide Restaurant Counts: As of December 31, 2022, our restaurant system consisted of 44 restaurants comprised of 19 Company-operated restaurants and 25 franchised restaurants located in California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Kuwait.
 
Site Selection Process: We consider the location of a restaurant to be a critical variable in its long-term performance, and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential restaurant locations. Our in-house management team has extensive experience developing hundreds of locations for various brands. We use a combination of our in-house team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate and negotiate new sites using various criteria including demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the restaurant. The process for selecting locations incorporates managements and franchisee’s experience and expertise and includes data collection and analysis. Additionally, we use information and intelligence gathered from managers and other restaurant personnel that live in or near the neighborhoods we are considering.

Direct to consumer meal prep/plan locations can either be through existing Muscle Maker Grill restaurant locations or can be set up like a commissary where meals are prepared in a temperature-controlled kitchen space, not open to consumer traffic like SuperFit Foods. These locations can be in any area if pick up service via UPS or FedEx is available. This allows the Company to build out locations in favorable rent situations while being able to mail meal prep/plans direct to consumers within a 250-mile radius or conveniently drop off meals at various pick-up locations throughout the market.
 
Our Restaurant Design
 
After identifying a lease site, we commence our restaurant buildout. Our typical restaurant is an inline retail space or food court that ranges in size from 800 to 2,500 square feet. Our restaurants are characterized by a unique exterior and interior design, color schemes, and layout, including specially designed decor and furnishings. Restaurant interiors incorporate modern designs and rich colors in an effort to provide a clean and inviting environment and fun, family-friendly atmosphere. Each restaurant is designed in accordance with plans we develop; and constructed with a similar design motif and trade dress. Restaurants are generally located near other business establishments that will attract customers who desire healthier food at fair prices served in a casual, fun environment. We estimate it takes approximately four to six months from identification and lease signing of the specific site to opening the restaurant. This timeframe can be shortened to as little at 90 days pending the amount of time it takes to acquire equipment and complete leasehold improvements.
Our Restaurant Management and Operations
 
Service: We are extremely focused on customer service. We aim to provide fast, friendly service on a solid foundation of dedicated, driven team members and managers. Our team members and managers are responsible for our dining room environment, personally visiting tables to ensure every customer’s satisfaction.
 
Operations: We intend to measure the execution of our system standards within each restaurant through an audit program for quality, service and cleanliness. The goal is to conduct these audits quarterly and may be more or less frequent based upon restaurant performance. Additionally, we have food safety and quality assurance programs designed to maintain the high standards for food and food preparation procedures used by both Company-operated and franchised restaurants.
 
Managers and Team Members: Each of our restaurants typically has a manager or shift leader. At each Muscle Maker Grill restaurant location there are usually between six and ten team members who prepare our food fresh daily and provide customer service. At each Pokemoto location there are usually between two and four team members who prepare our food fresh daily and provide customer service.
 
We are selective in our hiring processes, aiming to staff our restaurants with team members that are friendly, customer-focused and driven to provide high-quality products. Our team members are cross-trained in several disciplines to maximize depth of competency and efficiency in critical restaurant functions.
 
Training: Our Franchisee training generally consists of 10 to 14 days in a certified training location, and an additional 7 to 10 days post opening training. Our operational team members provide consistent, ongoing training through follow up restaurant visits, inspections or email or phone correspondences.
 
Our Franchise Program
 
Overview: We use a franchising strategy to increase new restaurant growth, especially as we focus on growing the Pokemoto brand, in certain United States and international markets, leveraging the ownership of entrepreneurs with specific local market expertise and requiring a relatively minimal capital commitment by us. We believe the franchise revenue generated from our franchise base has historically served as an important source of stable and recurring cash flows to us and, as such, we plan to expand our base of franchised restaurants. We have signed 60 franchise agreements and opened 13 new locations since August 2022. We currently have over 50 franchise agreements sold, but not yet opened. In existing markets, we encourage growth from current franchisees. In our expansion markets, we seek highly motivated and entrepreneurial new franchisees for single-unit or multi-unit development opportunities. We market our franchise opportunities with the support of a franchising section on our website, social media, trade shows and other marketing tactics.

Franchise Owner Support: We believe creating a foundation of initial and on-going support is important to future performance for both our franchisees and our brand.
 
We have a mandatory training program that was designed to ensure that our franchise owners and their managers are equipped with the knowledge and necessary skills to operate our concept. The program consists of hands-on training in the operation and management of the restaurant. Training is conducted by a general training manager who has been certified by us for training. Instructional materials for the initial training program include our operations manual, crew training system, wall charts, job aids, recipe books, product build cards, management training materials, food safety book, videos and other materials we may create from time to time. Training must be successfully completed before a trainee can be assigned to a restaurant as a manager.
 
We also provide numerous opportunities for communication and shared feedback between us and franchise owners. Currently, we communicate on a frequent basis through email and virtual meetings allowing for questions and answers with all franchisees. In addition, our operations and marketing teams conduct phone calls and/or on-site visits on a frequent basis with franchisees on current operational changes, new products, revenue generating ideas, cost savings, and local store marketing.

Multi-Unit Development Agreements: Franchisees who desire to develop more than one restaurant and who have the financial strength and managerial capability to develop more than one restaurant may enter into a multi-unit development agreement. Under a multi-unit development agreement, the franchisee agrees to open a specified number of restaurants, at least two, within a defined geographic area in accordance with an agreed upon development schedule which could span several months or years. Each restaurant, in accordance with the development schedule, requires the execution of a separate franchise agreement prior to site approval and construction, which in most cases will be the then current franchise agreement, except that the initial franchise fee, royalty and advertising expenditures will be those in effect at the time the multi-unit agreement is executed. Multi-unit development agreements require the payment of a development fee ranging from $20,000 to $35,000 for the first restaurant plus ranging from $10,000 to $17,500 multiplied by the number of additional restaurants that must be opened under such development agreement. The entire development fee is payable at the time the multi-unit development agreement is signed; however, the development fee actually paid for a particular restaurant is credited as a deposit against the initial franchise fee that is payable when the franchise agreement for the particular franchise is signed.

Area Representative Agreements: Pursuant to our area representative agreements, the area representatives will identify and refer prospective franchisee candidates to us, provide franchisees with our site selection criteria and assist franchisees to complete a site review package, and will advise franchisees concerning our standards and specifications, perform on-going training as required and make quarterly on-site visits and inspections, but we retain control of all decision-making authority relative to the franchisees, including franchisee approval, site location approval and determination whether franchisees are in compliance with their franchise agreements.
 
Area representative agreements are generally for a term ranging from 10 to 20 years, in consideration for which we generally compensate area representatives with a range of 1% to 2% of net sales of the franchises that are under the area representative for the term of the agreement as well as up to 50% of the initial franchise fees for new franchise agreements.
 
Our Marketing and Advertising
 
We promote our restaurants and products through multiple advertising campaigns. The campaigns aim to deliver our message of fresh and healthy-inspired product offerings. The campaign emphasizes our points of differentiation, from our fresh ingredients and in-house preparation to the preparation of our healthy inspired meals.
 
We use multiple marketing channels, including social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, email, text marketing, local store marketing, public relations/press releases and other methods to broadly drive brand awareness and purchases of our featured products. We complement this periodically with direct mail.
 
Our Purchasing and Distribution
 
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. Food and supplies are delivered to most of our restaurants one to two times per week. Our franchisees are required to use our primary distributors, or an approved regional distributor and franchisees must purchase food and supplies from approved suppliers. In our normal course of business, we evaluate bids from multiple suppliers for various products. Fluctuations in supply and prices can significantly impact our restaurant service and profit performance.
 
Since Sadot is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of our principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.
 
The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect our Company’s working capital requirements.

Our Competition
 
Restaurant Division
 
We operate in the restaurant industry, which is highly competitive and fragmented. The number, size and strength of competitors vary by region. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains that offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services as well as meal prep companies. Our competition in the broadest perspective includes restaurants, pizza parlors, convenience food stores, delicatessens, supermarkets, third party delivery services, direct to consumer meal prep and club stores. However, we indirectly compete with fast-casual restaurants, including Chipotle and Panera Bread, among others, and with healthy inspired fast-casual restaurants, such as Pokeworks, Freshii and Veggie Grill as well as direct-to-consumer meal prep such as Freshly, among others.
 
We believe competition within the fast-casual restaurant and meal prep segments is based primarily on ambience, price, taste, quality and the freshness of the menu items. We also believe that QSR competition is based primarily on quality, taste, speed of service, value, brand recognition, restaurant location and customer service. We believe the restaurant industry has changed over the past few years due to the COVID-19 specifically as it relates to delivery and how consumers interact with brands. This changing environment will require flexibility and the ability to rapidly make adjustments.
 
As consumer preferences continue to evolve into healthier eating options, most restaurants are developing healthier menu choices. As more restaurants offer healthier options, the competition for our product offerings becomes more intense and could pose a significant threat to future revenues. However, we believe our experience, size and flexibility allows Muscle Maker, Inc’s portfolio of Companies to adapt faster than many other restaurant concepts.
 
Sadot
 
Sadot operates in the global agribusiness industry. We have significant competition in the markets in which we operate based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply and alternative products. Given the commodity-based nature of our business, Sadot, on an ongoing basis, expects to focus on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements and productivity enhancements.
Our Management Information Systems
 
All of our Company-operated and franchised restaurants use computerized point-of-sale and back-office systems, which we believe are scalable to support our long-term growth plans. The point-of-sale system provides a touch screen interface and a stand-alone high-speed credit card and gift card processing terminal. The point-of-sale system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales and product mix that we actively analyze. Our SuperFit Foods division sales are 100% online through the superfitfoods.com website.
 
Our computer systems are designed to assist in the management of MMI. The systems also provide corporate headquarters and our operations team with quick access to detailed business data and reduces the time spent by our managers on administrative needs. The systems also provide sales, bank deposit and variance data to our accounting department.
 
Third party delivery and meal prep/plan sales are ordered using online software or apps with reports generated through various software packages provided by the third-parties.
