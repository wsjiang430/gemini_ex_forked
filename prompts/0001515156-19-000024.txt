Item 1. Business
General
ADA-ES, Inc. (“ADA”), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated in 1997. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Reorganization"), effective July 1, 2013, Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. (“ADES”), a Delaware company incorporated in 2011, replaced ADA as the publicly-held corporation and ADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADES. ADES’s common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol, "ADES." ADA’s stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on July 1, 2013. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to as the "Form 10-K" or the "Report." As used in this Report, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" means ADES and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We provide environmental solutions to customers in coal-fired power generation, municipal water and other industries primarily through emissions and water purification control technologies of our subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our proprietary technologies and associated product offerings provide pollutant control solutions to enable coal-fired power generators, municipal water and industrials to meet applicable regulations. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we held equity interests of 42.50% and 50.00% in Tinuum Group, LLC ("Tinuum Group") and Tinuum Services, LLC ("Tinuum Services"), respectively, and each of their operations significantly impacted our financial position and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We account for Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services under the equity method of accounting.
We operate two segments: Refined Coal (“RC”) and Power Generation and Industrials (“PGI”) (f/k/a "Emissions Control" or "EC"). The segments are discussed in more detail later under this Item 1. Our products are currently used for the removal of mercury and other air pollutants and for the purification of water.
Carbon Solutions Acquisition
On December 7, 2018 (the "Acquisition Date"), ADES entered into the Purchase and Sale Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase from Energy Capital Partners I, LP, Energy Capital Partners I-A, LP, Energy Capital Partners I-B IP, LP, Energy Capital Partners I (Crowfoot IP), LP, and Carbon Solutions Management, LLC 100% of the membership interests of ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ("Carbon Solutions") for a total purchase price of $75.0 million (the "Carbon Solutions Acquisition") plus transaction fees of $4.5 million. The fair value of the purchase consideration ("Purchase Consideration") was $66.5 million and consisted of cash consideration of $65.8 million and an additional purchase adjustment amount payable to Carbon Solutions' secured lender of $0.7 million. The Company acquired Carbon Solutions to enter into the broader activated carbon market and to expand the Company's product offerings within the mercury control industry and other complementary activated carbon markets. Carbon Solutions owns and operates an activated carbon manufacturing and processing facility and owns an associated lignite mine, which supplies the raw material for the powdered activated carbon plant (“Five Forks Mine”). 
The Company primarily funded the cash consideration in the Carbon Solutions Acquisition from a $70.0 million senior term loan facility, less original issue discount of $2.1 million (the "Senior Term Loan"), which is detailed below in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("Item 7").
Markets
Activated carbon ("AC") is a specialized sorbent material that is used widely in a host of industrial and consumer applications to remove impurities, contaminants or pollutants from gas, water and other product or waste streams. ACs are prepared by thermally and/or chemically treating carbonaceous raw materials, including wood, coal, nut shells, resins and petroleum pitch. They are engineered specifically to meet the end-use application. Properties, such as pore and surface features, can be modified to be highly selective to targeted contaminants. The form of the AC, whether as a powdered activated carbon ("PAC"), granular activated carbon ("GAC"), pellets, honeycombs, blocks or cloths, also is important for the application. 
Key markets include removal of heavy metal pollutants from coal-burning electrical generation processes, treatment of drinking and waste waters, industrial acid gas and odor removal, automotive gasoline emission control, soil and ground water remediation and food and beverage process and product purifications. 
The AC market has been and is expected to continue to be driven by environmental regulations, principally water and air purification, especially in the mature and more industrialized areas of the world. Additionally, we believe environmental issues will continue to be the predominant force in the AC markets of rapidly developing countries.

Power Generation and Industrials
We expect the share of coal-fired power generation as a percentage of U.S. electricity generation to be more stable compared to previous years when many coal-fired generating units were shut down in response to low gas prices and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. Further, we believe that coal-fired power generation will remain a significant component of the U.S. power generation mix for many years, given coal's abundance, affordability, reliability and availability as a domestic fuel source. In 2018, the Energy Information Administration ("EIA") estimates coal made up 28% of the U.S. electricity generation. In its Annual Energy Outlook for 2019, the EIA projects that coal will provide approximately 17% of U.S. electricity generation in 2050. The primary drivers for many of our products and services are environmental laws and regulations impacting the electric power generation industry and other coal users. These regulations include the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS"), a U.S. federal regulation requiring all existing and any new coal-fired electricity generating units to control mercury emissions, acid gases, and particulate matter, as well as various state regulations and permitting requirements for coal-fired electricity generating units. In addition to the federal MATS rule, many states have their own mercury rules that are similar to, or more stringent than, MATS, and many coal-fired electricity generating units around the country have agreed to consent decrees, which require pollution controls that, in some cases, are more restrictive than the existing regulations. We continue to believe the MATS regulation as well as certain state regulations creates a market for our RC and PGI products.
In general, coal is a low cost, stable and reliable source of domestic energy that, unlike many other forms of energy, can be easily stored in large quantities. We believe coal is critical to ensuring the U.S. has a secure and stable source of energy. 
While the long-term future for coal as a fuel source for electricity generation is uncertain, and as coal assets continue to age, we expect a continued purchasing trend towards variable cost products and integrated solutions with low capital expenditure requirements and a move away from large capital equipment and other fixed cost solutions that are less likely to have costs recovered.
We believe it is likely that many U.S. coal mines, coal-fired electricity generating units, coal-centric large equipment providers and other coal-related businesses will have difficulty adapting to industry changes expected in the coming years. However, we see opportunities for companies that can offer their customers creative and cost-effective solutions that help U.S. coal-related businesses meet regulatory compliance, improve efficiency, lower costs and maintain reliability.
Water
AC, particularly PAC, has been used in the treatment of drinking water, wastewater, contaminated soil and groundwater to absorb compounds causing unpleasant taste and odor and other contaminants. Both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants consume AC in their processes. 
Groundwater contamination has become a matter of increasing concern to federal and state governments as well as to the public, especially within the last 10 years. The U.S may see significant growth from water purification markets, especially if future regulations are passed controlling certain chemicals in drinking water. At present, individual states are primarily responsible for the protection of groundwater. Worldwide, water treatment accounts for 41% of the total consumption of AC, and continues to be the largest application for AC. 
We see opportunities in the water market for our products that will provide cost-effective solutions to help industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants meet water purification standards.
Segments
Refined Coal 
Tinuum Group, an unconsolidated entity, provides reduction of mercury and nitrogen oxide ("NOX") emissions at select coal-fired power generators through the production and sale of Refined Coal ("RC") that qualifies for tax credits under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit ("Section 45 tax credits"). We benefit from Tinuum Group's production and sale of RC, which generates tax credits, as well as the revenue from selling or leasing RC facilities to tax equity investors. See the separately filed financial statements of Tinuum Group included in Item 15 - "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" ("Item 15") of this Report.
Products
Our patented CyCleanTM ("CyClean") technology, a pre-combustion coal treatment process provides electric power generators the ability to enhance combustion and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides ("NOX") and mercury from coals burned in cyclone boilers.
Our patented M-45TM and M-45-PCTM technologies (collectively, the "M-45 Technology") are proprietary pre-combustion coal treatment technologies used to control emissions from circulating fluidized bed boilers and pulverized coal boilers, respectively.

Sales and Customers
Our RC segment derives its earnings from equity method investments as well as royalty payment streams and other revenues related to reduced emissions of both NOX and mercury from coal treated with our proprietary chemicals and burned at coal-fired electricity generating units. Our equity method investments in the RC segment include Tinuum Group, Tinuum Services and GWN Manager, LLC.
As of December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group has built and placed into service a total of 28 RC facilities designed to produce RC for sale to coal-fired electricity generating units. Coal-fired electricity generating units use RC as one of a portfolio of tools to help comply with MATS and other environmental regulations. These RC facilities produce and sell RC that qualifies for Section 45 tax credits, including meeting the "placed in service" requirements (referred to as "placed in service"). The IRS has issued guidance regarding emissions reductions in the production of electricity by coal-fired electric generating units, including measurement and certification criteria necessary to qualify for the Section 45 tax credits. The ability to produce and sell RC, which generates Section 45 tax credits, expires 10 years after each RC facility was placed in service, but not later than December 31, 2021. Two of Tinuum Group's RC facilities were placed in service in 2009 and related Section 45 tax credits for these facilities expire in December 2019. The Section 45 tax credits related to the remaining RC facilities expire in 2021.
Once an RC facility is in operation, Tinuum Group may lease or sell it to a tax equity investor, which we refer to as an "invested" RC facility. The tax equity investor subsequently operates the RC facility to produce and sell RC to a utility. It is financially advantageous for Tinuum Group to lease or sell an RC facility as the tax equity investor assumes the operating expenses for the RC facility and remits to Tinuum Group either payments to purchase or lease payments to lease the RC facility. We benefit from equity income and cash distributions through our investment in Tinuum Group. Tax equity investors may benefit from their investment in RC facilities through the realization of tax assets and credits from the production and sale of RC.
RC facilities that are producing and selling RC and have not been leased or sold, are referred to as "retained" RC facilities, whereby the RC is produced and sold by Tinuum Group and, as an owner, we benefit from the related Section 45 tax benefits. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Section 45 tax credits were $7.03 and $6.91 per ton of RC produced and sold to a utility. The value of the Section 45 tax credits is adjusted annually based on inflation adjustment factors published in the Federal Register. As of December 31, 2018, we have received, but have not been able to fully utilize, substantial tax credits and benefits from certain retained RC facilities that previously produced and sold RC for the benefit of Tinuum Group. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Report for additional information regarding our net operating losses, tax credits and other deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group had 19 invested RC facilities producing RC at utility sites. The remaining 9 RC facilities, although placed in service, were either installed but not operating, awaiting site selection or in various other stages of contract negotiation or permanent installation.
Tinuum Services operates and maintains RC facilities under operating and maintenance agreements with Tinuum Group and owners or lessees of RC facilities. Tinuum Group or the owners or lessees of the RC facilities pay Tinuum Services, subject to certain limitations, the costs of operating and maintaining the RC facilities plus various fees. Tinuum Services also arranges for the purchase and delivery of certain chemical additives under chemical agency agreements, which include the chemicals required for our CyClean, and M-45 Technologies that are necessary for the production of RC. The term of each chemical agency agreement runs concurrently with the respective RC facility's operating and maintenance agreement.
We also earn royalty revenues from the licensing of our M-45 Technology ("M-45 License") to Tinuum Group. License royalties are recognized based upon a percentage of the per-ton, pre-tax margin as defined in the M-45 License.
The following table provides summary information related to the Company's investment in Tinuum Group and the related RC facilities as of December 31, 2018 and tons of RC produced and sold for the year ended December 31, 2018:

 | | | | Operating
 | # of RC Facilities | Not Operating | | Invested | Retained
RC Facilities | 28 | | 9 | | 19 | | (1) | —
RC tons produced and sold (000's) | | | | 59,737 | | 2,302 | 

(1) One RC facility is approximately 50% invested with an independent third party. The remaining approximate 50% is retained by Tinuum Group, the Company and another member of Tinuum Group.

Competition
We believe Chem-Mod, LLC ("Chem-Mod") and licensees of the Chem-Mod technology are Tinuum Group's principal competitors. Competition within the RC market is based primarily on price, the number of tons of coal burned at the coal-fired electric generating unit where the RC facilities are operating and the tax compliance facts associated with each RC facility. Additionally, competition for tax equity investors extends into other investment opportunities, including opportunities related to potential tax incentive transactions.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used in our RC products are comprised of non-bromine based halogens. 
Operations
Tinuum RC facilities are located at coal-fired power plants in the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services had operations in 13 and 11 states, respectively.
Power Generation and Industrials
Products
Our products provide mercury control and other air and water contaminants control to coal-fired power generators and other industrial companies. Most of the North American coal-fired power generators have installed equipment to control air pollutants, like mercury, over the last several years. However, many power generators need consumable products on a recurring basis to chemically and physically capture mercury and other contaminants. There are three primary consumable products, working in conjunction with the installed equipment, to control mercury: PAC, coal additives and scrubber additives. In many cases these three consumable products can be used together or in many circumstances substituted for each other. However, activated carbon is typically the most efficient and effective way to capture mercury and currently accounts for over 50% of the mercury control consumables North American market. We offer all three mercury control solutions and continually work with customers to implement the most effective and efficient consumables solutions that fit with their unique operating and pollutions control configuration. 
Power generators must stay in compliance with the various regulatory emissions requirements. As such, we believe power generators’ top priority is to find a vendor that can consistently and reliably provide a consumables solution. However, as the market has matured since 2016 and coal-fired power continues to be under pricing pressure from natural gas, wind and solar, cost of compliance is also important. Our current products and services provide solutions across the entire spectrum of coal-fired power generators' needs. 
Historically, our PGI segment included revenues and related expenses from the sale of activated carbon injection ("ACI") and dry sorbent injection ("DSI") equipment systems, consulting services and other sales related to the reduction of emissions in the coal-fired electricity generation process and the electric utility industry. Demand for ACI and DSI system contracts historically was driven by coal-fired power plants that needed to comply with MATS and Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT") Standards. As the deadline for these standards has passed, and customers have now implemented ACI, DSI and other large equipment systems as a component of their strategies to comply with applicable regulations, we do not anticipate entering into future long-term fixed price contracts for ACI or DSI systems. However, we may continue to provide smaller scale equipment products or other consulting services that may be needed by coal-fired electricity generating units, industrial broiler or other power generation units as part of their ongoing operations.
Sales and Customers
Sales of AC and chemical technologies are made by the Company’s employees and through distributors and sales representatives to coal-fired utilities and industrials. Some of our sales of AC are made under annual requirements-based contracts or longer-term agreements.
Competition
Our primary competitors for PAC products include Cabot Norit America, Inc., a division of Cabot Corporation (CBT), Calgon Carbon, a subsidiary of Tokyo Stock Exchange listed Kuraray Co., Ltd., Nalco Holding Company, a subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. (ECL) and Midwest Energy Emissions Corp (MEEC).
Raw Materials
The principal raw material we use in the manufacturing of AC is lignite coal, which is, in general, readily available and we believe we have an adequate supply. We own a lignite mine, which is operated by Demery Resources Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company, that supplies lignite to our AC plant.
6

We purchase our proprietary chemicals through negotiated blending contracts that include confidentiality agreements with chemical suppliers. These arrangements attempt to assure continuous supply of our proprietary chemical blends. The manufacturing of our chemical products is dependent upon certain discrete chemicals that are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of chemical suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our proprietary chemicals is limited. Supply agreements are generally renewed on an annual basis.
Operations
We own and operate an AC plant that is located in Louisiana. We also have sales, product development and administrative operations located in Colorado.

Legislation and Environmental Regulations 
Our products and services, as well as Tinuum Group’s production and sale of RC, are for the reduction of pollutants and other contaminants in the coal-burning electrical generation and water treatment processes. To the extent that legislation and regulation limit the amount of pollutants and other contaminants permitted, the need for our products increases. Below is a summary of the primary legislation and regulation that affects the market for our products.
U.S. Federal Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (“MATS”) Affecting Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
On December 16, 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued the final "MATS Rule" that went into effect in April 2012. The EPA structured the MATS Rule as a MACT-based hazardous pollutant regulation applicable to coal and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (“EGU”), which generate electricity through steam turbines and have a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater, and provide for, among other provisions, control of mercury and particulate matter and control of acid gases such as hydrochloric acid ("HCl"), sulfuric acid ("H2SO4") and other Hazardous Air Pollutants ("HAPs"). Approximately 1,260 units were coal-fired EGUs. According to our estimates, the MATS Rule sets a limit that we believe requires the capture of up to 80-90% of the mercury in the coal burned in electric power generation boilers as measured at the exhaust stack outlet for most plants. The MACT standards are also known as National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). Plants generally had four years to comply with the MATS Rule, and we estimate that, based on data reported to the EPA and conversations with plant operators, most plants were required to comply by April 2016 and implementation of the MATS Rule is now largely complete. We estimate that 48% of the coal-fired EGUs that were operating in December 2011 when the MATS rule was finalized have been permanently shut down, leaving approximately 642 EGUs in operation at the end of 2018.
In April 2017, a review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of a 2016 “supplemental finding” associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule conducted by the EPA was stayed at the request of the current Administration. The court case continues to be stayed indefinitely. In February 2019, the EPA published a reconsideration of its 2016 "supplemental finding" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. This reconsideration proposes that it is not 'appropriate or necessary' to regulate HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-filed EGUs. However, the EPA expressly states that the reconsideration is not removing coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, but does, in the reconsideration, solicit comments on whether the EPA has the authority to remove coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS Rule or whether it can rescind the MATS Rule. 
State Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations Affecting EGUs
In addition, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to or more stringent than the MATS Rule, and coal-fired electricity generating units in the U.S are subject to consent decrees that require the control of acid gases and particulate matter, in addition to mercury emissions. 
7

Effluent Limitation Guidelines
On September 30, 2015, the EPA set the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The final rule requires, among other things, zero discharge for fly ash transport water, and limits on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate from flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater (also known as "legacy wastewater"). In April 2017 the EPA Administrator announced his decision to reconsider the Effluent Limitations Guidelines ("ELG") Rule, and the U.S. Court of Appeals Fifth Circuit granted the motion to reconsider and placed the case in abeyance, which delayed the earliest compliance date from November 2018 to November 2020. In September 2017, the EPA indicated that plants would not need to comply before November 2020, with a possible extension of up to five years with state approval. Although halogens are not directly regulated in the effluent guidelines, some halogens may impact the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment systems that are often used for the removal of selenium. We are evaluating whether the potential market opportunity supports our development of new products to help plants comply with these rules, as well as how these rules may affect our current product offerings.
Additional U.S. Legislation and Regulations
On August 3, 2015, the EPA finalized rules to reduce greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in the form of the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"), which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions. Under the CPP, states are required to prepare State Implementation Plans to meet state targets established based on emission reductions from affected sources. The CPP requires that the Best System of Emission Reduction ("BSER") be implemented and establishes three building blocks that include heat rate improvements at affected coal-fired electric generating units, substituting coal-fired generation with less carbon-intensive EGUs such as natural gas combined cycle plants, and substituting renewable generation. The CPP has been challenged by multiple states in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("DC Circuit"). The CPP is currently stayed by the Supreme Court, and a panel of 10 judges on the DC Circuit are reviewing the CPP following a hearing in September 2016. On October 10, 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the CPP. The DC Circuit has been holding CPP litigation in abeyance since April 28, 2017.
Anti-Dumping 
Regulators in the U.S. have imposed an anti-dumping duty on Chinese steam activated carbon products. In 2018, this anti-dumping duty was extended for an additional five-years. The International Trade Administration, a part of the U.S. Commerce Department, reviews the amount of the anti-dumping duty on an annual basis.
International Regulations
There are various international regulations related to mercury control. In Canada, the Canada-Wide Standard ("CWS") was initially implemented in 2010, with increasingly stringent limits through 2020 and with varying mercury emissions caps for each province. China and Germany both have limits for mercury emissions that are less stringent than U.S. limits and are typically met using co-benefits from other installed air pollution control equipment designed to control other pollutants. In May 2017, the EU ratified the Minimata Convention on Mercury, triggering mercury control regulations with implementation starting in 2021. Specific emissions limits are currently being developed guided by the best available technologies reference ("BREF") document for limiting stack emissions and liquid effluents from industrial processes. The BREF conclusions for large coal-fired electricity generating units were adopted by the European Commission in July 2017.
Based upon the existing and potential regulations, we believe the international market for mercury control products may expand in the coming years, and we are positioning our patent portfolio and existing commercial products accordingly to be prepared if an international market for our products develops.
Patents 
As of December 31, 2018, we held 53 U.S. patents and seven international patents that were issued or allowed, 27 additional U.S. provisional patents or applications that were pending, and seven international patent applications that were either pending or filed relating to different aspects of our technology. Our existing patents generally have terms of 20 years from the date of filing, with our next patents expiring beginning in 2021. We consider many of our patents and pending patents to be critical to the ongoing conduct of our business. 
Seasonality of Activities 
The sale of our consumable products and RC facility operation levels depends on the operations of the coal-fired electricity generating units to which the applicable consumables are provided and the location of the RC facilities, respectively. Power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling needs. Additionally, coal-fired electricity generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending 
8

upon the operation of the boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, no consumables are used or RC produced and sold, and our revenues may be correspondingly reduced. 
The sale of our activated carbon products for water purification depends on demand from municipal water treatment facilities where these products are utilized. Depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors the summer months historically have the highest demand for powdered AC, as one of the major uses for powdered AC is for the treatment of taste and odor problems caused by increased degradation of organic contaminants and natural materials in water during the summer.
Safety, Health and Environment
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters (“SH&E Regulations”). These SH&E Regulations include requirements to maintain and comply with various environmental permits related to the operation of many of our facilities, including mine health and safety laws required for continued operation of the Five Forks Mine.
Dependence on Major Customers 
We depend on our customer relationships with owners and operators of coal-fired power electricity generating units and industrial companies as well as general market demand for coal-fueled power generation. Additional information related to major customers is disclosed in Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 
Through our investment in Tinuum Group, we depend on our relationships with owners and operators of coal-fired power generation facilities, including various electric utilities and tax equity investors. Tinuum Group is the exclusive licensee for purposes of producing RC using the CyClean and M-45 Technologies. Tinuum Group depends on tax equity investors, with significant concentration within affiliates of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. These investors could renegotiate or terminate their leases, or the utilities where the RC facilities are installed could materially reduce their use of RC.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we employed 128 full-time and part-time personnel; 45 employees were employed at our offices in Colorado and 83 employees were employed at our facilities in Louisiana.
