Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing our proprietary drug discovery and development platform to create Synthetic Biotic™ medicines, which are designed using synthetic biology to genetically reprogram beneficial microbes to treat metabolic and inflammatory diseases and cancer. Synthetic Biotic medicines are generated by applying the principles and tools of synthetic biology to engineer beneficial microbes to perform or deliver critical therapeutic functions. As living medicines, Synthetic Biotic medicines can be designed to sense a local disease context within a patient’s body and to respond by metabolizing a toxic substance, compensating for missing or damaged metabolic pathways in patients, or by delivering combinations of therapeutic factors. Our goal is to lead in the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic therapies as living medicines capable of robust and precise pathway complementation and delivery of therapeutic benefit to patients.    
 We believe that our Synthetic Biotic platform has potential to address both metabolic and immune-mediated diseases and we are evaluating these medicines at different sites of action via different routes of administration, either orally or via injection. While we have designed and created a number of bacterial strains that could potentially be used therapeutically in  a range of diseases, our initial focus is on metabolic diseases that could potentially be treated following oral delivery of a living medicine to the gut. This includes metabolic diseases, which include rare genetic diseases as well as metabolic diseases caused by organ dysfunction.  When delivered orally, Synthetic Biotic medicines are designed to act from the gut to compensate for a dysfunctional metabolic pathway that results in the toxic accumulation of a metabolite with the intended consequence of reducing the systemic levels of the metabolite. We believe that success in our lead programs in rare metabolic diseases will enable us to demonstrate the potential of our oral Synthetic Biotic medicines to address metabolic dysfunction while bringing meaningful change to the lives of patients suffering from these debilitating conditions. 
 Our two lead therapeutic programs are being developed for the treatment of hyperammonemia and phenylketonuria (PKU). SYNB1020, our first therapeutic program to enter clinical trials, is an oral therapy intended for the treatment of hyperammonemia, which includes patients with liver disease such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and patients with urea cycle disorders (UCD). In these conditions ammonia accumulates in the body and becomes toxic, leading to neurocognitive crisis and risk of long-term cognitive or behavioral impairment, coma or death. SYNB1020 has received both Fast Track Designation and orphan drug designation for UCD from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in June 2017 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers. In November 2017, we announced top-line data from this study that demonstrated that SYNB1020 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved proof-of-mechanism. In March 2018, we initiated a clinical trial in patients with cirrhosis and elevated blood ammonia to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SYNB1020 as well as the ability of this Synthetic Biotic medicine to lower systemic levels of ammonia.  We expect to have top-line data from this study in mid-2019. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of ammonia lowering in patients with cirrhosis, we will determine the clinical development path for SYNB1020 for the treatment of conditions resulting in hyperammonemia. 
 SYNB1618, our second program to enter clinical trials, is an oral therapy intended for the treatment of PKU, a rare metabolic disease in which the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) accumulates in the body as a result of genetic defects. Elevated levels of Phe are toxic to the brain and can lead to neurological dysfunction. SYNB1618 is designed to function in the gut of patients to reduce excess Phe, with the goal of lowering levels in the blood and other tissues. SYNB1618 has received both Fast Track designation and orphan drug designation for PKU from the FDA. We initiated a Phase 1 / 2a clinical trial for SYNB1618 in April 2018 and announced top-line data from this study in September 2018 that demonstrated that SYNB1618 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved proof-of-mechanism in healthy volunteers and we are currently evaluating SYNB1618 in patients with PKU. We expect to have patient data from this study in mid-2019.
 We have developed a portfolio of immuno-oncology (IO) programs designed to deliver activities to modify the tumor microenvironment, activate the immune system and result in tumor reduction, and we envision that multiple engineered functions could be combined in one Synthetic Biotic medicine. These products could also be used in combination with other cancer therapies such as check-point inhibitors. In November 2018, we announced the selection of our first Synthetic Biotic clinical IO candidate, SYNB1891, and have advanced it into preclinical studies to enable filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA in the second half of 2019. SYNB1891 is an intratumorally administered Synthetic Biotic medicine designed to act as a dual innate activator of the immune system by stimulation via the E.coli Nissle chassis and production of cyclic di-AMP, an activator of the STING pathway.

Our early-stage metabolic pipeline includes discovery-stage product candidates for rare metabolic diseases, GI and immune disorders with high unmet needs. We are also leveraging our proprietary technology platform to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines to treat a broader range of human diseases, including metabolic diseases, inflammation and cancer. Synthetic Biotic medicines can be designed to locally deliver combinations of complementary therapeutics to treat these complex disease states. 
 To progress our pipeline, we collaborate with key disease experts who have developed robust models of relevant diseases to guide selection of our development candidates and to inform our translational medicine strategy. We focus on indications with clear biomarkers associated with disease progression that enable straightforward, early and ongoing assessment of potential clinical benefit throughout the development process. Our collaboration and intellectual property strategies additionally focus on building or leveraging existing third-party expertise in therapeutic research, preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization, while also enhancing our industry-leading position in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. 
 We have a collaboration with AbbVie S.à.r.l. (AbbVie) to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. We have also established a technology collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks, a privately held high-throughput synthetic biology company, to enable the discovery of new living medicines.  We may enter into additional strategic partnerships in the future to maximize the value of our programs and our Synthetic Biotic platform. 
 We are supported by our Board of Directors and our scientific advisory board, each of which offer complementary experience in drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies, management, and business development. Our founding science came from the laboratories of Professors James Collins and Timothy Lu from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who remain highly engaged in guiding development and application of our platform. 

Our pipeline of our programs is shown below. 
 


As we advance our lead programs, we continue to learn and improve our Synthetic Biotic platform, which will inform all future portfolio programs. Consequently, we believe we have a robust engine for building a sustainable pipeline of novel, living medicines across a range of diseases. Through the strength of our internal team and network of partners, we believe we can deliver on the promise of Synthetic Biotic medicines to improve the lives of patients with significant unmet medical needs. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to use our Synthetic Biotic platform to design, develop and commercialize living medicines to transform the lives of patients for whom conventional treatment approaches are either not available or have limited efficacy and safety. To achieve our goal, we are pursuing the following key strategies:

Advance Clinical Development of the SYNB1020 Hyperammonemia Program. We initiated our first Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1020 to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers in June 2017. In November 2017, we announced top-line data from this study that demonstrated that SYNB1020 was safe, achieved proof-of-mechanism and enabled us to identify a dose that could be taken forward into a study in patients. In April 2018, we initiated the first clinical trial  of a Synthetic Biotic medicine in patients to evaluate SYNB1020 in individuals with cirrhosis as a result of liver disease who had elevated blood ammonia. We expect to have top-line data from this study by mid-2019. Further clinical development of SYNB1020 as a treatment for conditions resulting in hyperammonemia, including HE and UCDs, will be informed by a number of factors, including data from our Phase 1b / 2a study in patients with cirrhosis.
Advance Clinical Development of SYNB1618 for PKU. We initiated a Phase 1 / 2a clinical trial of SYNB1618 in April 2018. The Phase 1 / 2a clinical trial protocol included healthy volunteers, as well as adult patient cohorts, and is designed to assess safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics. In September 2018, we announced top-line data from this study that demonstrated that SYNB1618 was safe in healthy volunteers, achieved proof-of-mechanism and enabled us to identify a dose for evaluation in patients with PKU. We expect to have data from the patient cohorts of this study, including insights regarding therapeutic potential from mechanistic biomarkers, by mid-2019. With supportive data from this study we expect to advance SYNB1618 to a larger clinical trial to assess its impact on blood Phe levels in patients with PKU.
 Advance our first IO program into Clinical Development and Continue to Advance our Preclinical Pipeline. We are advancing IND-enabling studies of SYNB1891, our first IO program, with the goal of filing an IND application in the second half of 2019.  We plan to continue to leverage our expertise from our lead programs to accelerate development of discovery-stage Synthetic Biotic programs in lead optimization for the potential treatment of rare metabolic, GI and immune disorders with high unmet needs.
 Support Clinical Pipeline Progress with Expanded Manufacturing and Formulation Capability. In December 2018, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities to produce clinical trial material for mid-stage studies of our rare metabolic disease and IO programs, through entry into an agreement to lease good manufacturing practice (GMP) clean-room space in Waltham, Massachusetts. The new clean-room facility provides an affordable and flexible option that maximizes control over our processes and timelines enabling us to move efficiently through clinical development to bring our Synthetic Biotic medicines to patients.
 Maximize the Value of the Synthetic Biotic Platform by Leveraging Strategic Partnerships. Our current partnership with AbbVie is focused on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic-based therapies for the treatment of IBD, and in November 2018 we announced receipt of a second milestone payment for this program. We expect to continue to explore strategic partnerships that would leverage the complementary capabilities of our partners to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines and maximize the value of our Synthetic Biotic platform.
 Expand the Synthetic Biotic Platform to Lead in the Discovery and Development of Additional Living Medicines and Enabling Technologies. As leaders in the development of engineered non-pathogenic bacteria for therapeutic use, we intend to advance the field of living medicines by continuing to innovate and broaden the potential of our Synthetic Biotic platform to deliver clinically meaningful benefits for patients. We intend to build on our expertise in design, optimization and manufacturing to further develop the Synthetic Biotic platform as a reproducible and scalable engine for generating a pipeline of innovative product candidates that address a broad range of diseases. We have established a technology collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks, a privately held high-throughput synthetic biology company, to enable the discovery of new living medicines.
 Protect and Leverage Our Intellectual Property Portfolio and Patents. We believe that we have a broad intellectual property portfolio that includes patents and patent applications relevant to the engineering, development, manufacturing and formulation of human therapeutic products based on synthetic biology and the metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic bacteria. We intend to continue to protect and leverage our intellectual property assets by maintenance and expansion of our worldwide portfolio of intellectual property, including the pursuit of composition of matter and other intellectual property focused on our Synthetic Biotic programs and our technology platform. 
Our Focus: Living Medicines 
 Our novel proprietary Synthetic Biotic discovery and development platform combines synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to re-design the genetic circuitry of beneficial non-pathogenic microbes, including probiotic bacteria, and generate living medicines.

We believe living medicines have unique advantages as potential therapeutics. Living cells can carry out functions that cannot be performed by many conventional drug treatments, such as small molecules or antibodies. In contrast to conventional therapeutics that largely engage a single target and address one molecular dysfunction, living medicines can be designed to dynamically sense diseased environments and respond with a programmed and combinatorial effect compensating for the dysfunction of entire processes or pathways missing in disease. Moreover, a living medicine can also function “catalytically,” since a single living cell can carry out multiple cycles of the intended therapeutic activity during its time in the patient. Synthetic Biotic medicines can be designed to sense a local disease context within a patient’s body and to respond by metabolizing toxic substances or delivering combinations of therapeutic factors. 
 Leveraging Synthetic Biology and Metabolic Engineering of Non-Pathogenic Bacteria to Produce Living Medicines 
 Non-Pathogenic Bacteria. Bacteria is isolated from the human microbiota and widely used as supplements that are believed to provide health benefits. Bacteria have evolved over millions of years to adapt, survive, and carry out active metabolism in many different environments. They are also amenable to genetic manipulation. To confer a therapeutic effect, we leverage basic biological properties of bacteria and tools of synthetic biology to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines.
 Using Synthetic Biology to Generate Synthetic Biotic Medicines. Our scientists genetically engineer a beneficial non-pathogenic bacterium with “wiring” or biological circuits to direct cellular biological processes in a manner analogous to designing electrical circuits. The critical parts of an engineered Synthetic Biotic medicine include (1) the chassis, or non-pathogenic bacterium, (2) the effector module, which is a gene or pathway encoding the core biological activity that provides the therapeutic function, and (3) tunable switches to precisely determine the circumstances under which the effector module will be activated, as well as the potency, performance and output of the effectors themselves. We aim to precisely and appropriately control the amount, location and activity of our Synthetic Biotic medicines to address specific diseases. 
Schematic of the Synthetic Biotic Platform Components: Chassis, Effector, Switch

(1) The Chassis: Our Synthetic Biotic platform currently employs well-characterized bacteria used as probiotics to serve as the chassis upon which we build our living medicines. Our initial programs use E. coli Nissle, which is one of many non-pathogenic strains isolated from the human microbiota. E. coli Nissle is non-colonizing in the GI and has been used as a probiotic bacterial supplement for the last 20 years to promote gut health.  Clinical studies have demonstrated that E.coli Nissle is rapidly cleared from most individuals with no significant safety issues (Clin. Transl. Sci. (2017) 00, 1—8). We also observed similar rates of clearance from subjects in our recent Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers (Sci. Transl. Med. 2019: Vol. 11, Issue 475, eaau7975). We believe E. coli Nissle’s widespread use as a probiotic is evidence of its utility as a safe background chassis to apply synthetic biology to confer a therapeutic benefit.  E. coli Nissle’s metabolic systems and its genetic and metabolic machinery are well understood and provide a robust cellular context into which genetic information can be introduced with high efficiency and little or no damage to the fitness of the bacterium. In addition, the advanced nature of the synthetic biology toolkit available for E. coli Nissle enables rapid iterative design, assembly, and testing of prototype product candidates and remains unique among other bacterial and cellular engineering approaches.
 (2) Building the Effector Module or Circuit: Synthetic Biotic medicines have the advantage that they can be designed with multiple pathway components. We have developed proprietary integration systems to direct stable insertion of multiple genetic circuits and pathways into optimal chromosomal locations, or “landing pads,” of E. coli Nissle. This enables efficient and stable expression of multiple genes encoding enzymes and other proteins. These activities may be further improved for therapeutic effect when combined or when under the control of tunable switches that determine when the mechanisms should be activated.  Our Synthetic Biotic platform allows us to engineer two types of mechanistic activities into our Synthetic Biotic medicines: we can engineer living medicines that act as engines capable of metabolic transformations that can substitute or compensate for missing or defective pathways in a patient, and we can also engineer living medicines to produce therapeutically beneficial molecules. We have leveraged proprietary tools, know-how and intellectual property to build multiple Synthetic Biotic lead strains that produce therapeutically relevant effects in preclinical experiments. Progression of these strains as product candidates in diseases with high unmet need is based on prioritizing those with feasible drug development paths in terms of availability of informative animal models and existence of biomarkers to guide efficient clinical development. 
 (3) Tunable Switches: We also design and engineer proprietary switches to mediate the activity of the new pathways we introduce into our Synthetic Biotic medicines, with the goal of controlling the engineered circuit or its therapeutic output. To optimize the fitness of a Synthetic Biotic strain, it is critical that the effector is activated only at the appropriate time and place. The switches are based on engineering DNA elements called “inducible promoters” that are designed to sense and respond to disease states, specific environmental signals, or exogenously added inducing molecules. Our goal is to design and develop Synthetic Biotic medicines programmed with switches to produce therapeutic effects at precisely the right time and location such as the anaerobic environment of the gut, or in the context of local inflammation or other pathogenic factors.

Advantages of Our Synthetic Biotic Drug Development Platform and Synthetic Biotic Living Medicines
 We believe our platform has the potential to provide safe and effective therapies for patients given several attributes of our Synthetic Biotic approach: 
 Unique Mechanisms to Treat Systemic Metabolic and Immune Dysfunction 
 Synthetic Biotic medicines may be programmed with entire pathways to degrade unwanted molecules or produce those that are beneficial. We believe metabolic pathway complementation is advantageous as compared to gene, RNA or enzyme replacement therapies that are limited to targeting a single gene or protein defect and may require several unique drug products to address genetically heterogeneous patient populations. By compensating with an entire pathway, Synthetic Biotic medicines may provide a therapeutic solution to broader disease populations as a single engineered therapeutic. We believe that our approach has advantages for the treatment of metabolic diseases, GI and immune disorders versus those other modalities that may be limited by delivery, transduction efficiency, duration of therapeutic expression and unclear potential for long-term dosing. 
 
Synthetic Biotic medicines can also be designed to consume or produce metabolites or secrete and display proteins that may shift the tumor microenvironment of the immune system towards anti-tumor activity. 
 Local Therapeutic Delivery: Production of One or More Effectors at the Site of Disease
We believe that when delivered locally, Synthetic Biotic medicines have the potential to avoid the risks of dose-limiting side effects often associated with systemic therapies, especially when combinations of systemic therapies are required. 
 Our Synthetic Biotic programs for rare metabolic diseases are designed to be dosed orally, and act locally while transiting through the gut and, as a consequence, decrease toxic metabolite levels in the blood, thereby providing a systemic therapeutic benefit to the patient. This approach is well suited to regulate the amount of a metabolic byproduct in a patient’s body, particularly when there is unconstrained metabolite flux between the systemic circulation and the gut. Given the potential for chronic oral dosing, Synthetic Biotic medicines may have benefits in terms of dose prediction and reversibility of activity. 
 Currently, many complex diseases, such as inflammatory and autoimmune indications and cancer, require that patients are treated systemically with a combination of therapeutic agents, often resulting in poor tolerability, multiple adverse events and increased cost of therapy. Combinations of cytokine, antibody and protein therapies have potential for great benefit, but can be restricted by dose-limiting side effects when administered systemically. Our approach is to leverage the adaptability of E. coli Nissle to enable the combination of multiple activities into one therapy, which therefore could have greater efficacy while avoiding the toxic negative impact of multiple systemic therapies. We believe that the potential to program the control of expression of one or more proteins at the local disease site represents a unique approach to targeted therapy. We have also developed approaches to enhance the secretion of protein effectors to the extracellular environment. We are developing Synthetic Biotic medicines with the potential to normalize function of a dysregulated immune system. For example, in the case of inflammatory conditions, Synthetic Biotic medicines may be programmed to detect inflammation and respond with the production of one or more anti-inflammatory molecules. In oncology, our programs are being designed to produce effectors to promote immune system activity against a tumor. These activities may further be combined with mechanisms that target tumor metabolism. By incorporating multiple actions, Synthetic Biotic medicines have the potential to address complex diseases while avoiding the risk of systemic toxicity and reducing development costs associated with combining systemic therapies. 
 
Ability to Tune and Enhance Efficacy in Context of Disease 
 Our Synthetic Biotic platform includes a suite of switches to permit precise control of the timing and amount of therapeutic effect produced. Synthetic Biotic therapies may be designed such that they are activated to produce the desired effect in a particular disease environment, such as sites of inflammation. This tuning has the potential to increase the therapeutic window by increasing the margin between the level of medicine needed for efficacy relative to the risk of systemic toxic side effects.

Rational Design to Achieve Predictable Drug-like Properties 
 We have demonstrated the ability to move a program from concept to clinical development in as little as three years for our lead programs. Features of our Synthetic Biotic platform enable a highly efficient drug discovery and development process and have the potential to advance product candidates more rapidly and efficiently than is typically possible with other novel or emerging modalities. These include: 

• | Single Strain as Safe Chassis. There are several benefits of employing a single, safe and well-characterized probiotic bacterium such as E. coli Nissle as the background chassis. First, because our lead programs are based on E. coli Nissle, experience can be leveraged broadly across the portfolio, further optimizing the efficiency and reproducibility of discovery, development and manufacturing efforts. Next, the non-colonizing nature of E. coli Nissle can be combined with engineering approaches to optimize safety in terms of impact on the patient and the environment. E. coli Nissle can be engineered to require a specific exogenous nutrient supplement for growth, which limits the ability to replicate in the human body and environment. By controlling replication, we can control the number of cells being administered to a patient, which limits patient-to-patient variability. Also, dependence on an essential nutritional supplement not available in the environment reduces biocontainment risk. Moreover, the risk of a Synthetic Biotic medicine to the environment is further limited given that it is disadvantaged in terms of fitness due to its modifications.

• | Predictive Pharmacology and Biomarkers. Synthetic Biotic programs are designed to achieve a target activity, and the platform supports an iterative design-build-test cycle to improve performance for achieving this target. For example, Synthetic Biotic programs can be optimized by including multiple copies or regulated control of certain genes, by adding transporters for particular substrates or by optimizing enzymes for basic bacterial metabolism. These tools enable rational and iterative engineering cycles in the discovery phase.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Biomarkers as indicators of mechanistic and clinical activity may also be engineered into Synthetic Biotic medicines from the beginning to drive optimization and decision-making. By assessing the activities of our Synthetic Biotic programs in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we can model activity in humans. As we progress through clinical studies, we expect our predictive pharmacology models will be further refined to inform dosing and development decisions for our additional programs. 
  
• | Stability and Manufacturing. Our lead Synthetic Biotic programs have advanced the platform by defining manufacturing processes that can be used for the entire portfolio. Our use of synthetic biology switches permits the precise control of engineered metabolic pathway activation. We use switches to suppress effector activity during manufacturing, enabling development of reproducible processes for generation of biomass and robust, cost-efficient scale up of product candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Manufacturing efforts have demonstrated reproducibility, yield and stability during small, medium and Phase 1 clinical-scale campaigns where we have developed and executed processes to manufacture 3,000 to 5,000 doses of active drug. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement to lease GMP clean-room space from the Azzur Group, LLC. The agreement has expanded our manufacturing capabilities to enable in-house manufacturing of liquid and solid formulations for mid-stage clinical trials of our orally administered and IO Synthetic Biotic medicines. 
 Our Product Pipeline 
 Approach to Selection of Therapeutic Area
 We believe that our Synthetic Biotic platform has potential to address both metabolic and immune-mediated diseases and we are evaluating these medicines at different sites of action via different routes of administration, either orally or via injection. Our approach to selecting our initial metabolic programs was based on the potential of the Synthetic Biotic platform to uniquely address conditions in which there is (1) unmet medical need with (2) well understood biology that is (3) based on an imbalance of a metabolite and (4) where that metabolite is available within or originates from the gut lumen. Additional considerations include the availability of animal models, relevant biomarkers and feasible clinical development paths. Our initial clinical and preclinical programs have been focused on certain rare metabolic diseases and acquired metabolic diseases that share these characteristics. When delivered orally, these Synthetic Biotic medicines are designed to act from the gut to compensate for the dysfunctional metabolic pathway with the intended consequence of reducing systemic levels of the toxic metabolites. We believe that clinical success in these programs will enable us to demonstrate the potential of our oral Synthetic Biotic medicines to address metabolic dysfunction, while bringing meaningful change to lives of patients suffering from these debilitating conditions. Our two lead therapeutic programs are being developed for the treatment of hyperammonemia (SYNB1020) and PKU (SYNB1618). Our early-stage metabolic pipeline includes discovery-stage product candidates for rare metabolic and GI tract diseases.

We are also leveraging our proprietary technology platform to develop Synthetic Biotic medicines to treat a broader range of human diseases, including metabolic diseases, inflammation and cancer. We are developing a portfolio of IO programs capitalizing on the natural immunostimulatory characteristic of our bacterial chassis and using a rational approach to engineer specific effectors to stimulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, alter the tumor microenvironment and to select combinations of relevant mechanisms and treatments to address specific tumor types. 
 
Our Initial Programs: Overview of Rare Metabolic Diseases
 Patients with rare metabolic diseases are born with mutations in certain genes that result in the loss of a necessary enzyme function in an essential metabolic pathway and prevent the body from metabolizing commonly occurring byproducts of digestion. In patients with such diseases, these byproducts can accumulate to toxic levels in the gut and systemically throughout the body to cause serious health consequences, including irreversible neurological dysfunction. Although in some cases diet modification can be beneficial, high unmet medical need remains as there are few current therapeutic treatments. 
 While there are hundreds of genetic conditions that fall into this class, individual disorders are considered orphan diseases, with each disease affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States and fewer than five per 10,000 people in the European Union. This includes diseases such as urea cycle and amino acid metabolism disorders. Many rare metabolic diseases are thought to be underdiagnosed given the rarity of the conditions, potential for infant death and lack of available diagnostics and limited therapies. 
 SYNB1020 for Hyperammonemia: Urea Cycle Disorders and Hepatic Encephalopathy 
 Hyperammonemia is a metabolic condition characterized by an excess of ammonia in the blood. In healthy individuals, ammonia is primarily produced in the intestine as a byproduct of protein metabolism and microbial degradation of nitrogen-containing compounds. Ammonia itself is then converted to urea in the liver and is excreted in urine. However, if the liver’s ability to convert ammonia to urea is compromised, either due to a genetic defect or acquired liver disease, ammonia accumulates in the blood. Elevated blood ammonia levels are toxic to the brain and can have severe consequences including neurologic crises requiring hospitalization, irreversible cognitive damage and death. 
 We believe that because the majority of ammonia is produced in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, an orally administered Synthetic Biotic medicine could be an effective therapeutic to reduce the levels of excess ammonia in the blood of patients with HE and UCDs without the need for severe protein restriction and the risk of systemic toxicities. The FDA granted SYNB1020 orphan drug designation for UCDs in August 2016 and Fast Track designation in June 2017.
 Overview of HE 
 The primary function of the liver is to filter out toxins, particularly ammonia, that are harmful if not correctly metabolized. In patients whose liver function is impaired, these toxins can accumulate in the blood stream and cause organ damage, particularly in the brain, which leads to a decline in brain function that is referred to as HE. Ammonia, a highly toxic substance produced in the body as a byproduct of protein metabolism, plays a key role in the development and prognosis of HE. While ammonia can be minimally metabolized by the brain in patients whose liver function is impaired, excessive ammonia levels can overwhelm the capacity of brain tissue and lead to a greater chance of developing brain swelling, coma and death for patients with HE. It is estimated that 30-45% of patients with chronic liver disease are affected by episodes of HE, and while many HE symptoms can be reversed with appropriate treatment, persistent impairment of memory and learning can occur. 
 HE severity is typically classified as covert or overt based largely on a patient’s mental state. Covert HE is difficult to diagnose and is often observed in patients with cirrhosis who appear to have no obvious disorientation, but who display mild to moderate symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, changes in personality or behavior, and poor sleep. Patients with covert disease are at a higher risk of developing the more severe overt HE and have increasingly been recognized as a cause of morbidity linked with increased risk of traffic accidents and unemployment. Overt HE is associated with obvious mental disorientation and physical symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, tremors, organ failure, or brain swelling, that arise suddenly and may induce a coma or even death, particularly if not adequately treated. Overt HE is associated with a poor prognosis, with one-year survival estimates of 20% to 55%. 
 The current standard of care for overt HE includes lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide that prevents the absorption of ammonia in the gut. Lactulose is associated with GI side effects including both painful abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Non-absorbable antibiotics are also used to treat HE, often concurrently with lactulose. Xifaxan® (rifaximin), a broad-spectrum antibiotic used to reduce growth of bacteria that produce ammonia in the colon, was approved for HE based on improvements in the duration of remission, reduced hospitalizations over six months, and improved quality of life in patients with HE. Although rifaximin and lactulose are used therapeutically for overt HE, there are no approved treatments for covert HE.

Morbidity and mortality associated with overt HE remains high and hospitalizations for HE impose a high burden on community resources. When current therapies fail to control overt HE, patients may be candidates for a potentially curative liver transplantation. There is a need for an effective therapy for patients with HE to reduce episodes of cognitive dysfunction and hospitalizations. 
Overview of UCD 
 UCDs are a group of rare but serious and potentially fatal, genetic diseases. The urea cycle is an enzymatic pathway in which waste nitrogen, produced as a byproduct of protein metabolism, is converted into urea by the liver and eliminated from the body through urine. Patients with a UCD carry a deficiency in one of the six enzymes necessary for completion of the urea cycle, resulting in accumulation of waste nitrogen throughout the body in the form of ammonia, a substance that is highly toxic even in small amounts. 
 
Functional Urea Cycle 
  
 Urea Cycle: The urea cycle is a series of five enzymes as well as transporters and cofactors found primarily and the liver and intestine that are involved in the detoxification of ammonia. A sixth enzyme, N-acetylglutamate synthase (not shown) forms an important precursor for this pathway.  Deficiencies in any of these six enzymes or damage to hepatocytes containing these enzymes can result in the toxic accumulation of ammonia or urea cycle intermediates.
 
UCD patients have intermittent periods of hyperammonemia, the symptoms of which can range from mild (loss of appetite, vomiting, and lethargy) to a severe hyperammonemic crisis associated with long-term cognitive or behavioral impairment, toxic encephalopathy, and even death. Symptoms often depend on the severity of the enzyme deficiency, and patients with the most severe disease present shortly after birth. Hyperammonemia in newborn infants due to UCD could be catastrophic and is associated with 24% mortality. Patients with later onset disease could suffer from a period of hyperammonemia that is often triggered by stress or illness resulting in severe neurological symptoms and associated with a high risk of mortality. 
 While it is difficult to estimate the exact incidence and prevalence of UCD, as it is thought that many patients go undiagnosed, it is estimated that UCD occurs in approximately one in 35,000 births in the United States. Based on analysis of the newborn screening data and demographic data from the UCD Longitudinal Registry Study sponsored by the NIH, we believe the size of the diagnosed prevalent population in the United States to be approximately 2,000 patients and that approximately two-thirds of these patients are under 18 years of age. 
 10


The mainstay of management of UCD is dietary protein restriction. Patients must carefully balance their protein intake to ensure the body receives adequate nutrients for growth and development, while avoiding triggering hyperammonemia. However, varying protein requirements and variable growth and activity levels often elicit episodes of hyperammonemia that can result in irreversible neurological damage. To supplement for the lower protein intake, patients may incorporate amino acid dietary formulations, such as L-citrulline or L-arginine, into their diet. However, dietary management remains challenging, especially in infants and children. 
 The only available drugs, Buphenyl® (sodium phenylbutyrate) and Ravicti® (glycerol phenylbutyrate), are approved for the chronic management of patients with UCD and create an alternate pathway for nitrogen/ammonia elimination from the body, although patients must maintain protein restricted diets. Use of sodium phenylbutyrate is limited by pill burden, taste, and tolerability issues that can make compliance challenging. These therapies are mechanistically similar treatment options with limitations on maximal effect due to dose-related neurological safety issues (e.g., vomiting, nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, or sleepiness) and enzymatic saturation and, therefore, the unmet need remains high. 
 When these management approaches fail to control chronic UCD-induced hyperammonemia, patients may be candidates for liver transplantation, which is potentially curative as it may correct the enzyme deficiency that causes UCD. However, transplants are limited by availability of donor organs, are associated with potentially life-threatening risks and require life-long suppression of the immune system. Ultimately, morbidity and mortality remain high in UCD, and patients continue to suffer hyperammonemic crises. We believe that a truly transformative therapy for UCD would be an effective oral medicine without systemic toxicity that will maintain blood ammonia concentrations at a safe level while allowing patients to eat a normal or only moderately restricted diet. 
 
SYNB1020 Design 
 SYNB1020 is an orally administered, engineered strain of E. coli Nissle. SYNB1020 was designed to complement the missing or deficient enzyme functions in patients with hyperammonemia with an enhanced pathway to consume ammonia. This mechanism has applicability in liver disease where there is a need to reduce excess ammonia in the colon before it can be absorbed into the blood and cause HE episodes as well as the potential to treat the spectrum of enzyme deficiencies that underlie UCD. 
 Our approach was to create a Synthetic Biotic medicine that would continuously consume excess ammonia where it is naturally produced in the colon and produce arginine. Arginine production is deficient in UCD patients due to a defect in the urea cycle, and patients are often treated with arginine supplements. E. coli Nissle has an endogenous arginine production pathway that uses four molecules of ammonia for every new molecule of arginine produced. We modified this pathway to significantly enhance arginine production. 
 A detailed description of  the engineering of SYNB1020, data from preclinical studies in animal models of disease and healthy non-human primates as well as data from our clinical study of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers was published in January 2019 (Sci. Transl. Med. 2019:Vol. 11, Issue 475, eaau7975).
 In summary, we have demonstrated in in vitro studies, that SYNB1020 consumes ammonia and produces arginine at substantially higher rates compared with a control strain of E. coli Nissle that had not been engineered. 
 In an animal model of hyperammonemia, the spf-ash/F1 mouse, we observed a dose-dependent decrease in blood ammonia in mice fed a high protein diet that received orally administered SYNB1020 compared to heat inactivated SYNB1020 at the highest dose. This reduction in blood ammonia resulted in improved survival of animals dosed with SYNB1020, compared to animals given the heat-inactivated control. Similar data demonstrating reduction in blood ammonia with SYNB1020 administration have been generated in both a mouse model (the thioacetamide, or TAA model) and in the rat bile duct ligation model of liver damage.
 
SYNB1020 Clinical Development Plan 
 In June 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and gastrointestinal clearance of single and multiple doses of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers. In November 2017, we announced top-line data that demonstrated that SYNB1020 was safe and achieved proof-of-mechanism. The Phase 1 trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of orally administered SYNB1020 evaluating ascending doses each administered on a single day and multiple ascending doses administered over 14 days. The primary objective of the trial was to assess safety and tolerability of SYNB1020 in healthy volunteers. Secondary objectives were to characterize the microbial kinetics of SYNB1020 in feces as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and gastrointestinal tolerability assessed by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale. Exploratory endpoints were designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of SYNB1020, including measurements of blood ammonia levels and other related biomarkers. 
 11


Fifty-two healthy volunteers were dosed orally with either SYNB1020 or placebo (ratio three to one), including 28 in seven cohorts in the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the study and 24 subjects in three cohorts of the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial. Complete safety results from the SAD and MAD Phase 1 trials demonstrate that SYNB1020 was well tolerated at doses of up to 5x1011 CFU three times a day for 14 days. Higher doses were associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and vomiting. 
 As expected, we did not observe changes in blood ammonia levels during the trial, as all subjects were healthy volunteers who entered the trial with well-controlled normal blood ammonia levels. In a stable-isotope tracer study in which subjects were orally administered 15N-ammonium chloride, we observed a dose-dependent increase in 15Nitrate, a terminal metabolite of arginine metabolism, in plasma and urine compared to baseline in SYNB1020-treated subjects but not in the placebo group. In subjects treated with the highest dose, the increase in blood and urinary nitrate was statistically-significant compared to placebo-treated subjects. This observation is consistent with SYNB1020’s mechanism of action which converts ammonia into arginine.  In addition, conversion of ammonia into arginine was demonstrated in bacteria collected from the feces of treated subjects but not from placebo treated individuals thus demonstrating SYNB1020 retained activity during transit through the colon.
 In addition to demonstrating that SYNB1020 was active in vivo, we obtained data on the exposure and clearance of SYNB1020 in treated subjects. We observed that amounts of SYNB1020 detected in the feces increased with increasing SYNB1020 dose and that the bacteria behave in a consistent and predictable way with all subjects completely excreting and clearing SYNB1020 from their systems within two weeks after the final dose. 
 SYNB1020 Upcoming Milestones 
 In April 2018, we initiated the first clinical trial of SYNB1020 in patients with cirrhosis as a result of liver disease who had elevated blood ammonia and we expect to have top-line data by mid-2019. Further clinical development of SYNB1020 for conditions resulting in hyperammonemia, including HE and UCDs, will be informed by a number of factors, including data from our Phase 1b / 2a study in patients with cirrhosis.
 SYNB1618 for PKU 
 PKU is a rare metabolic disease caused by a genetic defect in the gene phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) leading to Phe accumulation in the blood and brain, where it is neurotoxic and can lead to neurological deficits and even death. Current disease management of PKU involves dietary protein restriction with the consumption of phenylalanine-free protein supplements. There are currently two approved medications for treatment of PKU:
  
• | Kuvan ® (sapropterin dihydrochloride), an oral medication that is indicated for a subgroup of patients who have some residual PAH activity and does not eliminate the need for ongoing dietary management.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PalynziqTM (pegvaliase-pqpz), an injectable, pegylated, bacterial enzyme (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase or PAL) that metabolizes Phe and that is indicated for treatment of adult patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Despite recommendations supporting life-long control of phenylalanine levels, compliance is challenging due to the highly restrictive nature of the diet, putting patients at risk for cognitive and psychiatric disease and supporting the need for novel treatment approaches. 
 Our Synthetic Biotic platform is well-suited to complement the missing enzyme function in PKU patients by providing alternative metabolic pathways to consume Phe. Our second rare metabolic disease program, SYNB1618 for PKU, is designed to remove excess Phe from the blood by transforming it into non-toxic metabolites. The FDA granted SYNB1618 orphan drug designation for PKU in October 2017 and Fast Track designation in April 2018. 
 Overview of PKU 
 Phe is an essential amino acid that enters the body primarily through dietary protein and can be toxic if not sufficiently broken down and eliminated. The metabolism of Phe by the liver is dependent on adequate function of the liver enzyme PAH and the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) necessary for its activity. When the PAH gene is mutated and/or the production of BH4 is blocked, Phe cannot be sufficiently broken down and accumulates to toxic levels (i.e., hyperphenylalaninemia), which can cause irreversible brain damage. PKU is an inherited metabolic disease that presents as a severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia. 
 12


The disease course of PKU typically involves worsening neurological function that begins in infancy or early childhood. The clinical manifestations vary depending on severity of the enzyme mutation, the time of diagnosis and treatment initiation, and compliance. Symptoms may be extensive, such as severe cognitive impairment, or they may reflect more moderate neurocognitive or physical issues, such as below average intelligence, behavioral or mood disorders, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, decreased motor function, eczema, body odor, and tremors or seizures. A woman with PKU who becomes pregnant could develop maternal PKU if her diet is not strictly controlled, and there is a risk that the baby will be born with one or more birth defects such as cognitive impairment, microcephaly or congenital heart disease. 
 Based on the success of newborn screening efforts that began in developed countries in the 1960s, it is believed that nearly all PKU patients under the age of 40 have been diagnosed at birth. The National PKU Alliance estimates that in the United States there are currently 16,500 people living with PKU. 
 Currently, management of PKU requires a heavily modified diet that restricts protein intake, combined with essential amino acid and vitamin supplementation. Special medical foods, including phenylalanine-free protein formula, provide patients with dietary protein and fulfill other nutrient needs. However, it is challenging for most PKU patients to adhere to the restricted diet to the level that provides the necessary control of phenylalanine levels even with the efforts of supportive family and social networks. Patients often have trouble adhering to the diet, with particular challenges arising during times of increasing independence during adolescence. Furthermore, access to low protein foods can be challenging, as they are costlier and less nutritious than their higher protein, non-modified counterparts. 
 Kuvan® (sapropterin dihydrochloride) was the first drug approved for the treatment of PKU in 2007. It is indicated for the reduction of blood phenylalanine in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia with residual PAH activity as it is a synthetic form of the BH4 cofactor. Oral administration of Kuvan, along with protein restriction, has lowered phenylalanine levels in patients who have residual PAH activity and/or mild forms of the disease, which accounts for approximately 20-50% of the PKU population. However, Kuvan does not eliminate the need for ongoing dietary management in all patients. Large neutral amino acids have also demonstrated activity in blocking absorption of excess phenylalanine by the intestines and brain but are currently only administered in adolescents and adults. 
 PaylnziqTM (pegvaliase-pqpz), a pegylated form of recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), an enzyme that metabolizes phenylalanine but does not require cofactor activity, was approved by the FDA in 2018. While daily Palynziq injections have been proven to lower phenylalanine levels, many patients experience injection site reactions and/or develop antibodies to the product
. A Black Box warning of a risk of anaphylaxis is included on the Palynziq label and Palynziq is currently only indicated for adult patients. Other therapeutics in early development include various gene therapy approaches, modified cell therapies and a modified orally delivered enzyme replacement therapy.
 Despite recent improvements in PKU therapy, patients continue to suffer from poor outcomes. Even patients who are diagnosed and treated early have increased risk of neurocognitive abnormalities and psychiatric complications and are burdened by the life-long struggle to comply with strict dietary modifications. Available drug therapies demonstrate limited effectiveness, are accompanied by immunologic and other toxicities, and may still require patients to maintain a heavily restricted diet. We believe a truly transformative therapy would be orally-dosed and provide sustained, safe concentrations of phenylalanine while allowing for a normal or only moderately restricted diet. We believe that a Synthetic Biotic medicine could be an effective oral therapeutic that acts from the gut to consume excess phenylalanine with the consequent effect of reducing levels in the blood without the need for severe phenylalanine restriction or risk of systemic toxicities. 
 SYNB1618 Design 
 SYNB1618 is a genetically-modified strain of E. coli Nissle engineered to express a synthetic pathway for transporting and metabolizing Phe in patients with PKU following oral administration. SYNB1618 was designed to overcome the missing enzyme function in patients with PKU with complementary pathways to reduce phenylalanine levels. 
 In designing SNYB1618, we integrated genes, including a form of the PAL enzyme that converts phenylalanine to the non-toxic byproduct trans cinnamic acid (TCA), which is then converted in the liver to hippurate (HA) and excreted in the urine. TCA and HA function as useful biomarkers of SYNB1618 activity in vivo. A detailed description of  the engineering of SYNB1618 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in September 2018 (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 857–864 (2018)).

SYNB1618 Nonclinical Program 
 Preclinical Efficacy Studies 
 In vivo studies in a mouse model of PKU (enu2-/-) demonstrated that urinary HA concentrations increased in a dose-dependent fashion in SYNB1618-treated mice compared to mice treated with an unengineered E. coli Nissle control that did not have the phenylalanine degradation pathway. We also observed that subcutaneous injection of mice on a Phe-restricted diet with phenylalanine resulted in a rapid increase in blood phenylalanine concentrations. The increase associated with this phenylalanine challenge was significantly blunted upon oral administration of SYNB1618 compared to administration of the non-engineered control strain.  Similar data were generated with SYNB1618 in healthy non-human primates. With increasing oral doses of SYNB1618, we observed increasing levels of plasma TCA and urinary HA demonstrating that SYNB1618 is functional in the primate gut.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that SYNB1618 has activity in the GI tract and can decrease blood Phe levels by degradation of recirculating phenylalanine, as well as dietary Phe. A detailed description of  the engineering of SYNB1618 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in September 2018 (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 857–864 (2018)). SYNB1618 Clinical Development Plan 
 In April 2018, we initiated a Phase 1 / 2a, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and gastrointestinal clearance of SYNB1618. We treated healthy adult volunteers with single- or multiple-ascending doses of SYNB1618 and are currently evaluating SYNB1618 in cohorts of patients with PKU. 
 Primary endpoints of the study were safety, tolerability and identification of a suitable dose to evaluate in patients with PKU. In addition, exploratory endpoints were designed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of SYNB1618, including production of previously identified biomarkers related to SYNB1618 activity, TCA in plasma and HA in urine, and to provide mechanistic and clinical insights in both healthy volunteers and patients with PKU. 
 Fifty-six healthy volunteers were dosed orally with either SYNB1618 or placebo (ratio three to one), including 24 in six cohorts in the SAD portion of the study and 32 subjects in three cohorts of the MAD portion of the trial. In September 2017, we announced top-line data demonstrating that in healthy volunteers SYNB1618 was safe and well tolerated at doses up to 2x1011 CFU three times a day for seven days. Higher doses were associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and vomiting. The data also demonstrated proof-of-mechanism for SYNB1618. 
 During the treatment part of the study, subjects were housed in a clinical unit and provided a defined diet. The activity of SYNB1618 was evaluated in fasted subjects in both the SAD and MAD cohorts after administration of a standardized breakfast drink containing a defined amount of protein. At one dose level in the SAD portion of the study, solid food containing an equivalent amount of protein was substituted for the liquid meal. In addition, a labeled Phe tracer (D5-Phe) was orally administered. Blood and urine were collected over a subsequent six-hour period and several metabolites were measured including Phe and SYNB1618-specific biomarkers of Phe metabolism, TCA in blood and HA in urine. This was conducted in the SAD cohorts on the day of dosing and in the MAD cohorts on Day -1 (baseline) and Day 7 (the last day of dosing).
 A statistically significant dose-dependent increase in both plasma TCA and urinary HA was observed in SYNB1618-treated subjects but not in those treated with placebo.  Production of metabolites from Phe administered as a free amino acid was similar to Phe administered as whole protein. In addition, production of metabolites was similar whether the protein was administered as a liquid or as a solid meal. In healthy volunteers, who all have normal Phe metabolism, there was no impact on blood Phe levels.  All healthy volunteers enrolled in the study cleared SYNB1618 from their GI tracts within the expected timeframe
 SYNB1618 Upcoming Milestones 
 The Phase 1/2a trial is ongoing and we are currently evaluating single and multiple doses of SYNB1618 in patients with PKU. The primary endpoints of the study are safety and tolerability. In addition, while the study was not designed to demonstrate and effect on Phe lowering it will enable evaluation of the pharmacodynamic effects of SYNB1618, including production of TCA in plasma and HA in urine in order to characterize the kinetics of SYNB1618 and to provide mechanistic and clinical insights in patients with PKU. We expect to have data in mid-2019.

Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Rare Metabolic, GI and Immune Disorders with High Unmet Needs
The design, preclinical research, clinical planning and scalable manufacturing of our lead programs have already informed development of future clinical candidates. Our initial programs were selected based on applicability of the Synthetic Biotic platform to provide pathway complementation in rare metabolic diseases in which the toxic metabolite was known to be associated with the relevant clinical endpoint and to be accessible in the GI tract. Additional examples in which there is opportunity to expand the potential of Synthetic Biotic medicines include discovery-stage programs for rare metabolic, GI and immune disorders with high unmet needs. 
Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Broader Metabolic Disease 
 Our Synthetic Biotic platform combined with our product discovery and development capabilities drive the potential for multiple clinically meaningful opportunities for patients affected by a broad set of metabolic diseases of the liver and central nervous system. For these indications, there is need for a safe, oral therapies with local activity in the gut to reset a metabolic dysfunction. 
Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Immunomodulation 
 Our Synthetic Biotic platform has the potential to generate clinically meaningful therapies for patients affected by immune-mediated diseases. 
 Our Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Immuno-Oncology (IO)
 We believe boosting the body’s immune response against tumor cells is one of the most promising advances in the treatment of cancer. The so-called “hot tumors”, those with robust immune cell infiltration, specifically by T cells, have responded well to immunotherapies such as the PD-1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors work by blocking pathways that inhibit T cells thus enabling them to recognize and destroy the tumor. Checkpoint inhibitors have significantly extended the lives of patients with several cancer types and, in some cases, have resulted in complete clinical responses. However, a large proportion of tumors are “cold” (i.e., they lack T cells), and respond poorly to current immunotherapy. 
 Our goal is to leverage our Synthetic Biotic platform to design living medicines that can engage multiple immunomodulatory pathways to enhance tumor inflammation and promote robust T cell responses enabling broad tumor response and remission. We believe that such medicines have the potential to expand the patient population that could benefit from immunotherapy. Our approach is designed to deliver robust therapeutic combinations directly to the tumors, without significant systemic exposure. Synthetic Biotic medicines are being developed to be administered by an intra-tumor injection or, in the case of GI cancers, by oral administration and can be engineered to perform three types of functions: metabolic conversions (consumption of an immune-suppressive metabolite or production of an immuno-activating metabolite, secretions or bacterial surface display of proteins (cytokines, chemokines, receptor ligands), and secretion or bacterial surface display of specific single chain antibody domains, known as scFv. 
 We believe our Synthetic Biotic platform can be deployed in a rational, mechanistic way, and can deliver multiple validated mechanisms to elicit specific immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Our main mechanistic areas of focus in the context of tumor immunology include: 
  
• | Immune activation and priming: Our bacterial Synthetic Biotic chassis is predicted to engage innate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, thereby initiating an immune cascade to activate and direct T cells to the tumor. Lack of effective presentation of tumor-specific antigens to T cells is recognized as a significant limitation to the initiation of immune responses in tumors. We are building and optimizing Synthetic Biotics medicines with the potential of addressing this issue. For example, our first Synthetic Biotic development program is SYNB1891, an engineered E.coli Nissle designed to produce a STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) agonist while taking advantage of the chassis effect. The STING pathway plays a critical role in the control of tumor growth at both steady state and following a variety of cytolytic and immune-based therapies by initiating an antitumor immune response and driving tumor regression. SYNB1891 can be delivered directly into the tumor enabling its localized site of action in the tumor microenvironment. The approach of using intra-tumoral injection elicits STING activation in the tumor but not systematically, potentially decreasing the risk of adverse events that may arise from the production of systemic interferon. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Immune augmentation/Reversal of immunosuppression: We have developed strains that actively consume and transform immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, with the goal of setting up a milieu conducive to immune activation and tumor destruction. For example, we have built Synthetic Biotic candidates that consume kynurenine to reprogram the tumor microenvironment and to enable recognition of the tumor by the adaptive immune system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


 
• | T cell expansion: Tumor antigen-specific T cell expansion and prevention of exhaustion are recognized as key objectives for successful cancer immunotherapy. We are developing Synthetic Biotic medicines programs to secrete specific cytokines and scFvs to promote T cell survival and expansion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stromal modulation: The physical structure of tumors is receiving increasing attention as emerging data demonstrate its importance in orchestrating tumor growth, immune evasion and resistance to chemotherapy, such as in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Tumor-derived extracellular matrix proteins can limit the perfusion of drugs or antibodies, contributing to the remarkable resistance of this tumor type to therapy. We have developed strains that secrete active enzymes with the capacity to remodel extracellular matrix proteins to make the tumor more permeable.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our product vision for immuno-oncology is to use a rational approach to selecting and combining relevant mechanisms of action for the microenvironment of specific tumor types. For example, in animal models we are evaluating Synthetic Biotic medicines that combine the antigen release, activation and priming activities of a STING agonist with the immune augmentation and T cell expansion effects of kynurenine consumption. In early studies with intra-tumoral administration, in preclinical mouse models, we have observed high rates of durable response with evidence of an effect not only on the treated tumor, but also a shrinking of tumors outside the scope of the localized treatment (abscopal effect), while avoiding systemic toxicity. 
 In 2018, we selected SYNB1891 as our first Synthetic Biotic IO development candidate and are advancing it through IND-enabling studies. We expect to file an IND application for SYNB1891 in the second half of 2019.
 Our Synthetic Biotic Medicines for Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
 Among immune conditions, IBD is particularly attractive for our Synthetic Biotic platform, as it allows us to leverage knowledge and expertise gleaned from our metabolic programs to develop living medicines that can act locally at the site of disease in the gut. Because our approach is based on local delivery to the site of inflammation and not on systemic administration, we anticipate that our Synthetic Biotic medicines may offer an attractive safety profile in this setting. In 2015, we entered into a multi-year global collaboration with AbbVie focused on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. In June 2017 and September 2018, we announced the achievement of the first and second milestones, respectively in this collaboration.
 IBD is a group of diseases characterized by significant local inflammation in the GI tract typically driven by T cells, activated macrophages and compromised function of the epithelial barrier. IBD pathogenesis is linked to both genetic and environmental factors and may be caused by altered interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system. Current approaches to treat IBD are focused on therapeutics that modulate the immune system and suppress inflammation. These therapies include steroids, such as prednisone, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, such as Humira® (adalimumab). However, these approaches are associated with systemic immunosuppression, which includes greater susceptibility to infectious diseases and cancer. It is estimated that between 1.0-1.3 million patients have IBD in the United States. 
 Compromised gut barrier function also plays a central role in autoimmune diseases pathogenesis. A single layer of epithelial cells separates the luminal contents of the gut from the host circulatory system and the immune cells in the body. Disrupting the epithelial layer can lead to pathological exposure of foreign antigens from the lumen resulting in increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. The interplay between the gut microbiota and the host is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier as well as homeostatic immunity. Thus, enhancing barrier function and reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract are potential therapeutic mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. Our Synthetic Biotic platform allows for the effective programming of E. coli Nissle to execute these functions, including the metabolic production of factors such short chain fatty acids to enhance barrier function, and secreting proteins, such as immunomodulatory cytokines. 
Collaboration Agreements 
 To accelerate the development and commercialization of Synthetic Biotic medicines to patients, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic alliances with collaborators that can expand our pipeline of therapeutic development and product candidates. We also work, and intend to seek additional opportunities to work, with multiple academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities to deepen our understanding and development of living medicines with the potential to treat disease and disorders.

AbbVie 
 In July 2015, we entered into a license agreement with our subsidiary Synlogic IBDCo, Inc. (IBDCo) and an Agreement and Plan of Merger with AbbVie (together, the AbbVie Agreements) to collaborate on the discovery and development of Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. The AbbVie Agreements provide AbbVie with an exclusive option to acquire IBDCo, which would then have an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize up to three specified Synthetic Biotic medicines for the treatment of IBD. 
 Under the terms of the collaboration with AbbVie, we have the responsibility to discover, characterize and optimize one lead Synthetic Biotic product candidate to the point of an IND-enabling package, together with two backup product candidates, through a research and development program covering a limited number of effectors that modulate the IBD pathophysiology. The multi-year collaboration combines AbbVie’s expertise in inflammatory diseases with our expertise in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. AbbVie agreed to pay IBDCo an upfront payment of $2.0 million, received in December 2015, and up to $16.5 million upon the achievement of certain research milestones. 
 In May 2017, IBDCo achieved the first of these research milestones under the AbbVie Agreements for which it received $2.0 million. On September 27, 2018, AbbVie and the Company signed an amendment (the Second Amendment) to the AbbVie Agreements. The Second Amendment clarified the requirements necessary to complete the second phase which resulted in additional time and effort in the second phase of the research plan.  Additionally, the Second Amendment split the next milestone payment under the AbbVie Agreements into two payments: a milestone payment of $2.0 million earned by the Company upon execution of the Second Amendment and the remaining milestone payment of the balance due upon the successful achievement of specified research and pre-clinical events and the advancement to the third phase of the research plan.
 On December 18, 2018, AbbVie and the Company signed an amendment (the Third Amendment) to the AbbVie Agreements. The Third Amendment provides that in the event AbbVie determines that it is necessary to enter into license agreements with certain third parties in a particular country or other jurisdiction which, but for such license, would be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of any product governed by the AbbVie Agreements, AbbVie would be entitled to deduct certain expenses related to such license agreements from particular payments made to the Company. 
 If AbbVie accepts our IND-enabling package covering the lead Synthetic Biotic product candidate, AbbVie may exercise its exclusive option to acquire IBDCo, which would house the lead and two backup product candidates. If this option is exercised, AbbVie would pay us an option exercise fee upon the closing of the IBDCo merger and we would be eligible to receive future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, and low single digit royalties on sales of the Synthetic Biotic medicines. In addition, AbbVie would then assume full control of all further clinical development and commercial activity, including responsibility for all expenses and decisions. 
 Potential Future Collaborations 
 We view strategic partnerships as important drivers for helping accelerate our goal of effectively treating patients, and we will continue to seek strategic alliances with collaborators who can help fund, develop and commercialize our novel therapeutic development and product candidates, particularly in large metabolic indications and immuno-oncology. As the potential application of our Synthetic Biotics platform is extremely broad, we also plan to continue to identify academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities that can contribute expertise and resources to our programs, to allow us to more rapidly expand our impact to broader patient populations.

The intellectual property licensed from MIT and BU related to genetic circuitry (designed to be modular components for integration into biological systems), cells containing the genetic circuitry, and methods and systems for gene regulation using the genetic circuitry. 
 During 2018, we determined our growing portfolio of internally generated intellectual property superseded the in-licensed intellectual property in the BU license and the MIT license. Accordingly, on December 18, 2018, we provided notice to terminate the license agreements with MIT and BU/MIT. The BU license will be terminated effective February 16, 2019 and the MIT license will be terminated effective June 19, 2019.

General Considerations
 Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to account for delays in prosecution at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and/or to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. For regulatory delays, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of synthetic biology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. For additional risks, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”. 
 
Trademarks 
 Our registered trademark portfolio currently contains 14 registered trademarks, and eight pending applications

 Generally, we seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. In some circumstances, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology, trade secrets and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that company employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property”. 
Regulatory Matters 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application (BLA), process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 19


U.S. Drug Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and implementing regulations. Our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as biologics. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to GLP other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials according to GCP to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | development and approval of a companion diagnostic device if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with GMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. In June 2016, the FDA issued an updated guidance for the industry entitled “Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products: Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Information,” which included recommendations from the FDA regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND for early clinical trials with live biotherapeutic products. This Guidance reflects the FDA’s thinking on a topic at the time that it was issued and although it is not binding on the FDA or a sponsor, it provided us with additional information about what should be included in our IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An institutional review board (IRB) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
 
20


Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. However, there are evolving rules and increasing requirements for publication of all trial related information, and it is possible that data and other information from trials involving drugs that never garner approval could require disclosure in the future.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical and other nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of a significant user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including where the biologic has been designated as an orphan drug. The FDA reviews all BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in depth substantive review. The FDA may refer the BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA, or an approval letter following satisfactory completion of all aspects of the review process. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. 
 BLAs receive either standard or priority review. A drug representing a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease may receive priority review. Priority review for an original BLA will be six months from the date that the BLA is filed. In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled Phase 4 clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 22


The Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most newly approved drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original BLAs and supplements thereto, must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. Orphan indications are exempt from PREA. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments). The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of its currently-owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is a type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), an additional six months of marketing exclusivity may be available if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. If a written request does not include clinical trials in neonates, the FDA is required to include its rationale for not requesting those clinical trials. The FDA may request studies on approved or unapproved indications in separate written requests. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received any written requests. 
 Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), which included the BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for two types of “generic” biologics, biosimilars and interchangeable biologic products, and provides for a 12-year data exclusivity period for the first approved biological product, or reference product, against which a biosimilar or interchangeable application is evaluated; however if pediatric clinical trials are performed and accepted by the FDA, the 12-year data exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. Because our product candidates will be regulated as biologics, if they are approved, they may be subject to competition from biosimilars. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically-inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. 
 The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency. 
 An application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted until four years after the date on which the reference product was first approved. The first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed, but the exclusivity period may be shortened under certain circumstances. 
 23


Orphan Drug Designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of orphan product exclusivity, except in very limited circumstances. The FDA will not recognize orphan drug exclusive approval if a sponsor fails to demonstrate upon approval that the drug is clinically superior to a previously approved drug, regardless of whether or not the approved drug was designated an orphan drug or had orphan drug exclusivity. Thus orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. 
 In August 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for SYNB1020 for the treatment of UCDs. In October 2017, the FDA granted SYNB1618 orphan drug designation for the treatment of PKU. 
 Expedited Review and Approval 
 The FDA has various programs, including Fast-Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast-Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-BLA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of BLA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Although Fast-Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast-Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides approval of drugs that treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker trial. 
 A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end of Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within 60 days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all Fast-Track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1.
 In June 2017, the FDA granted Fast-Track designation for the use of SYNB1020 for the treatment of UCDs. 
 In April 2018, the FDA granted Fast-Track designation for the use of SYNB1618 for the treatment of PKU.
 24


Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP and other laws and regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product. 
 25


Reimbursement 
 Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of our products. Our product candidates may not be considered cost effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. 
 Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B-covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price, which is regularly updated. We believe that our product candidates that are intended to be administered intratumorally will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules. 
 
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the ACA enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA has been under scrutiny by the U.S. Congress almost since its passage, and certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. As a result, its longevity continues to be uncertain. In addition, ongoing initiatives in the U.S. have increased and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing. The announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product candidate that we may successfully develop. 
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on our profitability placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. We contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes.

Manufacturing 
 We have made and continue to make significant investments to develop manufacturing processes designed to allow us to reproducibly manufacture high quality living medicines at clinical scale and, later, at commercial scale to enable approval of our product candidates. We have an internal development group and have recently expanded our manufacturing and process development capabilities with the lease of GMP cleanroom space in Waltham, Massachusetts. This facility enables us to produce clinical trial material for early to mid-stage studies of our rare metabolic disease and IO programs. We continue to build the organization to support scale-up and development towards commercialization. We currently expect to continue to work with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for production of late-stage clinical trial material. 
 Clinical trial material for our Phase 1 studies of SYNB1020 for hyperammonemia and SYNB1618 for PKU were manufactured by a CMO. These first clinical trials used a liquid formulation. We have invested in the development of a solid dose oral formulation for later stage clinical development and commercial use. 
 To enable the production of high levels of cells, or biomass, we can engineer our Synthetic Biotic medicines with switches. These switches are comprised of transcription factor and promoter pairs that allow for controlled expression of the therapeutic effectors produced by our Synthetic Biotic medicines. To ensure the metabolic capacity of the cells is allotted to the production of a high level of biomass during manufacturing, the effector circuits in the Synthetic Biotic programs are not expressed during this growth phase. At the end of the manufacturing process, the circuits are then induced, or activated. This two-step approach was designed to enable a high level of biomass production as well as to deliver the required activity necessary at the time of administration. 
 As we progress in clinical development, we will need to increase our scale and eventually to commercial-scale manufacturing. We are in the process of assessing CMOs who meet our criteria to supply our later-stage clinical development and commercial supply. We will compare the merits of working with one or more CMOs who meet our criteria with the possibility of building GMP manufacturing capacity and capabilities internally. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic bacteria, our clinical development expertise, and strong intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use synthetic biology or cell therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more conventional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in accessing technologies to enable our programs. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Competitors to our efforts to provide living medicines to patients with a wide range of indications include other synthetic biology companies developing other synthetic biology methods, cellular and microbiome-based companies, DNA and RNA-based companies, as well as companies developing small molecules or other biologics. In the case of indications that we are targeting with our own Synthetic Biotic medicines, competitors include, but are not limited to:

Corporate Information and History 
 We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2007 under the name “Mirna Therapeutics, Inc.” We carry on our business directly and through our subsidiaries. 
 Our subsidiary, Synlogic Operating Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware as TMC Therapeutics, Inc. on March 14, 2014. On July 15, 2014, TMC Therapeutics, Inc. changed its name to Synlogic, Inc. (Private Synlogic when referred to prior to the Merger (as defined below)). On July 2, 2015, the common and preferred shareholders of Private Synlogic executed the Synlogic, LLC Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which such common and preferred shareholders contributed such shareholders’ equity interests in Private Synlogic in exchange for common and preferred units in a newly formed parent company named Synlogic, LLC (the 2015 Reorganization). In addition, IBDCo was formed as a subsidiary of Synlogic, LLC, as part of the 2015 Reorganization, and we entered into a license, option and merger agreement with AbbVie for the development of treatments for IBD. In May 2017, we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which Synlogic, LLC merged with and into Private Synlogic with Private Synlogic continuing as the surviving corporation.

On August 28, 2017, Synlogic, Inc., formerly known as Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIRN) (Mirna), completed its business combination with Synlogic, Inc. in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 15, 2017, by and among Mirna, Meerkat Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), and Private Synlogic (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Synlogic, with Private Synlogic surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mirna (the Merger). On August 25, 2017, in connection with, and prior to the completion of, the Merger, Mirna effected a 1:7 reverse stock split of its common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), and on August 28, 2017, immediately after completion of the Merger, Mirna changed its name to “Synlogic, Inc.” (NASDAQ: SYBX). 
 Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Mirna issued shares of its common stock to Private Synlogic’s stockholders, at an exchange ratio of 0.5532 shares of Mirna’s common stock, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, for each share of Private Synlogic common stock and preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (Exchange Ratio). In addition, Mirna assumed all of the stock options outstanding under the Synlogic 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (2017 Plan), with such stock options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Mirna’s common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Private Synlogic common stock previously represented by such options. Mirna also assumed the 2017 Plan.
