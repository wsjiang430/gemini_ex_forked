ITEM 1 BUSINESS
 American Vanguard Corporation (“AVD”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in January 1969 and operates as a holding company. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the “Company” or the “Registrant,” in this Annual Report refer to AVD. The Company conducts its business through its principle operating subsidiaries, including AMVAC Chemical Corporation (“AMVAC”) for its domestic business and AMVAC Netherlands BV (“AMVAC BV”) for its international business.
 The operating subsidiaries in the U.S. include: AMVAC, GemChem, Inc. (“GemChem”), Envance Technologies, LLC (“Envance”), TyraTech Inc. (“TyraTech”) and OHP Inc. (“OHP”).
Internationally, the Company operates its business through the following subsidiaries: AMVAC BV, AMVAC Hong Kong Limited (“AMVAC Hong Kong”), AMVAC Mexico Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC M”), AMVAC de Costa Rica Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (“AMVAC CR Srl”), AMVAC Singapore Pte, Ltd (“AMVAC Sgpr”), Grupo AgriCenter (including the parent AgriCenter S.A. and its subsidiaries) (“AgriCenter”), AMVAC do Brasil Representácoes Ltda (“AMVAC do Brasil”), AMVAC do Brazil 3p LTDA (“AMVAC 3p”), American Vanguard Australia PTY Ltd (“AVD Australia”), AgNova Technologies PTY Ltd (“AgNova”), and the Agrinos group (“Agrinos”).
 Based on similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company’s business is aggregated into one reportable segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7 for selective enterprise information.
 AMVAC is a California corporation that traces its history from 1945 and is a manufacturer of chemical, biological and biorational products that develops and markets solutions for agricultural, commercial and consumer uses. It synthesizes and formulates chemicals and ferments and extracts microbial products for crops, turf and ornamental plants, and human and animal health protection. These products, which include insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, soil health, plant nutrition, molluscicides, growth regulators, and soil fumigants, are marketed in liquid, powder, and granular forms. AMVAC primarily synthesizes, formulates, and distributes its own proprietary products or custom manufactures, formulates or distributes for others. In addition, the Company has carved out a leadership position in closed delivery systems, currently offers certain of its products in SmartBox, Lock ‘n Load and EZ Load systems, and its most recent commercial high technology packaging system known as SIMPAS (see “Intellectual Property” below) which permits the delivery of multiple products (from AMVAC and/or other companies) at variable rates in a single pass. AMVAC has historically expanded its business through both the acquisition of established chemistries, the development and commercialization of new formulations or compounds through licensing arrangements, the expansion of its global distribution network to gain broader market access, and self-funded research and development of precision application technology. Beginning in 2021, we have commenced basic molecular research and development of intellectual property related to our green solutions portfolio.

AMVAC BV is a Netherlands Corporation that was established in 2012 and is based in the Netherlands. AMVAC BV sells product both directly and through its network of subsidiaries in various international territories.
Below is a description of the Company’s acquisition/licensing activity over the past three years.
On July 1, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets from Syngenta Crop Protection related to the herbicide trifloxysulfuron ("Envoke"), including end-use registrations, data compensation claims, trademarks, formulation know-how, and books and records.
 On October 8, 2020, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, AVD Australia, completed the purchase of all the outstanding shares of AgNova, an Australian company that sources, develops, and distributes specialty crop protection and production solutions for agricultural and horticultural producers and for selected non-crop users. AgNova has an established reputation for cost-effective product development from original concept through evaluation, registration, marketing, and sales, with new technologies flowing from its development pipeline. AgNova is committed to the provision of innovative, value-adding solutions for agriculture and related industries. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, and existing working capital.
 On October 2, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, completed the purchase of all the outstanding shares of Agrinos from Agrinos AS, a Norwegian holding company, from a liquidation proceeding of that entity before a Norwegian bankruptcy court in Oslo, Norway. In addition to the shares of Agrinos, AMVAC acquired a bank of microbial and micronutrients, as well as about 150 pending or issued patents. Agrinos is a fully integrated biological input supplier with proprietary technology, manufacturing facilities, and global distribution capabilities. Its High Yield Technology® product platform works in conjunction with other nutritional crop inputs to increase crop yield, improve soil health and reduce the environmental footprint of traditional agricultural practices. The acquired assets included product registration, trade names and trademarks, customer lists, workforce, fixed assets, two factories and existing working capital.
 On April 1, 2020, the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, AMVAC, acquired 6,250,000 common shares of Clean Seed Capital Group Ltd. (Clean Seed), representing an ownership of approximately 8%. In addition, AMVAC licensed from Clean Seed certain intellectual property rights related to Clean Seed’s SMART planting technologies.
Seasonality
 The agricultural chemical industry, in general, is cyclical in nature. The demand for AVD’s products tends to be seasonal. Seasonal usage, however, does not necessarily follow calendar dates, but more closely follows growing patterns, weather conditions, geography, weather related pressure from pests and customer marketing programs. Further, growing seasons vary by geographical region; thus, there is no single seasonal cycle affecting our sales. Rather, multiple seasons transpire over the course of the calendar year.
Backlog
 AVD primarily sells its products based on purchase orders. The purchase orders are typically fulfilled within a short time frame. As a result, backlog is not considered a significant factor of, or a valid metric for, AVD’s business. The 2022 year, however, did end with a significantly larger than normal backlog of orders, primarily resulting from supply chain challenges on one specific product line in the last three months of 2022.
Customers
 The Company’s largest three customers accounted for 18%, 13% and 8% of the Company’s sales in 2022; 17%, 14% and 8% in 2021; and 17%, 12% and 10% in 2020.
 Distribution
 In the U.S. AMVAC predominantly distributes its products through national distribution companies and buying groups or co-operatives, which purchase AMVAC’s goods on a purchase order basis and, in turn, sell them to retailers/growers/end-users.

Internationally, AMVAC BV has sales offices or wholly owned distributors in Central America, Mexico, Brazil, Australia, and India, and sales force executives or sales agents in several other territories. The Company’s domestic and international distributors, agents and customers typically have long-established relationships with retailers/end-users, far-reaching logistics and transportation capabilities, and/or customer service expertise. The markets for AVD’s products vary by region, target crop, use and type of distribution channel. AVD’s customers are experts at addressing these various markets.
Competition
 In its many marketplaces, AVD faces competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than AVD. AVD’s capacity to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications (including delivery systems and precision application technologies) for its current products and/or expand its product lines and customer base. AVD competes principally based on quality, product efficacy, price, technical service and customer support. In some cases, AVD has positioned itself in smaller niche markets, which are no longer addressed by larger companies. In other cases, for example in the Midwest corn and soybean markets, the Company competes directly against larger competitors.
Manufacturing
 Through its six manufacturing facilities (see Item 2, Properties), AVD synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end-use products. Further, the Company formulates and packages its end-use products at four of its own facilities or at the facilities of third-party formulators in the U.S. and at various international locations. Two of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are biological fermentation sites, one site in the U.S., and one in Mexico, and, in addition, has a product manufacturing arrangement at a third-party facility in India.
Raw Materials
 AVD utilizes numerous companies to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products. Many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources. In instances where there is a single source of supply, AVD seeks to secure its supply by either long-term (multi-year) arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers. Further, where the availability or cost of certain raw materials may be subject to the effect of tariffs and/or supply chain disruption, the Company may order goods at times or in volumes out of the ordinary course to optimize pricing and to ensure supply.
Intellectual Property
 AVD’s proprietary product formulations are protected, to the extent possible, as trade secrets and, to a lesser extent, by patents. Certain of the Company’s closed delivery systems are patented, and the Company has both pending and issued patents relating to its equipment portfolio, particularly with respect to its SIMPAS and ULTIMUS technology. In addition, the Company owns multiple issued patents relating to both its low-impact Envance solutions as well as its Agrinos biological and microbial solutions. Further, AVD’s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets. AVD considers that, in the aggregate, its product registrations, trademarks, licenses, customer lists and patents constitute valuable assets. While it does not regard its current business as being materially dependent upon any single product registration, trademark, license, or patent, it believes that patents will play an increasingly important role in its precision application technologies and green solutions portfolio.


EPA Registrations
 In the U.S., AVD’s products also receive protection afforded by the terms of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), pursuant to which it is unlawful to sell any pesticide in the U.S., unless such pesticide has first been registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“USEPA”). Most of the Company’s products that are sold in the U.S. are subject to USEPA registration and periodic re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA. This registration by USEPA is based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment, when used according to approved label directions. In addition, each state requires a specific registration before any of AVD’s products can be marketed or used in that state. State registrations are predominantly renewed annually with a smaller number of registrations that are renewed on a multiple year basis. Foreign jurisdictions typically have similar registration requirements by statute.
In addition, certain of the Company’s biological products are labeled organic under the Organic Materials Review Institute (“OMRI”), Washington State Department of Agriculture (“WSDA”) and/or California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”) and, as such, are subject to the requirements of those certification standards, including with respect to raw materials and processes. As is the case with synthetic products, these biological products are also subject to specific labeling requirements that may vary from state to state.
 The USEPA, state, and foreign agencies have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by AVD. AVD, on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing, required data relative to specific products. Under FIFRA, the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support U.S. registrations, including in the case of adding labeled uses. This requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as regulatory compliance, with USEPA and other such bodies in the markets in which the Company sells its products. In addition, at times, the Company is required to generate new formulations of existing products and/or to produce new products in order to remain compliant. The Company expensed $18,168, $16,568 and $15,613, during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on these activities.

Environmental
 During 2022, AMVAC continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility in Commerce, CA. (the “Facility”). An outline of the history of those activities follows.
 In 1995, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (“DTSC”) conducted a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) Facility Assessment (“RFA”) of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits. In March 1997, the RFA culminated in DTSC accepting the Facility into its Expedited Remedial Action Program. Under this program, the Facility was required to conduct an environmental investigation and health risk assessment. This activity then took two paths: first, the RCRA permit closure and second, the larger site characterization.
 With respect to the RCRA permit closure, in 1998, AMVAC began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the Facility (which had allowed AMVAC to store hazardous waste longer than 90 days) as required by federal regulations. Formal regulatory closure actions began in 2005 and were completed in 2008, as evidenced by DTSC’s October 1, 2008, acknowledgement of AMVAC’s Closure Certification Report.


With respect to the larger site characterization, soil and groundwater characterization activities began in December 2002 in accordance with the Site Investigation Plan that was approved by DTSC. Additional activities were conducted from 2003 to 2014, with oversight provided by DTSC. In 2014, the Company submitted a remedial action plan (“RAP”) to DTSC, under the provisions of which, the Company proposed not to disturb sub-surface contaminants, but to continue monitoring, maintain the cover above affected soil, enter into restrictive covenants regarding the potential use of the property in the future, and provide financial assurances relating to the requirements of the RAP. In January 2017, the RAP was circulated for public comment. DTSC responded to those comments and, on September 29, 2017, approved the RAP as submitted by the Company. The Company continues to conduct groundwater monitoring and maintain the cover above affected soil. In 2022, the Company recorded land use covenants on certain affected parcels and continues to work with DTSC to prepare a Remedial Action Completion Report and to obtain further clarification on financial assurance obligations relating to the RAP. At this stage, the Company does not believe that costs to be incurred in connection with the RAP will be material and has not recorded a loss contingency for these activities.
 AMVAC is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at its six manufacturing facilities. The Company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the latest environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies. The USEPA and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on the Company’s operations.
 AMVAC expends substantial effort to minimize the risk of discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment. Wherever feasible, AMVAC recovers and recycles raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs.
 The Company is committed to a long-term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment, as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns.
 Human Capital Resources
 We believe that, beyond being essential to our operations, our people have inestimable worth independent of our business. As outlined in our Human Rights Policy (see, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab), we believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons. Accordingly, we have insinuated that belief throughout the fabric of our operations in our approach toward our employees. Indeed, the first two core values underlying our commitment to sustainability (see, Update to Corporate Sustainability Report, www.american-vanguard.com under ESG tab) are “Safety First” – which is a culture that begins with highly-regulated manufacturing plants, continues into the design of science-backed products and extends into market-leading delivery systems – and “Making a Difference” – under which, by rewarding achievement and giving our employees a voice, we attract diverse employees who want to make a difference in their careers, in the company and in the communities that we serve.
Our Human Capital program consists of the following elements:
 •Board Oversight – through our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (“N&CG”), our board of directors oversees human capital-related risks and opportunities. At least annually, the N&CG Committee requires that management update succession planning for key executives, including with respect to planning for the future with a commitment toward diversity, equity and inclusion. 
 •Strategy and Development – the Company’s human capital strategy has two primary elements: giving our employees a voice and providing them with competitive benefits (including an outstanding health benefits plan and awards of common stock to the entire workforce). As we have covered in our Update to Corporate Sustainability Report, our Company is a destination for highly qualified employees who are drawn to a workplace where they can make a difference. Our managerial approach is that our functions work in a collaborative manner – cutting across departmental lines to arrive at better solutions with a high level of efficiency. This strategy has enabled the Company to maximize retention, even in an increasingly competitive employment market. 


•Compensation – as mentioned in our Strategy above, compensation is an essential element of our human capital approach. During the pandemic in the midst of the so-called “Great Resignation” that affected many industries, we took measures to incentivize our workforce to remain with us, including across-the-board wage increases in certain of our manufacturing facilities. To the extent that our highly skilled personnel are being recruited by other companies, we endeavor to keep an open conversation on their needs and, where appropriate, have increased their total compensation (through a combination of wage, stock and/or vacation) to retain them.
 •Voice – our management style is to solicit good ideas from employees, involve them in implementation and give them recognition for ideas that succeed. For example, personnel from virtually any department (be it sales, technology, product development or otherwise) can submit ideas to our Innovation Review Committee (“IRC”) for consideration and potential funding. The IRC continues to be a source of new product ideas that has enabled us to launch several new formulations and other solutions on an annual basis. Similarly, our Beekeeper platform is a company-only social media channel on which employees anywhere in the world can report on their accomplishments, commendations of others and local developments. 
 •Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) – the Company continues to expand its DEI program. And we believe that this commitment starts at the top. Three of nine members (33%) of our board of directors are female and two of nine (22%) are from underrepresented groups (LGBTQ and Latinx). Based upon the Company’s most current EEO-1 (“Equal Employment Opportunity”) Report, representation of African Americans in our domestic workforce exceeds the prevalence of that group in the national population, while representation of Hispanic personnel is slightly below the national average. 
 •ESG at American Vanguard - at the center of our Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance commitment is the principle of Sustainable Agriculture, which, we believe, is broad enough to encompass a comprehensive ESG program, but clear enough to give us direction in our outlook and purpose in our activities. 
 Sustainable Agriculture: We are committed to doing our best toward building a stable, affordable food supply both now and into the future. That commitment rests upon a foundation of social responsibility and equity. In that vein, we believe that sustainable agriculture must include these three principles:
 
Climate Equity – as outlined in our Climate Change Commitment, we are committed to making enterprise-wide, progressive and measurable efforts toward helping to arrest the trend of climate change. In making decisions, taking actions and conducting our operations we are mindful of climate equity, which holds that climate change has three primary effects – generational, regional and individual. To that end, we believe that reducing our carbon impact and, through our products and services, enabling others to do so will advance climate equity consistent with the 2-degree warmer world as per the Paris Agreement. We advance this commitment on multiple fronts. We offer over 100 eco-friendly products – such as natural oils from Envance (used in Proctor & Gamble’s Zevo product line), microbial High Yield solutions from Agrinos (that enhance soil health and promote carbon sequestration) and tailored bionutritional products from Greenplants. In addition, our patented SIMPAS® precision application system, which enables a grower to dispense multiple crop inputs at variable rates as per an agronomist’s prescription (“only what is needed, precisely where it is needed”) serves to maximize yield while minimizing the environmental footprint. Further, our Ultimus® technology enables us to measure, record and verify (“MRV”) crop input activity anywhere on the field. When linked to a permanent ledger, such as Blockchain, Ultimus can generate an immutable record of a grower’s activity and, particularly when used with our green solution products and SIMPAS, provides the ideal solution for the fast-growing carbon credit market. Through these means we are endeavoring to make the planet a better place than we found it.


Environmental Equity – we recognize that our planet has limited resources and that what we do with them has an effect on the habitat for both humans and other species, both for today and tomorrow. We also recognize that our activities can affect the environment generationally, regionally and individually. We are, therefore, committed to environmental equity in our operations. Specifically, and as more fully outlined in our sustainability reports (click on “ESG” on American-vanguard.com), we seek to conserve finite resources such as water, land and energy while protecting the environment and enhancing biodiversity, so that these resources are available in amounts and quality to support our neighbors and future generations. In addition, we have committed significant resources toward supporting growers with precision application technology – like SIMPAS and Ultimus – that enable growers to manage, optimize and trace the use of crop and soil inputs, and to use only what is needed, precisely where it is needed. And we are mindful of those who might be disproportionately affected by what we do, such as loaders and applicators of our products. To that end, we have been at the forefront of user-friendly, returnable, reusable closed delivery systems (from Lock ‘n Load to SMARTBox to SIMPAS/SmartCartridges) to minimize exposure and maximize safety for those on-the-ground.

Food Equity – Implicit in our commitment to sustainable agriculture is the principle of food equity, which has three aspects, once again, generational, regional and individual. First, food security – we believe it is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of the Ag industry. We contribute toward food security by investing in both eco-friendly solutions that promote long-term soil and precision application and MRV technology, like SIMPAS and Ultimus, that give growers the best tools possible to ensure that their operations are viable, both today and tomorrow. Second, food availability – ensuring that food gets from field-to-table. As we saw in the pandemic, the supply chain for food can be broken, and those who suffer most are often those farthest from the fields. To that end, we support field-to-table efforts and programs to reduce food waste. Third, food affordability – ensuring that food prices can be maintained for all, including the impoverished. We do this by giving farmers effective tools, including precision application equipment, that optimize their costs, boost their yield, and enable them to produce and market food at reasonable costs.

Social Responsibility – our discussion of Sustainable Agriculture would not be complete without specific mention of our commitment to social responsibility. This concept is inherent in all forms of equity, be they climate, environmental or food related. However, social responsibility gives us pause to consider factors of a more fundamental nature, such as human rights. Our Human Rights Policy details our essential belief that we respect and support human rights, both within and article of our operations. We believe that it is fundamental to our corporate responsibility and, indeed, to our humanity, that we recognize, respect and nurture the freedom and dignity of all persons.

Under the umbrella of Sustainable Agriculture, we are committed to operating our business with a sense of mindfulness – toward the climate, toward the environment and toward the good of humans and other species. We consider ourselves to be part of a broader mission – one of ensuring that people can rely upon a stable, affordable food supply both now and in the future. It is a privilege to be part of that mission. With that privilege comes responsibility, and we take that responsibility seriously.
 The Company employed 822 employees as of December 31, 2022, and 804 employees as of December 31, 2021. From time to time, due to the seasonality of its business, AVD uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees.

 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 Supply Chain/Regulatory/Geopolitical/Tax Risks
 Disruption in the global supply chain is creating delays, unavailability and adverse conditions for our industry, including significant price increases especially with regard to ocean bound shipments. Since the inception of the coronavirus pandemic, the global supply chain has been under increased stress stemming from container shortages, a lack of domestic truck drivers and a shift in consumer buying habits. While shipping channels normalized in 2022, freight costs rose to peak levels. Further, the lockdown practices arising from China’s zero-COVID policy, followed by a lifting of those practices and widespread infection have resulted in factory capacity constraints and temporary closures in that country. This disruption interrupted the supply of a certain key intermediate ingredient for the Company’s leading corn soil insecticide during the fourth quarter of 2022, which contributed to lower-than-expected net sales and profit margin of the Company on a consolidated basis during that reporting period. While that supplier has resumed full operations, there is no guarantee that continued supply of raw materials and intermediates will not be impacted by further developments relating to the pandemic in that region. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial condition or cash flows.
The regulatory climate remains challenging to the Company’s interests both domestically and internationally. Various agencies within the U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign governments continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses (or the expansion of such uses) of many chemistries, including several of the Company’s products and, in some cases, have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses. The challenge of the regulatory climate is more pronounced in certain geographical regions (outside the U.S.) where the Company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) employs a hazard-based analysis when considering whether product registrations can be maintained; under this approach, EU regulatory authorities typically do not weigh benefit against risk in their assessments and routinely cancel products for which a safer alternative is available, notwithstanding the benefit of the cancelled product. There is no guarantee that this regulatory climate will change in the near term or that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of such regulatory challenges.


Several of the Company’s organophosphates are subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the FFDCA which, if granted, could result in the limitation and/or cancellation of one or more registrations for such products. Presently, several of the Company’s organophosphate products are under registration review before the USEPA and, at the same time, subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FFDCA"). The Company continues to provide data and other analysis to USEPA in support of its registrations and in response to that agency’s requests for clarification. However, in the recent past, USEPA revoked tolerances for chlorpyrifos (an OP not sold by the Company) finding that food residues from that product could not be deemed with reasonable certainty to cause no harm Consequently, the agency cancelled the registrations for chlorpyrifos. There is no guarantee that USEPA will not make a similar finding with respect to one or more of the Company’s OPs, and that some or all uses of the Company’s OP products could be limited or cancelled. Accordingly, the Company intends to take all action necessary to defend its registrations. Such limitations and/or cancellations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.
 USEPA has issued a proposed final decision ("PFD") to cancel PCNB. In mid-2022, the USEPA issued a “proposed final decision” (a variety of agency action heretofore unknown to registrants) to cancel the fungicide PCNB, which is registered by the company for use on golf courses and potatoes, among other things. The basis for its PFD was the agency’s initial contention that the product is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (“PBT”). The Company disagrees with the agency’s contention and believes that its scientific support for those findings is flawed. In reaching a conclusion that a registered product is a PBT, the agency tends to focus far less on product benefit and far more on product risk. Further, by issuing a PFD, USEPA is, in effect, skipping two steps in the registration review process (namely, the preliminary interim decision and interim decision) during which the Company would otherwise have more time to answer the agency’s concerns and otherwise provide data necessary to support continued registration. In effect, then, the Company must meet a truncated schedule for defending this product, all of which is posted on a public docket, and is doing so under a more stringent standard of review (namely, that of a deemed PBT). Since making its initial determination, the agency has suggested that PCNB may merely have some characteristics of a PBT. There is no guarantee that the Company will succeed in persuading USEPA not to cancel the PCNB registration. AMVAC is the sole registrant of PCNB which it manufactures at its own facility. Loss of this product could have a material adverse negative effect on our operating results.
USEPA has issued a notice of intention to suspend DCPA, the technical ingredient of an important herbicide registered by the company for use on high-value vegetable crops. In April 2022, USEPA issued a notice of intention to suspend ("NOITS") the registration for DCPA based upon the company’s alleged failure to take appropriate steps in responding to an extensive data call in for nearly 90 data studies. The NOITS came as a surprise to AMVAC, as it had been working in good faith to provide dozens of studies over several years, some of which were so complex that it required a review process extending to five years just to define the study protocols. The NOITS is currently pending before an administrative law judge ("ALJ"), who conducted a hearing on the matter in January 2023 and is likely to issue an order within 90-120 days. There is no guarantee that the ALJ will rule in AMVAC’s favor and deny the requested suspension. If AMVAC does not succeed at the NOITS hearing, there is no guarantee that USEPA will not seek to suspend the registration of most any product for which a data call-in is pending, including one or more of AMVAC’s other products. Further, a suspension of DCPA and/or other products could have a material, adverse effect upon the Company’s business operations and financial performance.
Product liability judgments on glyphosate and cases involving other pesticides by domestic courts present a litigation risk to companies in this industry. Multiple judgments have been rendered by domestic courts in product liability cases against Bayer/Monsanto in connection with injuries allegedly arising from exposure to the herbicide product, glyphosate. The basis was purported carcinogenicity based largely upon the findings of a certain international organization, despite significant scientific evidence to the contrary. While the Company does not sell glyphosate, the theory of these results could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk. There is no guarantee that one or more product liability actions would not be brought against the Company on a similar basis, and it is possible that adverse rulings in any such actions could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.
 The trend of passing pesticide “ban-bills” in various states could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk—In certain states, including Maryland and New York, state and/or local legislatures have passed legislation banning the use of specific pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, or pesticide in general, in spite of valid registrations at USEPA and/or the equivalent state agency. While the Company does not sell chlorpyrifos products, there is no guarantee that one or more of its registered products would not be targeted in state or local legislation of this nature. Further, such legislation could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.


Use of the Company’s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups. Use of agrochemical products, including the Company’s products, is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal, state and foreign statutes, including FIFRA, the Food Quality Protection Act, Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and the Clean Water Act, to name a few. These challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the USEPA and/or other federal, state or foreign agencies, the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions, the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the Company’s interests, and/or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by regulatory agencies in the course of registration, re-registration or label expansion. The most prominent of these actions include a line of cases under which environmental groups have sought to suspend, cancel or otherwise restrict the use of pesticides that have been approved by USEPA on the ground that that agency failed to confer with the National Marine Fishery Service and/or the Fish and Wildlife Service under the ESA with respect to biological opinions relating to the use of such products. While industry has been active in defending registrations and proposing administrative and legislative approaches to address serious resource issues at the affected agencies, these cases continue to be brought. It is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed, resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of the Company’s products and consolidated financial statements.
 The distribution and sale of the Company’s products are subject to governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation. The Company’s products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling of its products. The labeling requirements restrict the use of, and type of, application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less available, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and cash flows. Substantially all the Company’s products are subject to the USEPA (and/or similar agencies in the various territories or jurisdictions in which we do business) registration and re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA or similar laws. Such registration requirements are based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions. All states, where any of the Company’s products are used, also require registration before products, such as the Company sells, can be marketed or used in that state. Governmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be fulfilled on the Company’s products. The Company, on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products. There can be no assurance, however, that the USEPA or similar agencies will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated, or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future. The Company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance.
 The manufacturing of the Company’s products is subject to governmental regulations. The Company currently owns and operates six manufacturing facilities which are located in Los Angeles, California; Axis, Alabama; Hannibal, Missouri; Marsing, Idaho; Clackamas, Oregon; and Etchojoa, Mexico (the “Facilities”). The Facilities operate under the laws and regulations imposed by relevant country, state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company’s products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company’s manufacture of one or more of its products and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to provide customers with its products in a timely and affordable manner.
 A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We operate in many different countries and in many states within the United States, and we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A material change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA") was signed into law. The IRA contains several revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum income tax for corporations with average annual adjusted financial statement income over a three-tax-year period in excess of $1 billion and is effective for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations after December 31, 2022, and business tax credits and incentives for the development of clean energy projects and the production of clean energy. At this time, we do not expect the IRA will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, any future stock repurchase of our common stock will be subject to the new excise tax law.


Pandemic/Climate/Geopolitical Risks
 The COVID-19 pandemic is creating risk, uncertainties and adverse conditions in many industries both here and abroad. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how the pandemic is impacting its customers, business partners, and employees. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company is unable to predict the impact that the pandemic will have on its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s operations and those of its customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to operate without material disruption for the duration of the pandemic or that its financial conditions and results of operations and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by the pandemic in future periods.
 Climate Change may adversely affect the Company’s business. Over the course of the past several years, global climate conditions have become increasingly inconsistent, volatile and unpredictable. Many of the regions in which the Company does business have experienced excessive moisture, cold, drought and/or heat of an unprecedented nature at various times of the year. In some cases, these conditions have either reduced or obviated the need for the Company’s products, whether pre-plant, at-plant, post-emergent or at harvest. Further, the random nature of climactic change has made it increasingly difficult to forecast market demand and, consequently, financial performance, from year-to-year. There is no guarantee that climate change will abate in the near future, and it is possible that such change will continue to hinder the Company’s ability to forecast its sales performance with accuracy and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.
The Company’s business may be adversely affected by weather effects and commodity prices. Demand for many of the Company’s products tends to vary with weather conditions and weather-related pressure from pests. Adverse weather conditions, then, may reduce the Company’s revenues and profitability. In light of the possibility of adverse seasonal effects, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain sales performance at historical levels in any particular region. Similarly, demand for the Company’s products used in row crops tends to vary with the commodity prices of those crops, for instance, corn, soybeans and cotton. These prices may be driven in part by weather, pest pressure, the domestic farm economy and international markets (e.g., yield and pricing from similar crops grown in Brazil). There is no guarantee that the farm economy and row crop commodity prices will maintain sufficient strength and stability to support the Company’s products at or above historical levels.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine may expand into a broader international conflict that could adversely affect multiple channels of commerce and markets. While business operations relating to Ukraine constitute an immaterial part of the Company’s overall business, there is no guarantee that the current conflict will not draw military intervention from other countries or retaliation from Russia, which, in turn, could lead to a much larger conflict. If such escalation should occur, supply chain, trade routes and markets currently served by the Company could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could materially, adversely affect the Company’s business operations and financial performance.
The Company may be subject to environmental liabilities. The Company is fully committed toward minimizing the risk of discharge of materials into the environment and to complying with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment, its neighbors and its workforce. Nevertheless, federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for any violation of the various laws and governmental regulations. In addition, while the Company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the latest environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials. In short, the Company may be held liable for significant damages or fines relating to any environmental contamination, injury, or compliance violation which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, statements of operations and cash flows.


Acquisition/Investment Risks
 Newly acquired businesses or product lines may not generate forecasted results. While the Company conducts due diligence using a combination of internal and third-party resources and applies what it believes to be appropriate criteria for each transaction before making acquisitions, there is no guarantee that a business or product line acquired by the Company will generate results that meet or exceed results that were forecasted by the Company when evaluating the acquisition. There are many factors that could affect the performance of a newly acquired business or product line. While the Company uses assumptions that are based upon due diligence and other market information in valuing a business or product line prior to concluding an acquisition, actual results generated post-closing could vary widely from the Company’s forecast and, as such, could have a material effect upon the Company’s overall financial performance.
 The Company’s investment in foreign businesses may pose additional risks. With the expansion of its footprint internationally, the Company now carries on business at a material level in some jurisdictions that have a history of political, economic or currency-related instability and customers with a potentially higher risk profile regarding accounts receivable collectability, as compared to the Company’s legacy business. While such instability may not be present at the current time, there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in one or more jurisdictions quickly and without notice, nor is there any guarantee that the Company would be able to recoup its investment in such territories in light of such changes and potential losses due to political factors, economic factors, devaluation of local currencies, or the collectability risk from customers. Adverse changes of this nature could have a material effect upon the Company’s overall financial performance.
 The Company’s investment in technology may not generate forecasted returns. The Company has had a history of investing in technological innovation, including with respect to precision application technologies (such as SIMPAS and Ultimus), natural oil technology and biologicals, as one of its core strategies. These investments are based upon the premise that new technology will allow for safer handling or lower overall toxicity profile of the Company’s product portfolio, appeal to regulatory agencies and the market we serve, gain commercial acceptance, and command a return that is sufficiently in excess of the investment. However, there is no guarantee that a new technology will be successfully commercialized, generate a material return or maintain market appeal. Further, many types of development costs must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. This, in turn, tends to put downward pressure on period profitability. There can be no assurance that these expenses will be recovered through successful long-term commercialization of a new technology.
 The Company’s growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions. Over the past few decades, the Company’s growth has been driven by acquisitions and licensing of both established and developmental products from third parties. There is no guarantee that acquisition targets or licensing opportunities meeting the Company’s investment criteria will remain available or will be affordable. If such opportunities do not present themselves, then the Company may be unable to duplicate historical growth rates in future years.
 The Company is dependent upon sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials and active ingredients. There are a limited number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the Company in a number of its products. Certain of these raw materials are available solely from single sources either domestically or overseas. In connection with supply chain disruptions in 2021, phosphorus and related compounds were increasingly difficult to source for our entire industry; ensuring a continuous supply required extraordinary efforts both with respect to sourcing and production planning. In the last quarter of 2022, there was a temporary supply chain shortage of one key raw material of the Company’s largest corn soil insecticide, Aztec. That said, there is no guarantee that any of our suppliers will be willing or able to supply these products to the Company reliably, continuously and at the levels anticipated by the Company or required by the market. If these sources prove to be unreliable and the Company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these products, it is possible that the Company will not achieve its projected sales which, in turn, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial statements.
The Company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures. The Company continues to face competition from competitors around the globe that may enter the market through either offers to pay data compensation, or similar means in foreign jurisdictions, and then subsequently source material from countries having lower cost structures (typically India and China). These competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and, with low costs of goods, tend to drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain market share and pricing when facing such generic competitors, or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the Company’s products in the future.


The Company’s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company’s larger competitors. A significant portion of the Company’s products are sold to national distributors in the U.S., which also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competitor product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors’ income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company’s product lines. With the recent consolidation among domestic distribution companies, these considerations have become more pronounced. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully, or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors.
 Industry consolidation may threaten the Company’s position in various markets. The global agricultural chemical industry continues to undergo significant consolidation. Many of the Company’s competitors have grown or are expected to grow through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, these competitors will tend to be in position to realize greater economies of scale, offer more diverse portfolios and thereby exert greater influence throughout the distribution channels. Consequently, the Company may find it more difficult to compete in various markets. While such merger activity may generate acquisition opportunities for the Company, there is no guarantee that the Company will benefit from such opportunities. Further, there is a risk that the Company’s future performance may be hindered by the growth of its competitors through consolidation.
 The Company is dependent on a limited number of customers, which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers. Our top three customers accounted for 39% of the Company’s sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s future prospects may depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers. The Company cannot guarantee that these key customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 General Risks
 The carrying value of certain assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets may be subject to impairment depending upon market trends and other factors—The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of certain assets, including long-lived assets, inventory, fixed assets and intangibles. Depending upon the class of assets in question, the Company takes into account various factors including, among others, sales, trends, market conditions, cash flows, profit margins and the like. Based upon this analysis, where circumstances warrant, the Company may leave such carrying values unchanged or adjust them as appropriate. There is no guarantee that these carrying values can be maintained indefinitely, and it is possible that one or more such assets could be subject to impairment which, in turn, could have an adverse impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 The Company’s computing systems are subject to cyber security risks. In the course of its operations the Company relies on its computing systems, including access to the internet, the use of third-party applications and the storage and transmission of data through such systems. While the Company has implemented security measures to protect these systems, there is no guarantee that a third-party will not penetrate these defenses through hacking, phishing or otherwise and either compromise, corrupt or shut down these systems. Further, in the event of such incursion it is possible that confidential business information and private personal data could be taken. Such an event could adversely affect both the Company’s ability to operate, its reputation with key stakeholders and its overall financial performance.


Reduced financial performance may limit the Company’s ability to borrow under its credit facility. The Company has historically grown net sales and net income through the expansion of current product lines, the acquisition of product lines from third parties and the acquisition of both domestic and international distributors with strong niche market positions. In order to finance such acquisitions, the Company has drawn upon its senior credit facility. However, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility depends, in part, upon its satisfaction of a negative covenant that sets a maximum ratio of borrowed debt to earnings (as measured over the trailing 12-month period). There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to generate earnings necessary to ensure that it has sufficient borrowing capacity to support future acquisitions or that, when necessary, the lender group will amend the senior credit facility to provide for such borrowing capacity. Further, despite the Company’s long-standing relationship with its lenders, in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets, there is no guarantee that the Company’s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the Company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the Company’s working capital needs.
 The Company is subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdiction. The Company is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In 2017, the U.S. enacted significant tax reform, and in the long-term certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely impacted.
To the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities, the Company may experience lower profitability. While the Company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of its manufacturing facilities, our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors, including fluctuating market conditions, product life cycles, weather conditions in our key markets, availability of raw materials, manufacturing equipment performance, retention of the workforce and regulatory constraints, among other things. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maximize the utilization of its manufacturing facilities. Underutilization of such manufacturing resources could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance.
The Company’s continued success depends, in part, upon a limited number of key employees. Within certain functions, the Company relies heavily on a small number of key employees to manage ongoing operations and to perform strategic planning. In some cases, there are no internal candidates who are qualified to succeed these key personnel in the short term. In the event that the Company were to lose one or more key employees, there is no guarantee that Company could replace them with people having comparable skills. Further, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 Domestic and regional inflation trends, increased interest rates and other factors could lead to the erosion of economies and adversely impact the Company. Both the US and many other countries are experiencing inflation, which, in turn, is leading to increased costs in multiple industry segments, including agriculture and related industries. The persistence of inflation has led central bankers to increase interest rates within their regions. There is no guarantee that these measures will arrest the inflationary trend. Further, these factors, taken together with reduced productivity and constraints on the labor supply could lead to recessionary periods in the regions in which the Company does business. While the Company takes measures within its control to manage the effects of inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, ultimately, they are outside of the Company’s control. Further, the persistence and/or severity of one or more of them could adversely affect the financial performance and/or operations of the Company.
