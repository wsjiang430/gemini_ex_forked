     ITEM 1  BUSINESS
 ﻿
 General
 ﻿
 We are a global leader in the development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of medical devices and cloud-based software solutions that diagnose, treat and manage respiratory disorders including sleep disordered breathing, or SDB, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, neuromuscular disease and other chronic diseases. SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea, or OSA, and other respiratory disorders that occur during sleep. Our products and solutions are designed to improve patient quality of life, reduce the impact of chronic disease and lower healthcare costs as global healthcare systems continue to drive a shift in care from hospitals to the home and lower cost settings. Our cloud-based software digital health applications, along with our devices are designed to provide connected care to improve patient outcomes and efficiencies for our customers. 
 ﻿
 Following our formation in 1989, we commercialized a treatment for OSA. This treatment, nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP, was the first successful noninvasive treatment for OSA. CPAP systems deliver pressurized air, typically through a nasal mask, to prevent collapse of the upper airway during sleep.
 ﻿
 Since the development of CPAP, we have expanded our business by developing or acquiring a number of innovative products and solutions for a broader range of respiratory disorders including technologies to be applied in medical and consumer products, ventilation devices, diagnostic products, mask systems for use in the hospital and home, headgear and other accessories, dental devices, portable oxygen concentrators, or POCs, and cloud-based software informatics solutions to manage patient outcomes and customer and provider business processes.  Our growth has been fueled by geographic expansion, our research and product development efforts, acquisitions and an increasing awareness of SDB and respiratory conditions like COPD as significant health concerns. We are also a leading provider of cloud-based software health applications and devices designed to provide connected care, improving patient outcomes and efficiencies for healthcare providers. These tools are designed to allow fewer people to manage more patients, and empower patients to track their own health outcomes.
 ﻿
 We employ approximately 7,200 people and sell our products in approximately 120 countries through a combination of wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors.
 ﻿
 Our web site address is www.resmed.com.  Information contained on our website is not part of or incorporated into this report.

      RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
     ﻿
 Corporate History
 ﻿
 ResMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in March 1994 as the ultimate holding company for our operating subsidiaries. In June 1995, we completed an initial public offering of common stock and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market. In September 1999, we transferred our principal listing to the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, trading under the ticker symbol “RMD”. In November 1999, we established a secondary listing of our common stock via Chess Depositary Instruments, or CDIs, on the Australian Stock Exchange (now known as the Australian Securities Exchange), or ASX, also under the symbol “RMD”. Ten CDIs on the ASX represent one share of our common stock on the NYSE. 
 ﻿
 Our Australian subsidiary, ResMed Holdings Limited, was originally organized in 1989 by Dr. Peter Farrell to acquire from Baxter Center for Medical Research Pty Limited, or Baxter, the rights to certain technology relating to CPAP treatment as well as Baxter’s existing CPAP device business. Baxter acquired the rights to the technology in 1987, and sold CPAP devices in Australia from 1988 until our acquisition of the business.
 ﻿
 Since formation we have acquired a number of businesses, including distributors, suppliers, developers of medical equipment and related technologies and software solutions providers.
 ﻿
 Segment Information 
 ﻿
 Prior to the three months ended December 31, 2018, we had previously determined that our software-as-a-solutions, or SaaS, line of business was not material to our global operations in terms of revenue and profit, and therefore had not been separately reported as a segment. However, following recent acquisitions, we have quantitatively and qualitatively reassessed our segment reporting and determined the SaaS segment is material to the group, and now have two operating segments, which are the Sleep and Respiratory Care segment and the SaaS segment. See Note 15 – Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information regarding segment reporting.  Financial information about our revenues from and assets located in foreign countries is also included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
 ﻿
 The Market
 ﻿
 We are focused on the sleep and related respiratory care markets, both of which we believe are globally underpenetrated markets, and where we believe our products can improve patient outcomes, create efficiencies for our customers, help physicians and providers better manage chronic disease and reduce overall healthcare system costs. Additionally, our software solutions are focused out-of-hospital care market, which we believe is fragmented and underserved and where we see significant opportunity to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across out-of-hospital care settings.
 ﻿
 Sleep
 ﻿
 Sleep is a complex neurological process that includes two distinct states: rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep and non-rapid eye movement, or non-REM, sleep. REM sleep, which is about 20-25% of total sleep experienced by adults, is characterized by a high level of brain activity, bursts of rapid eye movement, increased heart and respiration rates, and paralysis of many muscles. Non-REM sleep is subdivided into four stages that generally parallel sleep depth; stage 1 is the lightest and stage 4 is the deepest.
 ﻿
 The upper airway has no rigid support and is held open by active contraction of upper airway muscles. Normally, during REM sleep and deeper levels of non-REM sleep, upper airway muscles relax and the airway narrows. Individuals with narrow upper airways or poor muscle tone are prone to temporary collapses of the upper airway during sleep, called apneas, and to near closures of the upper airway called hypopneas. These breathing events result in a lowering of blood oxygen concentration, causing the central nervous system to react to the lack of oxygen or increased carbon dioxide and signaling the body to respond. Typically, the individual subconsciously arouses from sleep, causing the throat muscles to contract, opening the airway. After a few gasping breaths, blood oxygen levels increase and the individual can resume a deeper sleep until the cycle repeats itself. Sufferers of OSA typically experience ten or more such cycles per hour. While these awakenings greatly impair the quality of sleep, the individual is not normally aware of these disruptions. In addition, OSA has been recognized as a cause of hypertension and a significant co-morbidity for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.

      RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
     A long-term epidemiology study published in 2013 estimated that 26% of adults age 30-70 have some form of obstructive sleep apnea. In the United States alone, this represents approximately 46 million people. Another study published in 2019 estimated that mild to severe sleep apnea impacts more than 936 million people worldwide, of which, it was estimated that more than 424 million would have moderate to severe sleep apnea.  Despite the high prevalence of OSA, there is a general lack of awareness of OSA among both the medical community and the general public. It is estimated that less than 20% of those with OSA have been diagnosed or treated. Many healthcare professionals are often unable to diagnose OSA because they are unaware that such non-specific symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, hypertension and irritability are characteristic of OSA.
 ﻿
 While OSA has been diagnosed in a broad cross-section of the population, until recently, it has typically been diagnosed among middle-aged men who are obese. However, we believe the importance of OSA in women is increasingly being recognized, with nearly 40% of new PAP patients being female. A strong association has been discovered between OSA and a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Studies have shown that SDB is present in approximately 83% of patients with drug-resistant hypertension, approximately 72% of patients with type 2 diabetes, approximately 77% of patients with obesity and approximately 76% of patients with chronic heart failure. 
 ﻿
 Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea
 ﻿
 Sleep-disordered breathing encompasses all disease processes that cause abnormal breathing patterns during sleep. Manifestations include OSA, central sleep apnea, or CSA, and hypoventilation syndromes that occur during sleep. Hypoventilation syndromes are generally associated with obesity, chronic obstructive lung disease and neuromuscular disease. OSA is the most common form of SDB.
 ﻿
 Sleep fragmentation and the loss of the deeper levels of sleep caused by OSA can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, reduced cognitive function, including memory loss and lack of concentration, depression and irritability. OSA sufferers also experience an increase in heart rate and an elevation of blood pressure during the cycle of apneas. Several studies indicate that the oxygen desaturation, increased heart rate and elevated blood pressure caused by OSA may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to angina, stroke and heart attack. Patients with OSA have been shown to have impaired daytime performance in a variety of cognitive functions including problem solving, response speed and visual motor coordination, and studies have linked OSA to increased occurrences of traffic and workplace accidents.
 ﻿
 Generally, an individual seeking treatment for the symptoms of OSA is referred by a general practitioner to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The diagnosis of OSA typically requires monitoring the patient during sleep at either a sleep clinic or the patient’s home. During overnight testing, respiratory parameters and sleep patterns may be monitored, along with other vital signs such as heart rate and blood oxygen levels. Simpler tests, using devices such as our Apnealink Air, or our automatic positive airway pressure devices, monitor airflow during sleep, and use computer programs to analyze airflow patterns. These tests allow sleep clinicians to detect any sleep disturbances such as apneas, hypopneas or subconscious awakenings. 
 ﻿
 Before 1981, the primary treatment for OSA was a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure to create a hole in the patient’s windpipe. Alternative surgical treatments have involved either uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, in which surgery is performed on the upper airway to remove excess tissue and to streamline the shape of the airway or implanting a device to add support to the soft palate. UPPP alone has a poor success rate; however, when performed in conjunction with multi-stage upper airway surgical procedures, a greater success rate has been claimed. These combined procedures, performed by highly specialized surgeons, are expensive and involve prolonged and often painful recovery periods.  Surgical treatments are not considered first line therapy for OSA.  Other alternative treatments available today include nasal surgery, mandibular advancement surgery, dental appliances, palatal implants, somnoplasty, nasal devices and electrical stimulation of the nerves or muscles.  Alternative pharmaceutical therapy treatments are reported to be under development.
 ﻿
 A variety of devices are marketed for the treatment of OSA. Most are only partially effective, but CPAP is a reliable treatment for all severities of OSA and is considered first-line therapy. Use of mandibular advancement devices is increasing as a second-line option in patients unable to use CPAP or those with mild OSA. These devices cause the mandible and tongue to be pulled forward and improve the dimensions of the upper airway.  CPAP is a non-invasive means of treating OSA. CPAP was first used as a treatment for OSA in 1980 by Dr. Colin Sullivan, the past Chairman of our Medical Advisory Board and was commercialized for treatment of OSA in the United States in the mid-1980s.  During CPAP treatment, a patient sleeps with a nasal interface connected to a small portable air device that delivers room air at a positive pressure. The patient breathes in air from the device and breathes out through an exhaust port in the interface. Continuous air pressure applied in this manner acts as a pneumatic splint to keep the upper airway open and unobstructed. Interfaces include nasal masks and nasal pillows. Sometimes, when a patient leaks air through their mouth, a full-face mask may need to be used, rather than a nasal interface.

     CPAP is not a cure and, therefore, must be used on a nightly basis as long as treatment is required. Patient compliance has been a major factor in the efficacy of CPAP treatment. Early generations of CPAP units provided limited patient comfort and convenience. Patients experienced soreness from the repeated use of nasal masks and had difficulty falling asleep with the CPAP device operating at the prescribed pressure. In more recent years, product innovations to improve patient comfort and compliance have been developed. These include more comfortable patient interface systems; delay timers that gradually raise air pressure allowing the patient to fall asleep more easily; bilevel air devices, including Variable Positive Airway Pressure, or VPAP systems, which provide different air pressures for inhalation and exhalation; heated humidification systems to make the airflow more comfortable; and autotitration devices that reduce the average pressure delivered during the night.
 ﻿
 Respiratory Care
 ﻿
 Our aim is to provide respiratory care solutions to patients with COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases, such as overlap syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, or OHS, and neuromuscular disease, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.  We aim to improve their quality of life, slow down disease progression and reduce the costs of patient management.
 ﻿
 Our products cover patients ranging from those who only require therapy from CPAP or VPAP systems at night, to those who are dependent on non-invasive or invasive ventilation for life-support and those who require portable oxygen concentrators, or POCs.  Our devices are predominantly used in the home and, to a lesser extent, in general hospital wards and respiratory wards. We supply CPAP and VPAP systems, non-invasive and invasive ventilators, humidifiers and accessories, including masks and tubing.  We also offer stationary and portable battery powered oxygen concentrators for the administration of long-term oxygen therapy in the home as well as data management systems designed to improve the management of patients.
 ﻿

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. COPD encompasses a group of lung diseases defined by persistent airflow limitation, prolongation of exhalation and loss of elasticity in the lungs.  It is a progressive and debilitating disease and is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the airways.  Symptoms encountered with COPD include shortness of breath as well as chronic cough and increased sputum production. COPD includes diseases such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.  A recent study based on recent epidemiology data estimates that there are approximately 380 million people worldwide who suffer from COPD.
 ﻿
 Patients with COPD can have different clinical presentations.  Patients with chronic bronchitis present with low level of oxygen (hypoxemia) and elevated levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia), a chronic productive cough, cor pulmonale and are commonly overweight. Patients with emphysema have more normal blood gases, are usually thin and hyperinflated and have a decreased diffusion capacity.  During sleep, chronic bronchitic patients display more severe hypoxemia.  In general, the more hypoxic a COPD patient is during the day the more severe the hypoxemia experienced during sleep.  Hypercapnia as a consequence of hypoventilation also occurs in COPD patients and is more pronounced in REM sleep.  Some COPD patients may also suffer from co-morbid OSA, a condition known as Overlap Syndrome.
 ﻿
 Home non-invasive ventilation has the potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with the management of patients with severe COPD by significantly increasing the time between hospital readmissions.
 ﻿

Overlap Syndrome. In patients with Overlap Syndrome, CPAP has been shown to provide benefits in relation to reducing mortality, decreasing hospitalizations and improving lung function and gas exchange.  Non-invasive ventilation, or NIV, has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD through its ability to improve respiratory acidosis and decrease dyspnea and work of breathing.  It may also increase survival rates and reduce length of hospital stays, as well as reducing complicating factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.  In patients with stable COPD the advantages of home NIV are less clear but clinical studies have shown improvements in dyspnea scores and health-related quality of life measures and reductions in hospital readmissions and intensive care stays.
 ﻿
 Long-term oxygen therapy, or LTOT, is indicated in chronic respiratory failure patients.  The administration of LTOT has been shown to increase survival rates in patients with severe resting hypoxemia.  In hypoxemic COPD patients, LTOT is associated with a lower mortality compared to nocturnal oxygen therapy alone and also associated with improved health-related quality of life measures.  In long-term COPD survivors with a history of congestive heart failure, LTOT is associated with a slowing of respiratory failure progression.
 ﻿
 Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. OHS is characterized by the combination of obesity, chronic alveolar hypoventilation leading to daytime hypercapnia and hypoxia and SDB after the exclusion of other causes of alveolar hypoventilation. OHS is frequently associated with OSA with an estimated 90% of patients also having OSA.

     In patients with OHS, positive airway therapy, both CPAP and NIV, has been shown to effectively treat upper airway obstruction and reverse daytime respiratory failure as well as reduce the work of breathing and improve respiratory drive. 
 ﻿

Neuromuscular Disease. Neuromuscular disease is a broad term that encompasses many diseases that either directly (via intrinsic muscle pathology) or indirectly (via nerve pathology) impair the functioning of muscles. Symptoms of neuromuscular disease and respiratory failure include increasing generalized weakness and fatigue, dysphagia, dyspnoea on exertion and at rest, sleepiness, morning headache, difficulties with concentration and mood changes. Most neuromuscular diseases are characterized by progressive muscular impairment leading to loss of ambulation, being wheelchair-bound, swallowing difficulties, respiratory muscle weakness and, eventually, death from respiratory failure. Neuromuscular disorders can progress rapidly or slowly.  Rapidly progressive conditions, such as ALS and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in teenagers, are characterized by muscle impairment which worsens over months and can result in death within a few years.  Variable or slowly progressive conditions, such as Myotonic muscular dystrophy, are characterized by muscle impairment that worsens over years and may mildly reduce life expectancy. 
 ﻿
 NIV treatment to patients with neuromuscular disease may lead to improvements in respiratory failure symptoms and daytime arterial blood gases.  In ALS patients, NIV treatment has been associated with an improvement in quality of life measures, sleep-related symptoms and survival.  Studies have demonstrated that patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may improve in quality of life measures and may increase chance of survival with NIV treatment.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe that the SDB and respiratory care markets will continue to grow in the future due to a number of factors, including increasing awareness of OSA, CSA and COPD, improved understanding of the role of SDB treatment in the management of cardiac, neurologic, metabolic and related disorders, improved understanding of the role of non-invasive ventilation in the management of COPD, and an increase in the use of digital and product technology to improve patient outcomes and create efficiencies for customers and providers. Our strategy for expanding our business operations and capitalizing on the growth of the SDB and respiratory care markets, as well as growth in out-of-hospital care settings, consists of the following key elements:
· | Continue Product Development and Innovation in SDB Products. We are committed to ongoing innovation in developing products for the diagnosis and treatment of SDB. We have been a leading innovator of products designed to treat SDB more effectively, increase patient comfort and encourage compliance with prescribed therapy. In 2016, we introduced a number of new software solutions including our ResMed Resupply, GoScripts and new features and enhancements within our cloud-based software offerings. Through our acquisition of Brightree, we also acquired a suite of software-as-a-service solutions for U.S. based distributor and home health and hospice customers. In addition, through our acquisitions of Inova Labs and Curative Medical we acquired the Inova Labs range of POCs and a portfolio of Curative Medical SDB and ventilation products. We believe that the combination of continued product development, product and technology acquisitions and innovation are key factors to our ongoing success. In 2017, we introduced a number of new products and solutions, including AirFit N20 nasal and F20 full face masks with an InfinitySeal silicone cushion, AirMini, the world’s smallest CPAP, AirTouch F20 full face mask with Ultrasoft memory foam and new integrations and enhancements of AirView and Brightree software, including AirView Action Groups. In 2018, we introduced automatic resupply enrollment for patients managed by both Brightree and ResMed, our first ResMed-branded portable oxygen concentrator called Mobi and a diffuser vent elbow for our latest CPAP full face masks called QuietAir. In 2019, we released new products including AirFit F30, a full face mask with minimal-contact cushion, and AirFit N30i and P30i, a top-of-head connected nasal and pillow mask, respectively. Approximately 17% of our employees are devoted to research and development activities.

· | Continue Product Development and Innovation in Respiratory Care Products. We are committed to ongoing innovation of our respiratory care products that serve the needs of patients with COPD and neuromuscular diseases. With the addition of Inova Labs POCs and our non-invasive ventilator devices as well as masks and accessories, we intend to continue to expand and enhance our product offerings in this area. In 2018, we launched Mobi which is our first ResMed-branded portable oxygen concentrator. In 2019, we acquired Propeller Health and its digital health platform for inhalers, rounding out our portfolio to treat COPD patients through all stages of their disease. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand SaaS solutions in Out-of-Hospital Care Settings: Our vision is to transform and significantly improve out-of-hospital healthcare through a strategy of enabling better patient care, improving clinical decision support, and driving interoperability across out-of-hospital healthcare settings. We offer software solutions across multiple out-of-hospital healthcare settings from home medical equipment, to home health and hospice, skilled nursing, private duty, and beyond. We are connecting capabilities across the platforms in these out-of-hospital care settings to help our customers be more efficient, better serve people, keep them out-of-hospital, and in lower-cost, higher-quality care settings.

· | Expand Geographic Presence. We market our products in more than 120 countries to sleep clinics, home healthcare dealers, patients and third-party payors. We intend to increase our sales and marketing efforts in our principal markets, as well as expand the depth of our presence in other high-growth geographic regions. In 2016, we acquired Curative Medical to invest in the China market and expand our growth potential in SDB, COPD and respiratory care in China. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase Public and Clinical Awareness. We continue to expand our existing promotional activities to increase awareness of SDB, COPD and other clinical conditions that can be treated with our industry-leading solutions. These promotional activities target both the population predisposed to SDB and medical specialists, such as pulmonologists, sleep medicine specialists, primary care physicians, cardiologists, neurologists and other medical subspecialists who treat these conditions and their associated co-morbidities. In the last year we invested in SleepScore Labs, a joint venture between ResMed, Dr. Mehmet Oz and Pegasus Capital to help consumers better understand and improve their sleep. We also target special interest groups, including the National Stroke Association, the American Heart Association, COPD Foundation and the National Sleep Foundation, to further increase awareness of the relationship between SDB or OSA, COPD, neuromuscular disease and co-morbidities such as cardiac disease, diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The programs also support our efforts to inform the community of the dangers of sleep apnea with regard to occupational health and safety, especially in the transport industry. We have helped establish a center for clinical care and medical research at the University of California at San Diego in the fields of sleep apnea and COPD.

· | Expand into New Clinical Applications. We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. Studies have established a clinical association between OSA and both stroke and congestive heart failure, and have recognized SDB as a cause of hypertension or high blood pressure. Research also indicates that SDB is independently associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Additionally, research supported by ResMed has demonstrated that the addition of non-invasive ventilation to patients with severe COPD who are receiving oxygen therapy, provides meaningful clinical benefits to the patient, and the broader healthcare system. We maintain close working relationships with a number of prominent physicians to explore new medical applications for our products and technology. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage the Experience of our Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the medical device industry in general, and in the fields of SDB, respiratory care and healthcare informatics in particular. We intend to continue to leverage the experience and expertise of these individuals to maintain our innovative approach to the development of products and solutions, and to increase awareness of the serious medical problems caused by SDB and the use of oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and in-home life support ventilation to treat COPD.

 Product Development and Clinical Trials 
 ﻿
 We have a strong track record of innovation in the sleep and respiratory care markets. In 1989, we introduced our first CPAP device. Since then we have been committed to an ongoing program of product advancement and development. Currently, our product development and clinical trial efforts are focused on not only improving our current product offerings and usability, but also expanding into new product applications. 
     We continually seek to identify new applications of our technology for significant unmet medical needs. SDB is associated with a number of symptoms beyond excessive daytime sleepiness and irritability. Studies have established a clinical association between untreated SDB and systemic hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and mortality.

     Across the sleep and respiratory care platforms, we support clinical trials in many countries including the United States, Germany, Netherlands, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, China, Spain, Canada, Singapore and Australia to develop new clinical applications for our technology. We have also begun presenting and publishing research findings based on the industry-leading connectivity platform and data assets that are unique to us. We continue to support some of the largest SDB studies in history by performing advanced statistical analyses on millions of clinical data points using real-world data.
 ﻿
 We consult with physicians at major medical centers throughout the world to identify clinical and technological trends in the treatment of SDB, COPD and the other conditions associated with these diseases. New product ideas are also identified by our marketing staff, direct sales force and network of distributors, customers, clinicians and patients.    ﻿
 Sales and Marketing 
 ﻿
 We currently market our products in more than 120 countries through a network of distributors and our direct sales force. We attempt to tailor our marketing approach to each national market, based on regional awareness of SDB as a health problem, physician referral patterns, consumer preferences and local reimbursement policies.  See Note 15 – Segment Information of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for financial information about our geographic areas.
 ﻿
 United States, Canada and Latin America.    Our products are typically purchased by a home healthcare dealer who then sells the products to the patient. The decision to purchase our products, as opposed to those of our competitors, is made or influenced by one or more of the following individuals or organizations: the prescribing physician and his or her staff; the home healthcare dealer; the insurer and the patient. In the United States, Canada and Latin America, our sales and marketing activities are conducted through a field sales organization made up of regional territory representatives, program development specialists and regional sales directors. Our field sales organization markets and sells products to home healthcare dealer branch locations throughout the United States, Canada and Latin America. 
 ﻿
 We also market our products directly to physicians and sleep clinics. Patients who are diagnosed with OSA or another respiratory condition and prescribed our products are typically referred by the diagnosing physician or sleep clinic to a home healthcare dealer to fill the prescription. The home healthcare dealer, in consultation with the referring physician, will assist the patient in selecting the equipment, fit the patient with the appropriate mask and set the device pressure to the prescribed level. 
 ﻿
 Our SaaS solutions are sold to providers of healthcare in various out-of-hospital settings. We market and sell our Brightree business management software and service solutions to out-of-hospital providers in the U.S and our primary markets are home medical equipment, pharmacy, home infusion, orthotics and prosthetics.  Our sales activities for Brightree products are conducted through a sales organization made up strategic account managers, sales engineers and sales directors. We develop, market and sell our MatrixCare care management and related ancillary solutions to U.S.-based out-of-hospital providers and our primary markets are senior living, skilled nursing; life plan communities; home health, home care, and hospice agencies as well as related accountable care organizations. Our MatrixCare management solutions are primarily sold through direct sales and ancillary solutions are sold both through direct sales and channel partners.

     Manufacturing 
 ﻿
 We operate a globally distributed manufacturing network designed for supply chain resilience, and that is intended to control costs and minimize risks. Our manufacturing operations consist of specialist component production as well as assembly and testing of our devices, masks and accessories. Of the numerous raw materials, parts and components purchased for assembly of our therapeutic and diagnostic sleep disorder products, many are off-the-shelf items available from multiple vendors. We also purchase uniquely configured components from various suppliers, including some who are single-source suppliers for us.  Any reduction or halt in supply from one of these single-source suppliers could limit our ability to manufacture our products or devices until a replacement supplier is found and qualified. We generally manufacture to our internal sales forecasts and fill orders as received. We strive for continuous improvement in manufacturing processes to deliver year-on-year improvement in output, cost and product quality. Each manufacturing site and team are responsible for the quality of their product group and decisions are based on performance and quality measures, including customer feedback.    ﻿
 Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 13485, FDA Quality System Regulations for Medical Devices, the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell. Our main manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and audited at regular intervals by a Notified Body. Additionally, our Sydney, Loyang, San Diego, Atlanta and Moreno Valley sites are certified under the Medical Device Single Audit Program or MDSAP, an audit of medical device manufacturers’ quality management system to satisfy multiple regulatory requirements. MDSAP audits are conducted by a MDSAP recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of multiple regulatory jurisdictions (i.e. Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United States of America).
 ﻿
 Our main manufacturing facilities are located in Sydney, Australia; Loyang, Singapore; Chatsworth, California; Johor Bahru, Malaysia; Atlanta, Georgia and Suzhou, China. Refer to Item 2 for additional details on these properties. 
 ﻿
 Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 ﻿
 The cost of medical care in many of the countries in which we operate is funded in substantial part by government and private insurance programs. In Germany, we receive payments directly from these payors. Outside Germany, although we do not generally receive payments for our products directly from these payors, our success in major markets depends on the ability of patients to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for our products. 
 ﻿
 In the United States, our products are purchased primarily by home healthcare dealers, hospitals or sleep clinics, who invoice third-party payors directly for reimbursement. Domestic third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. These payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that a device is not used in accordance with certain covered treatment methods, or is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. The long-term trend towards cost-containment, through managed healthcare, or other legislative proposals to reform healthcare, could control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and could result in lower prices for our products.  In some foreign markets, such as France, Germany and Japan, government reimbursement is currently available for purchase or rental of our products, subject to constraints such as price controls or unit sales limitations.  In Australia, China, and in some other foreign markets, there is currently limited or no reimbursement for devices that treat OSA.
 ﻿
 Healthcare reform in the United States continues to bring significant changes to the third-party payor landscape. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, implemented the competitive bidding program, which included home medical equipment, or HME, that we manufacture and develop, specifically, oxygen CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories. CMS is required by law to recompete these contracts at least once every three years. In addition, the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, required CMS to roll out the competitive bidding process nationally or adjust prices in non-competitive bidding areas, also known as the non-bid or Round 3 areas, to match competitive bidding prices by 2016.  CMS phased in the new rates beginning January 1, 2016, and the rates became fully effective July 1, 2016. The implementation of the competitive acquisition program has resulted in reduced Medicare payment for oxygen CPAP and respiratory assist devices, and related supplies and accessories in both competitive bidding areas and non-competitive bidding areas. Through an Interim Final Rule issued in May 2018, CMS increased the fee schedule amounts for certain DME in non-bid areas that qualify as rural and non-contiguous, setting payment for these areas for June 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 at a 50/50 blended reimbursement rate based on the pre-competitive bidding reimbursement rate and the adjusted reimbursement rate set through competitive bidding.

     Due to the lapse of competitive bid contracts as of December 31, 2018, effective January 1, 2019, Medicare beneficiaries may receive durable medical equipment from any Medicare-enrolled supplier until new contracts are in effect under the next round of competitive bidding, which is expected to take effect on January 1, 2021. Pricing in competitive bidding areas and non-rural, contiguous non-bid areas will continue to use adjusted fee schedule amounts, subject to annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustments, beginning in 2019, until the next bidding round takes place. CMS also extended the blended fee schedule amounts for non-bid rural and non-contiguous areas through December 31, 2020.
 ﻿
 In the next round of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) competitive bidding program, expected to take effect on January 1, 2021, there have been some revisions to the bidding methodology including the plan to implement surety bond requirements, lead item pricing, and setting reimbursement rates at the maximum winning bid rate instead of the median winning bid rate.  In addition, CMS has expanded the categories of devices subject to competitive bidding to include non-invasive ventilators, which have not previously been subject to competitive bidding.
 ﻿
 The ACA, which was passed both to expand the number of individuals with healthcare coverage and to develop additional revenue sources, also included, among other things, a deductible excise tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which medical devices are sold in the United States on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices, with limited exceptions, beginning in 2013. However, this excise tax was subsequently suspended by the U.S. Congress for medical device sales during calendar years 2016 through 2019.  If this excise tax had not been suspended it would be applicable to our products that are primarily used in hospitals and sleep labs, which includes the Apnealink Air, VPAP Tx, and certain respiratory care and dental sleep products.  Absent further Congressional action, this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2020.  The ACA also provided for a number of Medicare regulatory requirements, including new face-to-face encounter requirements for durable medical equipment and home health services.
 ﻿
 We cannot predict at this time the full impact that the ACA, or any U.S. legislation enacted in the future, will have on our revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect such challenges and amendments to continue. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the U.S. Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, will impact the ACA. Further, the administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through other judicial challenge.
 ﻿
 Service and Warranty 
 ﻿
 We generally offer either one-year or two-year limited warranties on our devices. In some regions and for certain customers we also offer extended warranties on our devices for one to three years in addition to our limited warranty. Warranties on mask systems are for 90 days. Our distributors either repair our products with parts supplied by us or arrange shipment of products to our facilities for repair or replacement. 
 ﻿
 We receive returns of our products from the field for various reasons. We believe that the level of returns experienced to date is consistent with levels typically experienced by manufacturers of similar devices. We provide for warranties and returns based on historical data. 
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The markets for our products are highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in all of our markets are product features, value-added solutions, reliability and price. Customer support, reputation and efficient distribution are also important factors.

      RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
     We compete on a market-by-market basis with various companies, some of which have greater financial, research, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Our primary competitors include Philips BV; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Limited; DeVilbiss Healthcare; Apex Medical Corporation; BMC Medical Co. Ltd.; and regional manufacturers. The disparity between our resources and those of our competitors may increase as a result of the trend towards consolidation in the healthcare industry. In addition, some of our competitors, such as Löwenstein Medical GmbH + Co. KG, are affiliates of customers of ours, which may make it difficult to compete with them. Finally, our products compete with surgical procedures, nerve stimulation devices and dental appliances designed to treat OSA and other SDB-related respiratory conditions. The development of new or innovative procedures or devices by others could result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive, which would harm our revenues and financial condition.
 ﻿
 Any product developed by us that gains regulatory clearance will have to compete for market acceptance and market share. An important factor in such competition may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing and regulatory clearance processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market are important competitive factors. In addition, our ability to compete will continue to be dependent on successfully protecting our patents and other intellectual property.    ﻿
 Patents and Proprietary Rights and Related Litigation 
 ﻿
 We rely on a combination of patents, designs, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and non-disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Some of these patents, patent applications and designs relate to significant aspects and features of our products. We believe the combination of these rights, in aggregate, are of material importance to each of our businesses. Through our various subsidiaries, as of the date of this report, we own or have licensed rights to over 5,700 pending, allowed or granted patents and designs. Patents and designs have various statutory terms based on the legislation in individual jurisdictions which may be subject to change. Of our patents, 259 U.S. patents and 705 foreign patents are due to expire in the next five years. We believe that the expiration of these patents will not have a material adverse impact on our competitive position.
 ﻿
 Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future to enforce patents issued to us, to protect our rights, or to defend third-party claims of infringement by us of the proprietary rights of others. The defense and prosecution of patent claims, including pending claims, as well as participation in other inter-party proceedings, can be expensive and time-consuming, even in those instances in which the outcome is favorable to us. Patent laws regarding the enforceability of patents vary from country to country. Therefore, there can be no assurance that patent issues will be uniformly resolved, or that local laws will provide us with consistent rights and benefits.
 ﻿
 Government Regulations 
 ﻿
 FDA
 ﻿
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation particularly as to safety, efficacy and adherence to FDA Quality System Regulation, and related manufacturing standards. Medical device products are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental agency regulations in the United States and similar regulations of foreign agencies abroad. The FDA regulates the design, development, research, preclinical and clinical testing, introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, marketing, distribution, import and export, and record keeping for such products, in order to ensure that medical products distributed in the United States are safe and effective for their intended use. In addition, the FDA is authorized to establish special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of most devices. Non-compliance with applicable requirements can result in import detentions, fines, civil and administrative penalties, injunctions, suspensions or losses of regulatory approvals, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, refusal of the government to approve product export applications or allow us to enter into supply contracts, and criminal prosecution. 
 ﻿
 Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that a manufacturer introducing a new medical device or a new indication for use of an existing medical device obtain either a Section 510(k) premarket notification clearance or a premarket approval, or PMA, before introducing it into the U.S. market. The type of marketing authorization is generally linked to the classification of the device.   The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness.
 ﻿

PART I | Item 1
-------+-------

      RESMED INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
     Our products currently marketed in the United States are marketed pursuant to 510(k) pre-marketing clearances and are either Class I or Class II devices. The process of obtaining a Section 510(k) clearance generally requires the submission of performance data and often clinical data, which in some cases can be extensive, to demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a device that was on the market before 1976 or to a device that has been found by the FDA to be “substantially equivalent” to such a pre-1976 device, a predecessor device is referred to as “predicate device.” As a result, FDA clearance requirements may extend the development process for a considerable length of time. In addition, in some cases, the FDA may require additional review by an advisory panel, which can further lengthen the process. The PMA process, which is reserved for new devices that are not substantially equivalent to any predicate device and for high-risk devices or those that are used to support or sustain human life, may take several years and requires the submission of extensive performance and clinical information. 
 ﻿
 Medical devices can be marketed only for the indications for which they are cleared or approved.  After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any change or modification that significantly affects its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, may require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and payment of an FDA user fee.  The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance; however, the FDA may review this determination to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.  The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.  The FDA recently reviewed its guidance describing when it believes a manufacturer is obligated to submit a new 510(k) for modifications or changes to a previously cleared device and determined that manufacturers should continue adhering to the 1997 guidance on this topic.  In October 2017, the FDA issued guidance that it believes preserves the basic content and format of the 1997 guidance, with updates to add clarity.    ﻿
 Any devices we manufacture and distribute pursuant to clearance or approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies.  These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions.  As a medical device manufacturer, all of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the FDA. We are required to adhere to applicable regulations setting forth detailed cGMP requirements, as set forth in the QSR, which require, manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. Noncompliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal of the government to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecutions. We believe that our design, manufacturing and quality control procedures are in compliance with the FDA’s regulatory requirements. 
 ﻿
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting, or MDR, requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. We must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
 ﻿
 Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. Medical devices approved or cleared by the FDA may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including substantial monetary penalties and criminal prosecution.
 ﻿
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country.

     EEA
 ﻿

In the European Economic Area, (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), or EEA, manufacturers of medical devices need to comply with the Essential Requirements laid out in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC). Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE Mark, manufacturers of medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a competent authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would audit and examine the Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
 ﻿
 As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. 
 ﻿
 All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EEA must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the Member States of the EEA, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.
 ﻿

Where appropriate, our products commercialized in Europe are CE marked and classified as either Class I or Class II.  
 ﻿

On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them) in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. 
 ﻿

The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication in May 2020. Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:

· | strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | establish explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These modifications may have an impact on the way we design and manufacture products and the way we conduct our business in the EEA. We are progressing in our plans to meet the new requirements.
 ﻿
 Other regulatory bodies
 ﻿
 Our devices are sold in multiple countries and often need to be registered with local regulatory bodies such as the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada in Canada and CFDA in China. 
 ﻿
 Other Healthcare Laws
 ﻿
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that may restrict our business practices, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims, physician payment transparency and data privacy and security laws.  The government has interpreted these laws broadly to apply to the marketing and sales activities of manufacturers and distributors like us.
 ﻿
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.  In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
 ﻿
 The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,463 to $22,927 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Private suits filed under the civil False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.
 ﻿
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies.
 ﻿
 The federal Physician Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, biologicals, and medical devices or supplies that require premarket approval by or notification to the FDA, and for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, other practitioners, and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Applicable manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to CMS. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,278 per failure up to an aggregate of $169,170 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.128 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
 ﻿
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to have committed a violation.

     ﻿
 Also, many U.S. states and countries outside the U.S. have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under government programs.
 ﻿
 Under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations, including the HIPAA Privacy, Security and Breach Notification Rules, to protect the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities including health care providers and their business associates. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties of up to $57,051 per violation, not to exceed $1.7 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision. In addition to federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well.
 ﻿

In some of our operations, such as those involving our cloud-based software digital health applications, we are a business associate under HIPAA and therefore required to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, Breach Notification Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so.
 ﻿
 In addition, as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the processing of personal data in the European Area, or EEA. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information (including for research purposes), increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA, including to the United States, and could be impacted by changes in law as a result of a future review of these transfer mechanisms by European regulators under the GDPR, as well as current challenges to these mechanisms in the European courts. European data protection law provides that EEA member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase, and harm our business and financial condition. The GDPR and other similar regulations impose additional conditions in order to satisfy such consent for electronic marketing, such as a prohibition on pre-checked tick boxes and bundled consents, thereby requiring customers to affirmatively consent for a given purpose through separate tick boxes or other affirmative action. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection and marketing laws of the EEA member states may result in fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties as well as individual claims for compensation. To comply with the new data protection rules imposed by GDPR we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
 ﻿
 In addition, Brexit could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes by the planned exit date of October 2019. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the European Union will be regulated, especially if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018 which will remain in force, even if and when the United Kingdom leaves the EU.
 ﻿

Numerous other state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. These laws may apply directly to our business or indirectly by contract when we provide services to other companies. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information.

     Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. 
 ﻿
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.  If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
 ﻿
 Employees 
 ﻿
 As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 7,240 employees or full-time consultants, of which approximately 2,930 were employed in cost of sales activities including areas such as warehousing and manufacturing, 1,200 in research and development and 3,110 in sales, marketing and administration. Of our employees and consultants, approximately 2,810 were located in the United States, Canada and Latin America, 1,430 in Australia, 1,250 in Europe and 1,750 in Asia. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.
