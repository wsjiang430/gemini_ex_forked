ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (the Company, Holdings, we, us, and our) is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. The Company's primary asset is sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian). Hawaiian was originally incorporated in January 1929 under the laws of the Territory of Hawai'i and became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary pursuant to a corporate restructuring that was consummated in August 2002. Hawaiian became a Delaware corporation and the Company's direct wholly-owned subsidiary concurrent with its reorganization and reacquisition by the Company in June 2005.
Our Business
We are engaged in the scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo amongst the Hawaiian Islands (the Neighbor Island routes) and between the Hawaiian Islands and certain cities in the United States (the North America routes together with the Neighbor Island routes, the Domestic routes), and between the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (the International routes), collectively referred to as our Scheduled Operations. We offer non-stop service to Hawai'i from more U.S. gateway cities (13) than any other airline, and also provide approximately 180 daily flights between the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, we operate various charter flights.
We are the longest serving airline, as well as the largest airline headquartered, in the State of Hawai'i, and the 10th largest domestic airline in the United States based on revenue passenger miles (RPMs) reported by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration Bureau of Transportation Services as of September 2018, the latest data available.
At December 31, 2018, our fleet consisted of 20 Boeing 717-200 aircraft for the Neighbor Island routes, four Boeing 767-300 aircraft, 24 Airbus A330-200 aircraft, and eleven Airbus A321-200 for the North America, International, and charter routes. We also own four ATR42 aircraft for the "Ohana by Hawaiian" Neighbor Island service and three ATR71 aircraft for our Neighbor Island cargo operations. During the first quarter of 2019, we expect to retire all four of our remaining Boeing 767-300 aircraft, completing the transition to our A321 aircraft, allowing for optimization of our products and increased management of capacity. 
Our goal is to be the number one destination carrier serving Hawai'i. We are devoted to the travel needs of the residents of and visitors to Hawai'i and we offer a unique travel experience. We are strongly rooted in the culture and people of Hawai'i and we seek to provide quality service to our customers that exemplifies the spirit of Aloha.
Outlook
Our mission is to continue to grow a profitable airline with a passion for excellence, our customers, our people and the spirit of Hawai'i. In 2019, we will continue to focus on strengthening our competitive position in the markets that we serve primarily by continuing to mature the routes we launched over the past decade, improving our long term competitive cost structure, improving the guest experience by making travel effortless and furthering our segmentation efforts through our offering of additional value-added products and services, including the introduction of our Main Cabin Basic product in 2019.
Flight Operations
Our flight operations are based in Honolulu, Hawai'i. At December 31, 2018, we operated 246 scheduled flights with:

• | Daily service on our North America routes between the State of Hawai'i and Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and New York City, New York.


• | Daily service on our Neighbor Island routes among the six major islands of the State of Hawai'i.


• | Daily service on our International routes between the State of Hawai'i and Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo (Haneda and Narita); and Osaka, Japan; and scheduled service between the State of Hawai'i and Pago Pago, American Samoa; Papeete, Tahiti; Brisbane, Australia; Auckland, New Zealand; Sapporo, Japan; and Seoul, South Korea.


• | Various ad hoc charters.

Fuel
Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs:
Year | Gallonsconsumed | Total cost,including taxes | | Average costper gallon | Percent ofoperating expenses
 | (in thousands) | | | 
2018 | 273,783 | | $ | 599,544 | | $ | 2.19 | 23.8 | %
2017 | 259,915 | | $ | 440,383 | | $ | 1.69 | 19.9 | %
2016 | 244,118 | | $ | 344,322 | | $ | 1.41 | 16.9 | %

As illustrated by the table above, fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our operating expenses. We purchase aircraft fuel at prevailing market prices, and seek to manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices by entering into various derivative financial instruments.
Aircraft Maintenance
Our aircraft maintenance programs consist of a series of phased or continuous checks for each aircraft type. These checks are performed at specified intervals measured by calendar months, time flown, and by the number of takeoffs and landings, or cycles operated. In addition, we perform inspections, repairs, and modifications of our aircraft in response to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directives. We perform checks ranging from "walk around" inspections before each flight's departure to major overhauls of the airframes which can take several weeks to complete. Aircraft engines are subject to phased maintenance programs designed to detect and remedy potential problems before they occur. The service lives of certain airframe and engine parts and components, which are time or cycle controlled, are replaced or refurbished prior to the expiration of their time or cycle limits. We have contracts with third parties to provide certain maintenance on our aircraft and aircraft engines.
Marketing and Ticket Distribution
We utilize various distribution channels including our website www.hawaiianairlines.com, primarily for our North America and Neighbor Island routes, and travel agencies and wholesale distributors for our International routes.
Our website is available in English, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese and offers our customers information on our flight schedules, information on our HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program, the ability to book reservations on our flights or connecting flights with any of our code-share partners, the status of our flights as well as the ability to purchase hotels, cars and vacation packages. We also distribute our fares through online travel agencies. 
Frequent Flyer Program
The HawaiianMiles frequent flyer program was initiated in 1983 to encourage and develop customer loyalty. HawaiianMiles allows passengers to earn mileage credits by flying with us and our partner carriers. In addition, members earn mileage credits for patronage with our other program partners, including credit card issuers, hotels, car rental firms, and general merchants pursuant to our exchange partnership agreements. We also sell mileage credits to other companies participating in the program.
HawaiianMiles members have a choice of various awards based on accumulated mileage credits, with most of the awards being redeemed for free air travel on Hawaiian.
HawaiianMiles accounts with no activity (frequent flyer miles earned or redeemed) for 18 months automatically expire. The number of free travel awards used for travel on Hawaiian was approximately 685,000 in 2018. The number of free travel awards as a percentage of total revenue passengers was approximately 6% in 2018. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal due to our ability to manage frequent flyer seat inventory, and the relatively low ratio of free award usage to total revenue passengers.
Code-Share and Other Alliances
Together with Japan Airlines, we filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) seeking antitrust immunity to create a joint venture that promises significant consumer benefits and the opportunity for service expansion. We further enhanced our comprehensive partnership with Japan Airlines with the announcement of reciprocal frequent flyer benefits for HawaiianMiles and JAL Mileage Bank members in October 2018. The initial partnership launched in March 2018 with codeshare flights between Japan and Hawaii. We have not yet received approval and we do not anticipate operations commencing under the joint venture until late 2019.

We also have marketing alliances with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage accrual and redemption privileges and code-shares on certain flights (one carrier placing its name and flight numbers, or code, on flights operated by the other carrier). These programs enhance our revenue opportunities by:

• | increasing value to our customers by providing easier access to more travel destinations and better mileage accrual/redemption opportunities;


• | gaining access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and


• | providing members of our alliance partners' frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on our system while earning mileage credit in the alliance partners' programs.

Our marketing alliances with other airlines as of December 31, 2018 were as follows:
 | Hawaiian MilesFrequent FlyerAgreement | Other AirlineFrequent FlyerAgreement | Code-share—HawaiianFlight # on FlightsOperated by OtherAirline | Code-share—OtherAirline Flight # onFlights Operated byHawaiian
Air China | No | No | No | Yes 
American Airlines | No | Yes | No | Yes 
China Airlines | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes 
Delta Air Lines | No | Yes | No | Yes 
JetBlue | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes 
Korean Air | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes 
Philippine Airlines | No | No | No | Yes 
Turkish Airlines | No | No | No | Yes 
United Airlines | No | Yes | No | Yes 
Virgin Atlantic Airways | Yes | Yes | No | No 
Virgin Australia | Yes | Yes | No | Yes 

Although these programs and services increase our ability to be more competitive, they also increase our reliance on third parties.
Competition
The airline industry is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the airline industry are:

• | Fares;


• | Flight frequency and schedule;


• | Customer service;


• | On-time performance and reliability;


• | Name recognition;


• | Marketing affiliations;


• | Frequent flyer benefits;


• | Aircraft type;


• | Safety record; and


• | In-flight services.

Domestic—We face multiple competitors on our North America routes including major network carriers such as Alaska (AS), American Airlines (AA), United Airlines (UA), and Delta Airlines (DL). In addition, Southwest Airlines (WN) announced their intent to launch service to and from (and possibly within the islands of) Hawai'i in 2018. Various charter companies also provide non-scheduled service to Hawai'i, mostly under public charter arrangements. Our Neighbor Island competitors consist of regional carriers, which include Mokulele Airlines and a number of other "air taxi" companies.
International—Currently, we are the only provider of direct service between Honolulu and each of Sapporo, Japan; Pago Pago, American Samoa; and Papeete, Tahiti. However, we face multiple competitors from both domestic and foreign carriers on our other international routes.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 7,244 active employees, of whom approximately 84% were covered by labor agreements with the following organized labor groups:
Employee Group | Represented by | Number of Employees | Agreement amendable on (*)
Flight deck crew members | Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) | 800 | | July 1, 2022 
Cabin crew members | Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) | 2,101 | | January 1, 2017 (**)
Maintenance and engineering personnel | International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM-M) | 1,111 | | January 1, 2021 
Clerical | IAM-C | 2,031 | | January 1, 2021 
Flight dispatch personnel | Transport Workers Union (TWU) | 52 | | August 1, 2021 

(*) Our relations with labor unions representing our airline employees are governed by the Railway Labor Act of 1926. Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between us and the labor unions does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement.
(**) As of December 31, 2018, contract negotiations are ongoing with the AFA.
Seasonality
Hawai'i is a popular vacation destination for travelers. For that reason, our operations and financial results are subject to substantial seasonal and cyclical volatility, primarily due to leisure and holiday travel patterns. Demand levels are typically weaker in the first quarter of the year with stronger demand periods occurring during June, July, August, and December. We may adjust our pricing or the availability of particular fares to obtain an optimal passenger load factor depending on seasonal demand differences.
Customers
Our business is not dependent upon any single customer or a few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive and evolving international, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Many governmental agencies regularly examine our operations to monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Governmental authorities can enforce compliance with applicable laws and regulations and obtain injunctions or impose civil or criminal penalties or modify, suspend, or revoke our operating certificates in case of violations.
Industry Regulations
We are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The DOT has jurisdiction over international routes and fares for some countries (based upon treaty relations with those countries), consumer protection policies including baggage liability, denied boarding compensation, and unfair competitive practices as set forth in the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight operations, including equipment, ground facilities, security systems, maintenance, and other safety matters. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate that provides for the ongoing maintenance of our aircraft, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls.
Maintenance Directives
The FAA approves all airline maintenance programs, including modifications to the programs. In addition, the FAA licenses the repair stations and mechanics that perform inspections, repairs and overhauls, as well as the inspectors who monitor the work.
The FAA frequently issues airworthiness directives in response to specific incidents or reports by operators or manufacturers, requiring operators of specified equipment types to perform prescribed inspections, repairs or modifications within stated time periods or numbers of cycles. In the last several years, the FAA has issued a number of maintenance directives and other regulations relating to, among other things, wiring requirements for aging aircraft, fuel tank flammability, cargo compartment fire detection/suppression systems, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise abatement, and increased inspection requirements.

Airport Security
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) mandates that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provide screening of all passengers and property, including mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft. Under the ATSA, substantially all security screeners at airports are federal employees and airline and airport security is overseen and performed by federal employees, including security managers, law enforcement officers, and Federal Air Marshals. The ATSA also provides for increased security on flight decks of aircraft (and requires Federal Air Marshals to be present on certain flights), improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, provision of passenger data to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and enhanced background checks.
The TSA also has the authority to impose additional fees on air carriers, if necessary, to cover additional federal aviation security costs. 
Environmental and Employee Safety and Health
We are subject to various laws and regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business. Many aspects of airlines' operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign laws protecting the environment. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Certain of our operations are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that affect our operations. In addition to these federal activities, states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements, such as California.
The EPA is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Our aircraft comply with the existing EPA standards as applicable by engine design date.
We seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in our fuel consumption and other efforts. We have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet through the retirement and replacement of certain aircraft in our fleet with newer, more fuel efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. In 2012, we earned the first-ever aviation based carbon credits through the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions with the use of an eco-friendly engine washing technology. We are also supporting initiatives to develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S. as part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment.
Noise Abatement
Under the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, the DOT allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems, provided such procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate and foreign commerce, or the national transportation system. Certain airports, including the major airports at Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, California; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan, have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of such operations. Local authorities at other airports could consider adopting similar noise restrictions. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increases in operating costs, and such restrictions could limit our ability to expand our operations.
Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program
The U.S. Department of Defense regulates the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) and government charters. We have elected to participate in the CRAF program by agreeing to make aircraft available to the federal government for use by the U.S. military under certain stages of readiness related to national emergencies. The program is a standby arrangement that allows the U.S. Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command to call on as many as 12 contractually committed Hawaiian aircraft and crews to supplement military airlift capabilities. None of our aircraft are presently mobilized under this program.
Other Regulations
The State of Hawai'i is uniquely dependent upon air transportation. The Hawai'i state legislature has enacted legislation that reflects and attempts to address its concerns. For example, House Bill 2250 HD1, Act 1 of the 2008 Special Session, establishes 
7

a statutory scheme for the regulation of Hawai'i neighbor island air carriers, provided that federal legislation is enacted to permit its implementation. The U.S. Congress has yet to enact legislation that would allow this proposed legislation to go into effect.
Additionally, several aspects of airline operations are subject to regulation or oversight by federal agencies other than the FAA and the DOT. Federal antitrust laws are enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services provided by our cargo services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are generally regulated under the Railway Labor Act. We and other airlines certificated prior to October 24, 1978 are also subject to preferential hiring rights granted by the Airline Deregulation Act to certain airline employees who have been furloughed or terminated (other than for cause). The Federal Communications Commission issues licenses and regulates the use of all communications frequencies assigned to us and other airlines. There is increased focus on consumer protection both on the federal and state level. We cannot always accurately predict the cost of such requirements on our operations.
Additional laws and regulations are proposed from time to time, which could significantly increase the cost of airline operations by imposing additional requirements or restrictions. U.S. law restricts the ownership of U.S. airlines to corporations where no more than 25% of the voting stock may be held by non-U.S. citizens and the airline must be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. The President and two thirds of the Board of Directors and other managing officers must also be U.S. citizens. Regulations also have been considered from time to time that would prohibit or restrict the ownership and/or transfer of airline routes or takeoff and landing slots and authorizations. Also, the award of international routes to U.S. carriers (and their retention) is regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, which are amended from time to time. We cannot predict what laws and regulations will be adopted or what changes to international air transportation treaties will be adopted, if any, or how we will be affected by those changes.
