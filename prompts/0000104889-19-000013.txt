Item 1. Business.
Graham Holdings Company (the Company) is a diversified education and media company whose operations include educational services; television broadcasting; online, print and local TV news; home health and hospice care; and manufacturing. The Company’s Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan) subsidiary provides a wide variety of educational services, both domestically and outside the United States. The Company’s media operations comprise the ownership and operation of television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of seven television broadcast stations), plus Slate and Foreign Policy magazines; Panoply, a podcast technology and advertising company; and Pinna, an ad-free audio streaming service for children. The Company also owns home health and hospice providers, four industrial companies, two automotive dealerships and Social Code LLC, a marketing solutions provider. 
Financial information concerning the principal segments of the Company’s business for the past three fiscal years is contained in Note 19 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues for each segment are shown in Note 19 gross of intersegment sales. Consolidated revenues are reported net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed 0.1% of consolidated operating revenues.
The Company’s operations in geographic areas outside the U.S. consist primarily of Kaplan’s non-U.S. operations. During each of the fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, these operations accounted for approximately 24%, 25% and 25%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and the identifiable assets attributable to non-U.S. operations represented approximately 23% and 21% of the Company’s consolidated assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Kaplan International
Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe, the U.S. and the Asia Pacific region. Each of these businesses is discussed below.
Europe.  In Europe, KI operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the U.K. and Ireland: Kaplan UK, KI Pathways, KI English, Mander Portman Woodward, Dublin Business School and Kaplan Open Learning.
The Kaplan UK business in Europe, through Kaplan Financial Limited, is a provider of training, test preparation services and degrees for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In addition, Kaplan UK provides professional training. In 2018, Kaplan UK provided courses to over 50,000 students in accountancy and financial services. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 21 training centers located throughout the U.K.
The KI Pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study in English-speaking countries. In 2018, university preparation programs were delivered in Australia, China, Japan, Myanmar, Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S., serving approximately 12,000 students in partnership with more than 40 universities. 
The KI English business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English–proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. KI English operates a total of 37 English-language schools, with 19 located in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New 
1

Zealand and Canada and 18 located in the U.S. In 2018, KI English served approximately 36,000 students for in-class English-language instruction. 
Mander Portman Woodward (MPW) is a U.K. independent sixth-form college that prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that control admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. 
KI also operates Dublin Business School in Ireland, a higher education institution, and Kaplan Open Learning in the U.K., an online learning institution. At the end of 2018, these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 6,000 students. 
U.K. Immigration Regulations. Certain KI businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor students from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visas and Immigration Department (UKVI), the KI Pathways business is required to hold or operate Tier 4 sponsorship licenses for international students to be permitted to enter the U.K. to study the courses KI Pathways delivers. Two of the KI English schools also have Tier 4 licenses to enable them to teach international students, although students studying the English language may generally choose to enter the U.K. on a short-term study visa as opposed to a Tier 4 visa. 
Each Tier 4 license holder is required to have passed the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and hold Educational Oversight accreditation. Without these criteria being met, KI’s U.K. schools would not be permitted to issue a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies to potential incoming international students, which is a prerequisite to a student obtaining a Tier 4 student visa. The UKVI rules also require all private institutions to obtain Educational Oversight accreditation, which requires a current and satisfactory full inspection, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. For the seventh consecutive year, KI has retained 100% in Tier 4 Educational Oversight with high grades across all colleges, and all Tier 4 license renewals have been approved again with high scores in the core measurable requirements. KI English has two U.K. English-language schools listed on the Kaplan Tier 4 master license. The MPW schools each hold current Tier 4 licenses and have performed consistently well with good records in their Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED) and Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) Educational Oversight inspections. 
The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (HERA) received Royal Assent on April 27, 2017. HERA undertook a significant reform of regulation of the higher education sector in the U.K., including the formation of a new regulator, the Office for Students (OfS). The 2018–2019 academic year is a transition year under the new regulatory framework. The OfS has published regulatory guidance, including the new Regulatory Framework for Higher Education in England. All of KI’s higher education businesses in the U.K. will need to successfully complete registration with the OfS in 2019 to ensure that they continue operating and retain their Tier 4 sponsor licenses or continue to receive government student loan funding. Pathways institutions registered with the OfS will be, for the first time, recognized as Higher Education Providers, with students of approved providers having many of the same Tier 4 privileges as students of universities in the U.K. effective August 1, 2019. No assurance can be given that each KI business required to register with the OfS will be successful in doing so. Failure to register with the OfS would result in the loss of a Tier 4 license and, where relevant, inability to accept students funded by U.K. domestic student loans. Failure of one or more institutions to successfully register with the OfS would have a material adverse effect on Kaplan Europe’s operating results.
Changes continue to be made to U.K. immigration rules. The introduction of revised immigration rules has historically increased, and may continue to increase, KI’s operating costs in the U.K.
No assurance can be given that each KI business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Tier 4 BCA status and Educational Oversight/OfS accreditation or registration. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to attain. Loss of either Tier 4 BCA status or Educational Oversight/OfS accreditation or registration would have a material adverse effect on KI Europe’s operating results.
Impact of Brexit.  On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved a proposal that the U.K. leave the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The impact of Brexit on KI will depend, in part, on the outcome of future negotiations regarding the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU, possibly including any transition period or the outcome of any “no deal” exit. A “no deal” exit would occur if the U.K. government is not able to reach agreement with the EU on either transition arrangements or its future relationship with the EU upon exit. This risk increased following the rejection of the proposed transition arrangements by the U.K. Parliament on January 15, 2019. A U.K. exit on a “no deal” basis could adversely impact the value of the British pound as compared to other currencies or potentially have other adverse consequences and may have a materially adverse impact on KI’s results of operations. Uncertainty over the outcome of the negotiations and the possibility of a “no deal” exit may materially or significantly diminish interest in traveling to the U.K. for study. If the U.K. is no longer viewed as a favorable study destination, KI’s ability to recruit international students will be adversely impacted, 
2

which would result in material adverse impacts to KI’s results of operations and cash flows. The U.K. government’s Immigration White Paper, issued in December 2018, clarified that EU nationals’ ability to enter the U.K. for long- or short-term study will change. EU national students seeking to study higher education courses will be broadly subject to similar rules as those that presently apply to non-EU international students (KI Pathways). EU national students seeking to study English-language courses will either require an Electronic Travel Authorization or a short-term student visa (KI English). EU nationals do not currently require visas or face other administrative barriers to study in the U.K. It is also expected that recruitment of staff from outside the U.K will become more difficult and that Kaplan may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining international staff in the U.K. It is unclear how international student recruitment agents and prospective international students will view the U.K. as a study destination after the introduction of these new requirements, the EU exit negotiations and the U.K.’s eventual exit from the EU. The introduction of new visa and other administrative requirements, Brexit and the perception of the U.K. as a less favorable study destination may have a materially adverse impact on KI’s ability to recruit international students, KI’s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if the U.K. does not receive a determination of adequacy under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, then flows of personal data within KI or between KI and its clients, suppliers, business partners and affiliates may be substantially disrupted. The risks associated with Brexit may be mitigated, in part, by the possibility that a reduction in the value of the British pound against other international currencies may attract greater numbers of students to the U.K.
Asia Pacific.  In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and China.
In Singapore, Kaplan operates three business units: Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional. During 2018, the Higher Education and Financial divisions served more than 14,000 students from Singapore and 2,700 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. Kaplan Professional provided short courses to approximately 55,000 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2018. 
Kaplan Singapore’s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn Bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore’s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs.
Kaplan Singapore’s Financial business provides preparatory courses for professional qualifications in accountancy and finance, such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Kaplan Singapore’s Professional business, which is an authorized SkillsFuture Singapore Approved Training Organization, provides professionals with various skills training through workforce skills qualifications courses to help them rejoin the workforce, shift to new careers or catch up with changes that occur in the workplace.
In November 2018, Kaplan Singapore Professional received a notice from SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Education, that SSG would terminate Kaplan Singapore Professional’s right to deliver workforce skills qualifications (WSQ) courses under the Leadership & People Management framework for six months from December 1, 2018, due to issues relating to a small number of contractors, and restrict Kaplan Singapore from applying to teach any new WSQ programs for six months from the date of the notice. Kaplan Singapore Professional has accepted the decision from SSG and enhanced its compliance controls for all other frameworks of WSQ courses.
In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through Master’s level, together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, hospitality and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2018, these businesses provided courses to approximately 2,300 students through face-to-face classroom programs (within Kaplan Business School) and approximately 43,000 students through online or distance-learning programs offered by Kaplan Professional. 
Kaplan Australia’s English-language business is part of KI English, which operates across five locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, teaching more than 6,000 students in 2018. In 2018, the KI English School in Manly was sold to allow Kaplan to refocus its English-language training businesses on metropolitan areas in Australia. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KI Pathways. It consists of Murdoch Institute of Technology and the University of Adelaide College (formerly Bradford College) and offered face-to-face pathways and foundational education to more than 1,300 students wishing to enter Murdoch University in Perth and the University of Adelaide, respectively, in 2018. The contract with Murdoch University to run the Murdoch Institute of Technology will expire in 2020, and Kaplan has decided not to exercise its right to negotiate an extension of its contract.
Kaplan Australia also owns Red Marker Pty Ltd., a machine learning and artificial intelligence-based provider of regulatory software. Its Artemis product detects potentially non-compliant content as it is being created, helping 
3

advisers and licensees to identify and remediate compliance risks associated with the promotion of financial products or services. 
In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three main business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving approximately 13,000 students annually. 
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to approximately 11,000 students and business executives wishing to earn professional qualifications in accountancy, financial markets designations and other professional courses.
Hong Kong’s Language Training division offers both test preparation for overseas study and college applications, including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 1,000 students.
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to approximately 1,000 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students earn Doctorate, Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through Kaplan Business and Accountancy School.
In 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties have incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan CITIC Education Co. Limited, which is 49% owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company is carrying out publishing and distribution of Kaplan Financial training products in China (including CFA, FRM and ACCA) and is expanding its business with other Kaplan divisions under an intellectual property license from Kaplan. 
Each of Kaplan’s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate. The degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions, which can make compliance challenging. No assurance can be given that Kaplan will successfully comply with all applicable foreign regulations, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect Kaplan’s operating results.
Kaplan Higher Education
Until March 22, 2018, Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) provided postsecondary education services to students through Kaplan University’s (KU) online and fixed-facility colleges. KU provided a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals.
On March 22, 2018, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to a new university: an Indiana non-profit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University, known as Purdue University Global (Purdue Global). As part of the transfer to Purdue Global, KU transferred students, academic personnel, faculty and operations, property leases for KU’s campuses and learning centers and KHE-owned academic curricula and content related to KU courses. At the same time, KU and Purdue Global entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA) pursuant to which KHE provides key non-academic operations support to Purdue Global. Kaplan received nominal cash consideration upon the transfer of the institutional assets and operations of KU.
The transfer of KU did not include any of the assets of the KU School of Professional and Continuing Education, which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures, nor did it include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses.
KHE’s Third-Party Service Operations
KHE’s primary business operations are providing non-academic operations support services to Purdue Global pursuant to the TOSA and similar services to Purdue University and other institutions of higher education. Purdue Global operates largely online as an Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue University. The operations support activities that KHE provides to Purdue Global include technology support, help-desk functions, human resources support for transferred faculty and employees, admissions support, financial aid processing, marketing and advertising, back-office business functions, certain test preparation and domestic and international student recruiting services.
Pursuant to the TOSA, KHE is not entitled to receive any reimbursement of costs incurred in providing support functions, or any fee, unless and until Purdue Global has first covered all of its operating costs (subject to a cap). If Purdue Global achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, it may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (Purdue Efficiency Payment). In addition, during each of Purdue Global’s first five years, prior to any payment to KHE, Purdue Global is entitled to a priority payment of $10 million per year beyond costs. To the extent Purdue Global’s revenue is insufficient to pay the priority payment, KHE is required to advance an amount to Purdue Global to cover such insufficiency. Upon closing of the transaction, Kaplan paid to Purdue 
4

Global an advance in the amount of $20 million, representing, and in lieu of, priority payments for Purdue Global’s fiscal years ending June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020.  
To the extent that there is sufficient revenue to pay the Purdue Efficiency Payment, Purdue Global will be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap), and the priority payment to Purdue Global is paid. To the extent that there is remaining revenue, KHE will then receive reimbursement for its operating costs (subject to a limit) of providing the support activities. If KHE achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, then KHE may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (KHE Efficiency Payment). If there are sufficient revenues, KHE may also receive a fee equal to 12.5% of Purdue Global’s revenue. The fee will increase to 13% beginning with Purdue Global’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, through Purdue Global’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2027. Thereafter, the fee will return to 12.5%. Subject to certain limitations, a portion of the fee that is earned by KHE in one year may be carried over and instead paid to KHE in subsequent years. After the first five years of the TOSA, KHE and Purdue Global will be entitled to payments in a manner consistent with the structure described above, except that (i) Purdue Global will no longer be entitled to a priority payment and (ii) to the extent that there are sufficient revenues after payment of the KHE Efficiency Payment (if any), Purdue Global will be entitled to an annual payment equal to 10% of the remaining revenue after the KHE Efficiency Payment (if any) is paid, subject to certain other adjustments.
The TOSA has a 30-year initial term, which will automatically renew for five-year periods unless terminated. After the sixth year, Purdue Global has the right to terminate the agreement upon payment of a termination fee equal to 1.25 times Purdue Global’s revenue for the preceding 12-month period, which payment would be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KHE to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. At the end of the 30-year term, if Purdue Global does not renew the TOSA, Purdue Global will be obligated to make a final payment of 75% of its total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment will be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KHE to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. Either party may terminate the TOSA at any time if Purdue Global generates (i) $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years or (ii) aggregate cash operating losses greater than $75 million at any point during the initial term. Operating loss is defined as the amount of revenue Purdue Global generates minus the sum of (1) Purdue Global’s and KHE’s respective costs in performing academic and support functions and (2) the $10 million priority payment to Purdue Global in each of the first five years. Upon termination for any reason, Purdue Global will retain the assets that Kaplan contributed pursuant to the Transfer Agreement. Each party also has certain termination rights in connection with a material default or material breach of the TOSA by the other party.
Regulatory Environment
KHE no longer owns or operates KU or any other institution participating in student financial aid programs that have been created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (Higher Education Act), as amended (Title IV). KHE is a service provider to Purdue Global and other Title IV participating institutions. As a service provider under the U.S. Department of Education (ED) regulations, KHE is required to comply with certain laws and regulations, including applicable statutory provisions of Title IV. KHE also provides financial aid services to Purdue Global, and as such, meets the definition of a “third-party servicer” contained in the Title IV regulations. By virtue of being a third-party servicer, KHE is also subject to applicable statutory provisions of Title IV and ED regulations that, among other things, require KHE to be jointly and severally liable with Purdue Global to the ED for any violation by Purdue Global of any Title IV statute or ED regulation or requirement. Pursuant to ED requirements, Purdue is responsible for any liability arising from the operation of the institution; however, pursuant to the agreement to transfer KU, KHE agreed to indemnify Purdue for certain pre-closing liabilities. KHE also is subject to other federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, information security requirements established by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the applicable provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regarding the privacy of student records. 
KHE’s failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in adverse consequences to KHE’s business, including, for example:

• | The imposition on KHE of fines or repayment obligations for Title IV funds to the ED or the termination or limitation on KHE’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to Purdue Global or any other Title IV participating institution;


• | Adverse effects on KHE’s business and results of operations from a reduction or loss in KHE’s revenues under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution if a client institution loses or has limits placed on its Title IV eligibility, accreditation, operations or state licensure, or is subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to non-compliance by KHE (or the institution) with Title IV, accreditor, federal or state agency requirements;

5


• | Liability under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution for non-compliance with federal, state or accreditation requirements arising from KHE’s conduct; and


• | Liability for non-compliance with Title IV or other federal or state laws and regulations occurring prior to the transfer of KU to Purdue.

Incentive compensation. Under the ED’s incentive compensation rule, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds if such payment is based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. KHE is a third party providing bundled services to Title IV participating institutions that include recruiting and, in the case of Purdue Global, financial aid services. As such, KHE is also subject to the incentive compensation rules and cannot provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any covered employees, subcontractors or other parties engaged in certain student recruiting, admission or financial aid activities based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. In addition, tuition revenue sharing payments to KHE under the TOSA (as well as any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution) must comply with revenue sharing guidance provided by the ED related to bundled services agreements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Failure to Comply With the ED’s Title IV Incentive Compensation Rule Could Subject Kaplan to Liabilities, Sanctions and Fines for more information.
Misrepresentations. A Title IV participating institution is required to comply with the ED regulations related to misrepresentations and with related federal and state laws. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and may extend to statements by servicers, such as KHE, that provide marketing or certain other services to such institutions. The laws and regulations may also apply to KHE’s employees and agents, with respect to statements addressing the nature of an institution’s programs, financial charges or the employability of its graduates. KHE provides certain marketing and other services to Title IV participating institutions. A violation of misrepresentation regulations or other federal or state laws and regulations applicable to the services KHE provides to its client institutions arising out of statements by KHE, its employees or agents could require KHE or its clients to pay the costs associated with indemnifying its client institutions from applicable losses. Additionally, failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in the imposition on KHE of fines or federal student aid repayment obligations to the ED or the termination or limitation on KHE’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to Purdue Global or any other Title IV participating institution.
Compliance reviews and litigation. As a third-party servicer providing financial aid services to a Title IV participating institution, KHE is subject to reviews, audits, investigations and other compliance reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies and auditors, including, among others, the ED, the ED’s Office of the Inspector General, accrediting bodies and state and various other federal agencies. These compliance reviews can result in findings of non-compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements that can, in turn, result in the imposition of fines, liabilities, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions against KHE. KHE will be required, if it enters into contracts to provide financial aid services to more than one Title IV participating institution, to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of KHE’s compliance with applicable ED requirements.
On February 23, 2015, the ED began a program review assessing KU’s administration of its Title IV and Higher Education Act programs during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 award years. In 2018, Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to Purdue Global, and the university became Purdue Global, under the ownership and control of Purdue University. However, Kaplan retains liability for any financial obligations the ED might impose under this program review and that are the result of actions taken during the time that Kaplan owned the institution. On September 28, 2018, the ED issued a Preliminary Program Report (Preliminary Report). This Preliminary Report is not final, and the ED may change the findings in the final report. None of the initial findings in the Preliminary Report carries material financial liability. Although the program review technically covers only the 2013–2015 award years, the ED included a review of the treatment of student financial aid refunds for students who withdrew from a program prior to completion in 2017–2018. KHE cannot predict the outcome of this review, when it will be completed, whether any final findings of non-compliance with financial aid program or other requirements will impact KHE’s operations, or what liability or other limitations the ED might place on KHE or Purdue Global as a result of this review. 
There are also two open program reviews at campuses that were part of the KHE Campuses business prior to its sale in 2015 to Education Corporation of America. The ED’s final reports on the program reviews at former KHE Broomall, PA, and Pittsburgh, PA, locations are pending. KHE retains responsibility for any financial obligations resulting from these program reviews.
Prior to the transfer to Purdue Global of the institutional assets and operations of KU, on September 3, 2015, Kaplan sold to Education Corporation of America (ECA) substantially all of the assets of KHE’s nationally accredited on-ground Title IV eligible schools (KHE Campuses). As part of the transaction, similar to the transfer of KU, Kaplan retained liability for the pre-sale conduct of the KHE schools. Although Kaplan no longer owns KU or the KHE Campuses, Kaplan may be liable to the current owners of KU and the KHE Campuses, respectively, for the pre-sale 
6

conduct of the schools. Kaplan may also have liabilities in connection with certain real estate leases that were guaranteed by Kaplan.
Compliance by client institutions with Title IV program requirements and other federal, state and accreditation requirements. KHE currently provides services to education institutions that are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations and subject to extensive accrediting body requirements. Presently, a substantial portion of KHE’s revenues are attributable to service fees it receives under the TOSA, which are dependent upon revenues generated by Purdue Global and dependent upon Purdue Global’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV federal student aid program. To maintain Title IV eligibility, Purdue Global and KHE’s other client institutions must be certified by the ED as eligible institutions, maintain authorizations by applicable state education agencies and be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ED. Purdue Global and KHE’s other client institutions must also comply with the extensive statutory and regulatory requirements of the Higher Education Act and other state and federal laws and accrediting standards relating to their financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, disbursement and return of Title IV funds, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made by the school and various other matters. Additionally, Purdue Global and other client institutions are subject to laws and regulations that, among other things, limit student default rates on the repayment of Title IV loans; permit borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loans based on certain conduct of the institution; establish gainful employment requirements, including certain debt-to-earnings metrics; establish specific measures of financial responsibility and administrative capability; and require state authorization and institutional and programmatic accreditation. If Purdue Global or other client institutions lose or have limits placed on their Title IV eligibility, accreditation or state licensure, or if they are subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to their or KHE’s non-compliance with Title IV regulations, accreditor or state agency requirements or other state or federal laws, KHE’s financial results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, any legislative, regulatory or other development that has the effect of materially reducing the amount of Title IV financial assistance or other federal, state or private financial assistance available to the students of KHE’s client institutions could have a material adverse effect on KHE’s business and results of operations. 
Kaplan Test Preparation
In 2018, Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) included test preparation, data science education and training and healthcare simulation businesses. Each of these businesses is discussed below. On February 28, 2018, Kaplan acquired the assets of i-Human Patients, Inc., a company that provides online, simulated patient interactions for use in training and assessing medical health professionals. On September 14, 2018, Kaplan acquired the test prep, study aid and foreign language assets of Barron’s Educational Series. The acquisition included the “Barron’s” name and approximately 650 titles covering all test prep and study aid assets, as well as foreign language, reference, business and law titles.
Test Preparation.  KTP’s admissions businesses prepare students under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron’s Educational Series brands for a broad range of standardized, high-stakes tests, including the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE. KTP’s accredited businesses, operating under the Kaplan Prep & Achieve brand, prepare students for licensing exams required to enter certain professions, including nursing schools, medical schools and law schools. KTP also sells admissions consulting, tutoring and other advising services.

(a) Source: 2018/2019 Local Television Market Universe Estimates, The Nielson Company, September 2018, based on television homes in DMA (see note
 (b) below).
(b) Full-power commercial TV stations, Designated Market Area (DMA) is a market designation of The Nielsen Company that defines each television market exclusive of another, based on measured viewing patterns.
In January 2017, GMG acquired WCWJ, a CW affiliate television station in Jacksonville, FL, and WSLS, an NBC affiliate television station in Roanoke, VA. GMG operates both stations under the network affiliations in effect prior to their acquisition. 
Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2018, advertising revenue accounted for 68.5% of the total for GMG’s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station’s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for air time; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends, among others.
Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters
GMG’s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period.
Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues.  Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) now broadcasts only in digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming and multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting). 
8

Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations, that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers’ ability to receive television stations’ signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC’s decision to allow electronic devices, known as “white space” devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. 
In November 2017, the FCC voted to adopt rules authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard is designed to allow broadcasters to provide consumers with better sound and picture quality; hyper-localized programming, including news and weather; enhanced emergency alerts and improved mobile reception. The standard also allows for the use of targeted advertising and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same six-megahertz channel. ATSC 3.0 is not backwards compatible with existing television equipment, and the FCC’s recently adopted rules require full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. A transitioning station’s DTV-formatted content must be substantially similar to the programming aired on its ATSC 3.0 channel for at least five years.
In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of an incentive auction in which certain broadcast television stations bid to relinquish spectrum or move to a different spectrum band in exchange for a share of the revenues obtained by auctioning the reallocated broadcast spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers. None of GMG’s stations won the incentive auction. However, certain GMG stations—specifically, WDIV, WSLS, WCWJ and WJXT—will be required to move to new channel allotments so as to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The FCC has adopted rules requiring this “repacking” of broadcast television stations to new channels to be completed within 39 months after the incentive auction closed, with earlier deadlines set for particular stations in order to stagger the transition to new channels. The scheduled transition deadlines for GMG’s repacked stations are as follows:

• | WSLS: September 6, 2019


• | WCWJ and WJXT: January 17, 2020


• | WDIV: March 13, 2020

The repacking and incentive auction processes could have an adverse effect on GMG. For example, the repacking of GMG’s stations and/or neighboring stations may result in increased interference to the GMG stations’ signals or otherwise affect the stations’ over-the-air coverage. Although GMG’s repacked stations are eligible to seek reimbursement for repacking-related costs, the initial legislation authorizing the incentive auction provided only $1.75 billion in total for all such reimbursements. In March 2018, Congress allocated an additional $1 billion for the repack, including funds that could be used toward reimbursing expenses for “repacked” low-power television (LPTV) stations and TV translators.
From late 2017 through April 2018, the FCC issued a series of Public Notices announcing the reimbursement estimates for all entities eligible for reimbursement, after such estimates were reviewed and adjusted by the FCC’s reimbursement fund administrator and then further adjusted to reflect the additional congressional appropriation. To date, each repacked commercial television station, including each of the repacked GMG stations, has been allocated a reimbursement amount equal to approximately 92.5% of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator. Receipt of the allocation funds is subject to FCC approval of particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs fully incurred. 
The FCC adopted rulemaking in August 2018 addressing a number of issues, including the amount of funds that should be made available for reimbursements for LPTV and TV translator stations. This proceeding is still ongoing, so the Company cannot predict the extent to which the GMG stations will be compensated for any non-full-power television expenses that they incur in connection with the repacking. 
Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals.  Congress has established, and periodically has extended or otherwise modified, various statutory copyright licensing regimes governing the local and distant carriage of broadcast television signals on cable and satellite systems. The Company cannot predict whether or how Congress may maintain or modify these regimes in the future, nor what net effect such decisions would have on the Company’s broadcast operations or on the Company overall.
The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station’s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forego must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a “retransmission consent” agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems that provide “local-into-local” service (i.e., to distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). Stations that elect retransmission 
9

consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG’s television stations has elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators, and each is carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station’s respective local market pursuant to retransmission consent agreements. 
The FCC has considered proposals to alter its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations, network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity. For example, pursuant to the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), enacted in December 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting same-market television broadcast stations from coordinating or jointly negotiating for retransmission consent unless such stations are under common control, and it considered, though ultimately did not adopt, changes to its “good faith” standards for retransmission consent negotiations. In addition, the FCC in March 2014 solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, which restrict the ability of cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicating programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. The FCC has not acted on that proposal to date. If Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the retransmission consent and/or exclusivity rules, such changes could materially affect the GMG stations’ bargaining position in future retransmission consent negotiations.
Ownership Limits.  The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. In November 2017, the FCC voted to eliminate certain of these restrictions and modify others. For instance, the FCC voted to eliminate a standard known as the “Eight Voices Test,” which generally prohibited two commercial television stations in the same market from combining ownership if the transaction would result in fewer than eight independently owned stations remaining in the market. This change to the local television ownership (or “duopoly”) rule means that the ownership rules generally will permit a party to own up to two commercial television stations in a market so long as one of the stations is not among the top-four ranked television stations in that market. The FCC voted to retain the existing prohibition on transactions that would result in common ownership among the top-four ranked stations in the same market, subject to potential exceptions to the prohibition based on public interest showings made on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the FCC voted to eliminate the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which had prohibited a single entity from owning a full-power broadcast station and a daily print newspaper in the same local market, and the television/radio cross-ownership rule, which imposed specific limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market (in addition to the separate limits on the number of television or radio stations a party could own in the market). The FCC also voted to eliminate a rule making certain television joint sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. The FCC will continue to require public disclosure of certain shared services agreements (SSAs) though these agreements are not considered attributable. The changes adopted in the FCC’s November 2017 order have been challenged in court. In addition, in December 2018, the FCC initiated a statutorily mandated Quadrennial Review of its broadcast ownership rules to determine whether they continue to serve the public interest. GMG’s ability to enter into certain transactions in the future may be affected by the outcome of the court challenges as well as the FCC’s Quadrennial Review proceeding.
In addition, by statute, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as such interest complies with the FCC’s other ownership restrictions. The FCC in 2016 eliminated the 50% “Ultra High Frequency (UHF) discount,” under which stations broadcasting on UHF channels are credited with only half the number of households in their market for purposes of calculating compliance with the 39% cap. However, the FCC reversed that decision in early 2017, concluding that the UHF discount should not be altered except in connection with a broader review of the national ownership cap. The reinstatement of the UHF discount was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2018. 
In a December 2017 rulemaking, the FCC initiated a new proceeding to seek comments regarding its authority to modify or eliminate the national ownership cap, as well as the potential elimination of the UHF discount. The FCC has received comments on its rulemaking but has not yet implemented final rules.
Programming.  Six of GMG’s seven stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks that provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of GMG’s affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of this Television Broadcasting section. WJXT, one of GMG’s Jacksonville stations, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the GMG stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG’s performance depends, in part, on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future.
Public Interest Obligations.  To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children’s programming. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to 
10

determine whether certain of these requirements should be modified to provide broadcasters more flexibility in meeting the public interest obligations. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children’s programs. 
The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the disclosure of certain information and documents in an online public inspection file; rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the Internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG’s operations. However, the FCC has taken some measures to reduce burdens related to keeping physical copies of licenses posted and submitting paper copies of contracts, for example. The FCC also has an open proceeding to determine whether to remove other filing requirements.
Political Advertising.  The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG’s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG’s television stations during the periods preceding elections.
Broadcast Indecency.  The FCC’s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC may impose monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC’s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters’ programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for “fleeting expletives” were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate broadcast decency. The Company cannot predict how GMG’s stations may be affected by the FCC’s current or future interpretation and enforcement of its indecency policies. 
Other Matters. The FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various matters in addition to those described in this section. The outcome of these proceedings and other matters described in this section could adversely affect the profitability of GMG’s television broadcasting operations.

Competition
Kaplan
Kaplan’s businesses operate in fragmented and competitive markets. Each of Kaplan International’s (KI) businesses competes in disaggregated markets with other for-profit institutions and companies (ranging in size from large for-profit universities to small competitors offering English-language courses) and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Competitive factors vary by business and include program offerings, ranking of university partners, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost. KI derives its competitive advantage from, among other things, delivering high-quality education and training experiences to students, having name brand recognition across multiple markets, developing strong relationships with corporate clients and recruitment partners and offering competitive pricing. Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) competes with companies that provide technology solutions, administrative support, curriculum development, overall online program development and analytics for colleges and universities, as well as support for corporate, employer and employee education programs.The market for KHE products and services is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and several competitors offer a mix of some of the same products and services or seek to move into KHE’s markets. Competitive factors in KHE’s markets include the ability to deliver a wide range of educational services and programs to clients across all levels of programs and administrative functions; cost effectiveness; expertise in marketing, recruitment and program delivery; student outcomes and satisfaction; the ability to invest in start-up and scaling initiatives; reputation; and compliance with laws and ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements. KHE’s ability to effectively compete will depend in large part on its successful delivery and navigation of these factors. While the competitive landscape is expanding, KHE’s resources, capabilities and experience are key differentiators in the market. Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) competes with a wide range of national, regional, local, online and location-based competitors. Competitors vary by test, with many competitors focused on preparing students for a single high-stakes test. For its curricular and assessment services, KTP has a number of national competitors, including, for example, ATI/Ascend Learning and HESI/Elsevier. Competitive factors vary by product line, and include price, features, modality, schedule and reputation. Although KTP faces intense competition and shifting consumer preferences, particularly with respect to online test prep, KTP remains a leading name in test prep due, in part, to its technical expertise and capabilities, quality of instructors, content and curricula and longevity in the industry. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) (KP) offers a broad portfolio of products, many within highly regulated and mature industries, including securities, insurance, real estate and wealth management, where competition includes a wide variety of national, regional and local companies seeking the same market share and resulting in deep price discounting and commoditization of offerings. 
Graham Media Group
GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems and video services offered by telephone companies serving the same or nearby areas; with DBS services; and, to a lesser degree, with other media, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company’s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on a pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. Moreover, to the extent that competing television stations in the Company’s television markets transition to ATSC 3.0, such stations may pose an increased competitive challenge to the Company’s stations, such as by offering an increased number of multicast channels and/or by offering advanced features. 
Competition also continues to increase from established and emerging online distribution platforms. Movies and television programming increasingly are available on an on-demand basis through a variety of online platforms, which include free access on the websites of the major TV networks, ad-supported viewing on platforms such as Hulu and subscription-based access through services such as Netflix. In addition, online-only subscription services offering live television services have been launched both by traditional pay-TV competitors (such as DISH and DirecTV) and new entrants (such as Sony). The Company has entered into agreements for some of its stations to be distributed via certain of these services, typically through opt-in agreements negotiated by the stations’ affiliated networks. Participation in these services has given the Company’s stations access to new distribution platforms. At the same time, competition from these various platforms could adversely affect the viewership of the Company’s 
13

television stations via traditional platforms and/or the Company’s strategic position in negotiations with pay-TV services. In addition, the networks’ increased role in negotiating online distribution arrangements for their affiliated stations may have broader effects on the overall network-affiliate relationship, which the Company cannot predict.
Hoover
Hoover’s predominant product line is fire-retardant treated wood products for building interior applications that are specified by architects in accordance with building code requirements for multi-family residential, commercial and institutional nonresidential buildings. Hoover’s fire-retardant product lines are sold through a stocking distributor network of more than 100 locations spanning the U.S. and Canada. Hoover’s competitors are licensees of other chemical suppliers to the wood treating industry who compete with Hoover’s stocking distributors on a local basis. The primary areas of competition are product availability and price, although brand loyalty due to product quality is significant. Wood products are commodities with volatile market pricing; however, Hoover’s reputation for quality products and its unique distribution model, which provides superior product availability, enable Hoover to maintain a leading position across the continent.
Dekko
Dekko has three distinct product families that compete in fragmented, competitive global markets: power and data distribution for office and furniture products; lighting solutions; and electrical harness manufacturing. These products are sold through dealer and distribution channels and OEM customers—focused primarily on the North American market. While all markets and products are price sensitive, technology, engineering solutions, quality and delivery performance are critical in purchase decisions. Dekko’s multiple long-term relationships, high-quality manufacturing facilities, engineering support and reputation as a solutions provider, in addition to being a product supplier, all contribute to sustaining its competitive advantages.
Graham Healthcare Group
The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and non-profit companies. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s March 2018 report, there are approximately 12,000 Medicare-certified home health providers and approximately 4,500 hospice providers in the United States. GHG markets its services to physicians, discharge planners and social workers at hospitals, nursing homes, senior living communities and physician offices through a direct sales model. GHG differentiates its offering based on response time, clinical programming, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Throughout the three states in which it operates, GHG competes primarily with both privately owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers. 
SocialCode
The business of managed digital advertising is highly competitive. Public multinational advertising agencies may exacerbate price competition in an attempt to protect existing relationships with advertising clients in traditional media formats such as television. Public and private advertising technology companies, digital media agencies and newer market entrants such as consulting firms also compete on price, service and technology offerings. SocialCode seeks to maintain a competitive advantage and maximize its clients’ return on advertising budgets by utilizing a combination of the deep expertise of its employees, who manage media spending on the largest digital platforms; a proprietary software (SaaS) as a service platform, allowing clients to make better use of first-party and third-party data to increase advertising effectiveness; and a full-service creative team with a nuanced understanding of digital media.
Panoply
Panoply provides podcast technology for publishers and advertisers through the Megaphone platform and Megaphone Targeted Marketplace (MTM). Megaphone, a proprietary SaaS platform, provides hosting and dynamic advertising insertion for publishers. Megaphone operates in a small but competitive market and competes primarily on the basis of product performance, price and service.
