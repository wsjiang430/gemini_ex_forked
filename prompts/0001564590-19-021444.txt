Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 Organovo Holdings, Inc. (“Organovo Holdings,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “our Company”) is a biotechnology company pioneering the development of bioprinted human tissues that emulate human biology and disease. Initially, we are developing our in vivo liver tissues to treat end-stage liver disease and a select group of life-threatening, orphan diseases, for which there are limited treatment options other than organ transplantation. Our objective is to serve as a ‘bridge-to-transplant’ for these patients, with an ultimate goal of delaying or reducing the overall need for transplant. The Company’s program focused on an orphan disease known as Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (“A1AT”), received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) orphan drug designation in December 2017. We are also utilizing our foundational ability to isolate highly specialized human cells to build robust, functional human tissues by creating a range of novel preclinical in vitro disease modeling platforms, including a broad set of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) conditions. Our clients can access these diseased tissue platforms through collaborative, revenue-generating agreements. 
 In May 2019, we announced our plans to conduct additional preclinical studies and to optimize our manufacturing processes and complete additional preclinical studies that generate consistent scientific data regarding the prolonged functionality and therapeutic benefits of our in vivo liver tissues. We also announced that these efforts would extend our preclinical development efforts into calendar 2020. Our decision to complete additional studies and to optimize our manufacturing processes resulted from data generated from a larger group of animal studies that differed from our earlier pilot studies. These studies continued to show statistically meaningful reductions in toxic globules in the A1AT animal models over a three-month period. However, in these and other animal models, we observed shorter tissue duration than we observed in our pilot studies, as measured by human protein output and the quantity of hepatocytes. 
 As we focus our efforts on our in vivo tissue development efforts, we intend to be increasingly selective about pursuing and entering into collaborative and revenue-generating agreements for our in vitro disease models. Our in vitro and in vivo tissues are both built upon the same proprietary 3D bioprinting technology and our highly specialized cells. As a result, we intend to enter into collaborative, revenue-generating agreements where the scientific outcomes are complementary to our key regulatory goals for our in vivo tissues.
 Over the long-term, we intend to focus on achieving the following key milestones:
  
• | One or more successful IND submissions, leading to the initiation of Phase I clinical studies involving implantation and functional evaluation of our liver therapeutic tissue patch in target disease patients;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Achieving key FDA designations associated with tissue-based approaches that address serious unmet medical needs in rare disease indications, which can include Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”), Orphan Drug, Fast Track and Breakthrough designations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deploying of proof-of-concept disease modeling capabilities in NASH to enable high content drug profiling collaborations with current and prospective clients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Developing our Samsara Sciences, Inc. (“Samsara”) division’s cell-based product revenue opportunities, as well as continuing to generate revenue from grant and licensing agreements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Achieving operational breakeven profitability for our commercial business by securing selected revenue-generating fee-based service agreements and collaborations and creating business opportunities which may lead to valuable spin-out and/or partnering opportunities; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing academic, partner and internal research programs to generate additional, high value tissue applications and therapeutics pipeline opportunities in other organ and disease areas.

Our Platform Technology 
 Our 3D human tissue platform is enabled by our proprietary NovoGen Bioprinters® and related technologies for preparing bio-inks and bioprinting multicellular tissues with complex architecture. We believe the tissue-like configuration of our 3D human tissues make them ideally suited as implantable tissue patches for augmentation or replacement of organ function and for the assessment of drug safety and efficacy. Our foundational proprietary technology, grounded in over a decade of peer-reviewed scientific publications, derives from research led by Dr. Gabor Forgacs, the former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biological Physics at the University of Missouri-Columbia. We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property rights covering the principles, enabling instrumentation, 
 2


applications, and methods of cell-based printing, including exclusive licenses to certain patented and patent pending technologies from the University of Missouri-Columbia and Clemson University. We have continued to develop our technology and grow our intellectual property portfolio. In addition to our in-licensed patents, we own more than 100 additional patents and pending applications worldwide covering specific tissue designs, uses, and methods of manufacture. We believe that our broad and exclusive commercial rights to patented and patent-pending 3D tissues and related bioprinting technology provide us with a strong and defensible market position for the successful commercialization of 3D bioprinted human tissues to address a broad array of unmet preclinical and clinical needs.
 The key distinguishing features of our bioprinted 3D human tissues are their dense cellularity and the controlled patterning of specific cell types relative to each other, both of which are enabled by our proprietary bio-inks and bioprinters. Unlike the majority of engineered tissue strategies, where biomaterials such as fixed scaffolds are the major component of the tissue and cells are present in relatively low proportions, our platform builds tissues that are comprised primarily of human cells. We primarily focus on the use of human cells as inputs, yielding functional models of human tissue that can be used in vitro for drug discovery and development. In addition, complex bioprinted human tissues may also address unmet clinical needs by serving as tissue grafts for the augmentation or replacement of functional mass in tissues and organs that are damaged by trauma or disease
 Our Market Opportunity 
 We believe that our proprietary 3D bioprinting platform can enable us to deliver functional human tissues to multiple clinical markets for direct therapeutic purposes and to the drug discovery and development market for the creation and optimization of novel therapeutic treatments:

1) | Implantable 3D Tissues for Therapeutic Use: We have identified several target diseases where there are significant unmet needs that can potentially be addressed by our tissue platform. The FDA is currently providing significant development and financial incentives to pursue diseases involving serious, unmet orphan conditions and/or involving breakthrough regenerative medicine treatment strategies, which are strongly aligned with our technology platform. Our ultimate goal is to construct surgically implantable tissues that restore significant function to a damaged tissue or organ after delivery. It is our belief that, in most cases, whole organ replacement may not be required to achieve meaningful clinical outcomes and address unmet medical needs. We believe 3D tissues with well-defined architecture and composition can create a new product category within cell and tissue therapies. Our future tissue products may include bioprinted tissues (patches, tubes, etc.) or hybrids comprised of bioprinted tissues and device component(s). We are currently self-funding the development of our in vivo liver tissue. In the future, we may develop specific tissue targets with partners through technology licenses and royalty-bearing deals.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 During the past several years, we have implanted our 3D bioprinted human liver tissue patches onto the livers of diseased mice, and through serum and histopathologic evaluation of the implanted therapeutic tissue, showed engraftment, retention and the potential for disease modification in two different disease models. Our results have demonstrated the important presence of key human liver proteins such as albumin and A1AT in the animal bloodstream. In addition, our pathologic evaluation of diseased animals receiving our implanted bioprinted liver tissues in an earlier A1AT study suggested an approximately 75 percent reduction in the pathologic hallmarks of the disease in the livers of treated animals versus non-treated animals in the region of implant. During more recent studies, while continuing to see this significant reduction in the pathologic hallmark of the disease, our tissues have also shown a shorter duration and functionality than what was reflected in our earlier pilot studies. This will require us to further optimize the manufacturing process and complete additional preclinical studies that generate consistent confirmatory data on the sustained functionality and therapeutic benefits of our liver tissue patch necessary to move forward with development.
  
2) | 3D Tissue Models for Drug Discovery and Development: Our NovoGen® bioprinting platform can produce highly specialized human tissues that model human biology and disease. We have used our bioprinting platform to create a wide array of proof-of-concept studies developing human tissue constructs, including blood vessels, liver tissues, skin tissues, kidney tissues, lung tissues, intestinal tissues and tissues with tumors. Our 3D bioprinted tissues possess unique features, including cell type-specific compartments, prevalent intercellular tight junctions and microvascular structures. These features facilitate the development of complex, multicellular disease models for use in the development of targeted therapeutics for bowel disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease and oncology. We have demonstrated that our ExVive™ Human Liver Tissue is capable of modeling the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), whereby immune competent bioprinted tissues containing Kupffer cells were exposed to steatogenic cues via a nutrient overload approach of simple sugars and fatty acids, followed by inflammatory stimulation using prototypical inducers. Key features of NASH such as steatosis, increased inflammatory cytokine release, hepatic stellate cell activation, and subsequent fibrogenesis, which are often lacking in other commercially available liver disease models, are attainable in our ExVive™ Liver Tissue via a nutrient overload approach, analogous to diets high in fat and sugar and inflammatory stimuli. The longevity of our ExVive™ Liver Tissue, which is typically several weeks, allows for the testing of several

induction strategies such as various dosing and durations of insults (nutrients, inflammatory inducers, xenobiotics), and also has the potential to enable the study of multiple, modulatory approaches to profile prophylactic and treatment-oriented drug strategies. Together, these features suggest that our ExVive™ Human Liver Tissue holds promise for the study of complex, chronic conditions such as NASH, which may enable a better understanding of disease processes, lead to the discovery of novel therapeutics, facilitate target identification and validation, facilitate the identification of potential biomarkers, and allow for the safety assessment of drugs in a disease-relevant background.

3) | Procurement of Specialized Human Cells for Use in Customer’s Research Programs: In January 2016, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara Sciences, Inc. (“Samsara”). Samsara is an important source for the provision and delivery of a broad range of primary human liver cells to facilitate customer research studies. Samsara also supports our own R&D mission by providing high-quality cell-based products that form the building blocks of our therapeutic tissues and custom disease models. In November 2018, we partnered with the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (“IIAM”) for receiving donated organs designated for research and clinical use.

The NovoGen Bioprinter® Platform 
 Our NovoGen Bioprinters® are automated devices that enable the fabrication of 3D living tissues comprised of mammalian cells. A custom graphic user interface (“GUI”) facilitates the 3D design and execution of scripts that direct precision movement of multiple dispensing heads to deposit defined cellular building blocks called bio-ink. Bio-ink can be formulated as a 100% cellular composition or as a mixture of cells and other matter (hydrogels, particles). Our NovoGen Bioprinters® can also dispense pure hydrogel formulations provided the physical properties of the hydrogel are compatible with the dispensing parameters. Most typically, hydrogels are deployed to create void spaces within specific locations in a 3D tissue or to aid in the deposition of specific cell types. We are able to employ a wide variety of proprietary cell- and hydrogel-based bio-inks in the fabrication of tissues. Our NovoGen Bioprinters® also serve as important components of our tissue prototyping and manufacturing platform, as they are able to rapidly and precisely fabricate intricate small-scale tissue models for in vitro use as well as larger-scale tissues suitable for in vivo use. 
 Generation of bio-ink comprising human cells is the first step in our standard bioprinting. A wide variety of cells and cell-laden hydrogels can be formulated into bio-ink and bioprinted tissues, including cell lines, primary cells, and stem/progenitor cells. The majority of tissue designs employ two or more distinct varieties of bio-ink, usually comprised of cells that represent distinct compartments within a target tissue. For example, a 3D liver tissue might consist of two to three distinct bio-inks that are each made from a single cell type, a combination of cell types, and/or a combination of primary cells and one or more bio-inert hydrogels that serve as physical supports for the bioprinted tissue during its maturation period, or to transiently occupy negative spaces in a tissue design. 
 Research Collaborations 
 We currently collaborate with several academic institutions by providing them with access to our NovoGen Bioprinters® for research purposes, including: Yale School of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”), Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (“OHSU”), the National Eye Institute (“NEI”), the University of Virginia (“UVA”), and Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (“MCRI”), the Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia and Ton Rabelink at Universiteit Leiden, Netherlands. We believe that the use of our bioprinting platform by major research institutions will help to advance the capabilities of the platform and generate new applications for bioprinted tissues including proof-of-concept exploration of kidney, eye, and vasculature tissue constructs, ultimately creating future opportunities for our commercial products and intellectual property licensing. In some instances, an academic institution or other third party has provided funding to support the academic collaborator’s access to our technology platform. This funding is typically reflected as collaboration revenues in our financial statements. Our research collaborations typically involve both us and the academic partner contributing resources directly to projects, but also may involve sponsored research agreements where we fund specific research programs. We may also contribute a bioprinter and technical support or a bioprinter and research headcount, depending on the project scope. 
Samsara Sciences, Inc. (“Samsara”)
 In January 2016, we announced that Samsara commenced commercial operations. We formed Samsara to serve as a key source of certain of the primary human cells we utilize in our products and services and in the development of our therapeutic products. We believe Samsara can help us optimize our supply chain and reduce operating expenses related to cell sourcing and procurement and ensure that the cellular raw materials we use are of the highest quality and are derived from tissues that are ethically sourced in full compliance with state and federal guidelines. Samsara provides us with qualified liver cells for use in our liver tissue manufacturing, and certain other human cells for use in our preclinical research and development programs. In addition to serving as one of our key suppliers, Samsara offers human cells for use by life science customers, both directly and through distribution partners.

Competition 
 We are subject to competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies; academic and research institutions; and government or other publicly-funded agencies that are pursuing the development of tissue models and therapeutic products targeted to our potential customers and market opportunities. We believe our future success will depend, in large part, on our ability to maintain a first mover advantage and competitive lead in our industry. 
 Set forth below is a discussion of the competitive factors for each of the markets in which we intend to utilize our technology: 
  
1) | Implantable 3D Tissues for Clinical Use: This aspect of our business involves application of our 3D bioprinting technology to generate human tissues suitable for implantation in vivo to augment or replace damaged or degenerating tissues. Our platform has the ability to generate and optimize unique or hybrid tissue prototypes. We may undertake these efforts alone, or as partnered projects with leading therapeutic companies seeking to develop a tissue product for a specific application. Primarily, our clinical competition may come from other biotech companies targeting small and large molecule strategies, gene therapies, gene editing approaches and other cellular therapy approaches for treating one or more of the same diseases we elect to target. For instance, we may face future competition from companies such as Arrowhead Therapeutics, Promethera, Mereo Biopharma, AGTC, Grifols SA, and Kamada. These companies uniquely represent potential competition for us while also being partner candidates.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Models for Drug Discovery and Development: This aspect of our business is driven by leveraging our technology as a high-end partnered service that designs and delivers highly complex, custom tissue models of normal or diseased tissue for use in drug discovery and development. Each model is designed to enable a customer to discover or optimally formulate a pharmacologic product that delivers a specific therapeutic effect or avoids a particular side effect. Competition in this area arises mainly from two sources, traditional cell-based in vitro culture approaches and traditional in vivo animal models and testing. We may also face future competition from companies like Cyfuse Biomedical (including service companies using their instrument platform), Emulate, Hesperos, HemoShear, Mimetas, Ascendance/Hepatopac, InSphero, and CN Bio Innovations. We believe that an important factor distinguishing our approach from that of our competitors is our ability to build models that are composed primarily of human cells and have a 3D tissue-like configuration (i.e., able to generate results that are not subject to inherent limitations of 2D monolayer culture). We acknowledge, however, that there are some areas of research for which the existing methods (2D cell culture and/or animal studies) are adequate and 3D in vitro human tissues are not sufficiently advantageous.

Research and Development 
 We continuously engage in research and development to enhance our platform technology to pursue our therapeutic initiatives. Our research and development efforts include internal initiatives as well as collaborative development opportunities with third parties. As noted above, we currently intend to focus our efforts on examining and optimizing our manufacturing processes, with the goal of improving the durability and functionality of our in vivo liver tissues. In the future, we plan to focus our research and development activities in areas where we have technological expertise and where we believe a significant market opportunity exists for our technology and the pipeline products we develop. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to establish and protect our proprietary bioprinting technologies and our engineered tissue products and services. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, confidential know-how, copyrights and a variety of contractual mechanisms such as confidentiality, material transfer, licenses, research collaboration, limited technology access, and invention assignment agreements, to protect our intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio for our core technology was initially built through licenses from the University of Missouri-Columbia (“MU”) and the Medical University of South Carolina. We have subsequently expanded our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent and trademark applications worldwide and negotiating additional licenses and purchases.
 We solely own or hold exclusive licenses to 21 issued U.S. patents and more than 40 issued international patent applications. We solely or jointly own or hold exclusive licenses to 19 pending U.S. patent applications and more than 80 pending international applications. These patent families relate to our bioprinting technology and our engineered tissue products and services, including its various uses in areas of tissue creation, in vitro testing, utilization in drug discovery, and in vivo therapeutics.

In-Licensed IP
 In 2009 and 2010, we obtained world-wide exclusive licenses to intellectual property owned by MU and the Medical University of South Carolina, which now includes 6 issued U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. applications, 16 issued international patents and 1 pending international application. Dr. Gabor Forgacs, one of our founders and a former George H. Vineyard Professor of Biophysics at MU, was one of the co-inventors of all of these works (collectively, the “Forgacs Intellectual Property”). The Forgacs Intellectual Property provides us with intellectual property rights relating to cellular aggregates, the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissues, and the use of cellular aggregates to create engineered tissue with no scaffold present. The intellectual property rights derived from the Forgacs Intellectual Property also enables us to utilize our NovoGen MMX Bioprinter® to create engineered tissues. 
 In 2011, we obtained an exclusive license to a U.S. patent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,051,654) owned by the Clemson University Research Foundation that provides us with intellectual property rights relating to methods of using ink-jet printer technology to dispense cells and relating to the creation of matrices of bioprinted cells on gel materials. 
 In 2015, we obtained world-wide exclusive licenses to intellectual property owned by The University of Queensland (collectively, “UniQuest Intellectual Property”) relating to technologies for producing kidney cells and kidney organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). At the time, Professor Melissa Little and her team at The University of Queensland developed a method of growing kidney tissue from iPSCs for potential use in drug screening, disease modeling and cell therapy. Professor Little’s research was eventually published in 2015 in the prestigious scientific journal Nature. Currently, the UniQuest Intellectual Property includes 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 2 issued international patents and 15 pending international patent applications.
 The patent rights we obtained through these exclusive licenses are not only foundational within the field of 3D bioprinting but provide us with favorable priority dates. We are required to make ongoing royalty payments under these exclusive licenses based on net sales of products and services that rely on the intellectual property we in-licensed. For additional information regarding our royalty obligations see “Note 7. Licensing Agreements and Research Contracts” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 
 Company Owned IP
 In addition to the IP we have in-licensed, we have continued to innovate and grow our IP portfolio.
 With respect to our bioprinting platform, we have 7 issued U.S. patents and 11 issued foreign patents directed to our NovoGen MMX Bioprinter® and methods of bioprinting: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,931,880; 9,149,952; 9,227,339; 9,499,779; 9,315,043; 9,855,369; and 10,174,276; Australia Patent Nos. 2011318437, 2015202836, 2016253591, and 2013249569; China Patent Nos. ZL201180050831.4 and ZL201480054148.1; Hong Kong Patent No. HK1187024; Israel Patent No. 225392; Japan Patent No. 6333231; Russia Patent No. 2,560,393; and Singapore Patent No. 11201600770R. We have additional U.S. continuation applications pending in these families as well foreign counterpart applications in multiple countries. We intend to continue pursuing patent protection as we continue to innovate the design, features, and functionality of our bioprinter platform and bioprinting methods.
 We are also pursuing U.S. and foreign patents covering our 3D bioprinted tissues and methods of fabricating such tissues. Our ExVive™ Human Liver Tissue is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 9,222,932 and 9,442,105; Singapore Patent No. 11201507202Y; Israel Patent No. 241055; Australia Patent No. 2014236780; Canada Patent No. 2,903,844; and Russia Patent No. 2625016. U.S. Application No. 15/166,006 and China Application No. 201480028365.3 have been allowed and will also grant as patents. Our ExVive™ Human Kidney Tissue is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 9,481,868 and 10,094,821. We have additional U.S. patent applications pending in these families, as well as foreign counterpart applications in multiple countries. We currently have pending numerous patent applications in the U.S. and globally that are directed to additional tissue types, their methods of fabrication, and specific applications. We intend to continue filing additional patent applications as we continue to innovate in this area.
 Additionally, in 2013, we purchased the exclusive rights to “Perfusion Bioreactors for Culturing Cells” (U.S. Patent No. 7,767,446, Japan Patent No. 4,914,835, and Australia Patent No. 2,005,287,162) from Becton Dickinson and Company. This patent represents the acquisition of bioreactor technology for the support of our 3D tissues for use in drug discovery and development. 
 We believe that protection of the proprietary nature of our bioprinting technologies and products and services is essential to our business. Accordingly, we have adopted and will continue a vigorous program to secure and maintain protection of our intellectual property. Under this program, we intend to continue to file patent applications with respect to novel technology, and improvements thereof, that are important to our business. This program may also feature out-bound patent licensing of some or all of our IP portfolio. We also will continue to rely upon trade secret and confidential know-how protection of our methods and technology, including our proprietary in-house manufacturing methods and in vitro testing methods. As with other areas of biotechnology, this provides a critical adjunct to the protection offered by patents. As always, we continue to pursue our internal technological innovation and external 
 6


licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology or that we can meaningfully protect our proprietary position.
 Regulatory Considerations 
 Therapeutic tissues and other regenerative medicine products are subject to an extensive, lengthy and uncertain regulatory approval process by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. The regulation of new products is extensive, and the required process of laboratory testing and human studies is lengthy and expensive. For example, as our therapeutic tissue constructs move into clinical and commercial settings, full compliance with the FDA’s cGTP (current Good Tissue Practices), cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practices), and cGCP (current Good Clinical Practices) guidelines will be required. Suitable design and documentation for clinical use of the bioprinter will be a part of future phases of our NovoGen Bioprinter® design programs.
 The process required by the FDA under the drug provisions of the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act before our initial therapeutic tissue products may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | Preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | Submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the tissue candidate for its intended use;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a Biologic License Application (“BLA”); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of a BLA.
--+----------------------------------

 The resource investment of time, staff and expense to satisfy these regulations will fall on us for the proprietary products we are developing on our own. We may not be able to obtain FDA approvals for those products in a timely manner, or at all. We may encounter significant delays or excessive costs in our efforts to secure necessary approvals or licenses. Even if we obtain FDA regulatory approvals, the FDA extensively regulates manufacturing, labeling, distributing, marketing, promotion and advertising after product approval. Moreover, several of our product development areas may involve relatively new technology and have not been the subject of extensive product testing in humans. The regulatory requirements governing these products and related clinical procedures remain uncertain and the products themselves may be subject to substantial review by the FDA and/or foreign governmental regulatory authorities that could prevent or delay approval of these products and procedures. Regulatory requirements ultimately imposed on our products could limit our ability to test, manufacture and, ultimately, commercialize our products and thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Raw Materials 
 We use live human cells to produce our 3D tissues. We source cells only from suppliers who have provided assurances that their cells come from tissues that were (1) collected in compliance with applicable laws, and (2) provided based on informed consent by the donors. We formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Samsara, in 2016 to serve as a key source of the primary human cells we use in our products and services and in the development of therapeutic products. Samsara is currently supplying us with qualified human liver and kidney cells for use in manufacturing our ExVive™ Human Liver Tissue and ExVive™ Human Kidney Tissue, as well as certain specialized cells for research and development activities. We believe that Samsara can help us optimize our supply chain and reduce operating expenses and ensure that the human cells we use for our services, products and research and development programs are of the highest quality and are derived from tissues that are ethically sourced in full compliance with state and federal guidelines. In addition to Samsara, we also purchase human cells from selected third-party suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements. 
Employees 
 As of June 1, 2019, we had approximately 61 employees, all of which were full-time. We also engage consultants and temporary employees from time to time to provide services that relate to our bioprinting business and technology as well as for general administrative services.
