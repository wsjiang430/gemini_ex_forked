Overview
 
AVRA was organized by a senior leadership team with broad and deep experience in medical research, innovation and development in the medical robotics field. The Company plans to exploit the growing demand for practical medical robotic devices by developing a platform-independent precision guidance system, applicable to a variety of minimally and non-invasive procedures, with an initial focus on skin resurfacing. The Company believes that its team, which has been active in the medical robotics field for a number of years, brings the necessary skills and experience to develop and commercialize intelligent medical robotic systems, as well as in marketing, chain management, and the implementation of all other aspects of business operations. The Company believes that progress in mechanical and software engineering has made possible lightweight and relatively inexpensive robotic devices for difficult procedures in various medical fields.
 
Medical robots are already being successfully employed in several areas of surgery, including Urology (Prostate), Colo-Rectal, Gynecology, Thoracic, General Surgery, Neuro and Spine Surgery. Robots are also being used for Tele-medicine and assistive robotic methods are addressing the delivery of healthcare in inaccessible locations, ranging from rural areas lacking specialist expertise to post-disaster and battlefield areas. With the aging population dominating demographics in the U.S. across all spectrums of health care, robotic technologies are being developed toward promoting improved function, less morbidity and improved overall outcomes.
 
Today, the U.S. is the leader in robot-assisted surgery for the possibility of cure and improved quality of life. However, other countries are fast followers, having already recognized both the need and the promise of such technologies. The development of surgical robotics is motivated by the desire to enhance the effectiveness of a procedure by coupling information to action in the operating room or interventional suite, and transcend human physical limitations in performing surgery and other interventional procedures, while still affording human control over the procedure. Two decades after the first reported robotic surgical procedure, surgical robots are now being widely used in the operating room. Surgical robots are beginning to realize their potential in terms of improved accuracy and visualization(1), as well as enabling new procedures.
 
Current robots used in surgery are under the direct control of a surgeon – the so-called “Master-slave system,” often in a teleoperation scenario in which a human operator manipulates a master input device and the patient-side robot follows the input. In contrast to commonly held beliefs where robots are autonomous, traditional minimally invasive surgical robots provide the surgeon with a higher degree of dexterity inside the body, eliminate operator tremor, scale down operator motions to a fraction of normal distances, and provide a very intuitive connection between the operator and the instrument tips. The surgeon can cut, cauterize, suture and reconstruct tissue with accuracy equal to or better than that of invasive open surgery. A surgical system contains both robotic devices and real-time imaging devices to visualize the operative field during the course of surgery.
 
The use of robotics in medicine inherently involves physical interaction between caregivers, patients, and robots – in all combinations. Developing user-friendly physical interfaces between humans and robots requires all the classic elements of a robotic system: sensing, perception, and action. A great variety of sensing and perception tasks are required, including recording the motions and forces of a surgeon to infer their intent, determining the mechanical parameters of human tissue, and estimating the forces between a rehabilitation robot and a moving stroke patient. The reciprocal nature of interaction means that the robot will also need to provide useful feedback to the human operator, whether that person is a caregiver or a patient. We need to consider systems that involve many human senses, the most common of which are vision, haptics (force and tactile), and sound. In management’s opinion, a major reason why systems involving physical collaboration between humans and robots are so difficult to design well is that, from the perspective of a robot, humans are extremely uncertain and dynamic.

Unlike in a passive, static environment, humans dynamically change their motion, force, and immediate purpose throughout a procedure. These changes can be caused by something as simple as physiologic movement (e.g., a patient breathing during surgery), or as complex as the motions of a surgeon suturing during surgery. During physical interaction with a robot, the human is an integral part of a closed-loop feedback system, simultaneously exchanging information and energy with the robotic system, and thus cannot simply be thought of as an external system input. In addition, the loop is often closed with both human force and visual feedback, each with its own errors and delays that can potentially cause challenges in a human-robot system. Given these problems, how does one guarantee safe, collaborative and useful physical interaction between robots and humans? Management believes that to date, no existing system provides the user with an ideal experience of physically interacting with a robot.
 
AVRA’s overall design strategy, as opposed to that used in most non-autonomous systems, is to integrate image-guidance with navigation and organ-targeting to result in a medical robotic system that is truly diverse and multi-dimensional. Having identified limitations in the predominantly non-autonomous systems, AVRA proposes to employ a disruptive model in the design and development process, which considers design and development through a seamless collaboration of surgeons, engineers and scientists. Past efforts in medical robotics have generally been led by either the surgeons, the engineers, or the scientists, but rarely via a collaboration of all three. AVRA has been making a proactive effort to use this collaborative approach in all its development work.
 
For skin resurfacing, AVRA plans to incorporate recent technological improvements in motors, materials and high-resolution imaging to develop robotic device that will allow a surgeon to autonomously or semi-autonomously treat damaged skin. The basic principle behind the initial technology that AVRA is working on automating is the controlled delivery of micro skin injuries to stimulate remodeling of existing collagen and promote the formation of new collagen, elastin, and vascularization in the papillary dermis, which results in the reduction in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin laxity, and scarring. Some of the advantages of using a robot for skin resurfacing can include greater precision, better visualization, quick automated adjustments during a procedure and shorter times. Presently, we are not aware of any commercially available robotic devices designed for this application.
 
AVRA is currently developing its initial intelligent medical robotic system for facial corrections (i.e., skin resurfacing) in partnership with the University of Central Florida (“UCF”), pursuant to a research agreement initially entered into with UCF effective as of May 1, 2016 and subsequently amended and extended (the “Research Agreement”). UCF is recognized particularly for its work in the area of medical robotic research and design, focusing on the guidance systems. We anticipate that application of this expertise will allow AVRA’s medical robotic system to handle a wide array of the currently available “tools” in the market. The Company’s plans to target a large market for its initial robotic system, which currently includes such solutions as Botox and CO2 lasers used for keratosis removal and treatment of scarring, discoloration and other skin problems that are often difficult to treat.
 
Moreover, while AVRA is in development of its robotic system and anticipates that it is ready to build a prototype, to date we have no products or training programs approved or ready for retail marketing and there can be no assurance as to when products will be ready to reach market. Unanticipated delays in market readiness will substantially harm the Company’s prospects.
 
To date, the Company has not generated revenues and has operated with limited capital. The Company will require significant capital to implement its business plan. There can be no assurance that the Company can raise the necessary funds, on favorable terms or otherwise. Failure to obtain sufficient capital will substantially harm the Company’s prospects.

Current Market
 
The concept of using a robot in surgical procedures became a practical reality in 2000 when the FDA approved the da Vinci® robot, introduced to the market by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (“ISRG”). For years, ISRG was, as essentially the only game in town, alone in enjoying the explosive growth in the rapidly emerging field of robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”).
 
The global medical robots market is expected to grow to $11.4 billion by 2020 from $4.2 billion in 2015 at a combined annual growth rate of 22.2%(2).
 
As seen in the following charts, the non-surgical segment of the skin resurfacing market, the target for AVRA’s first planned medical robotic system, has enjoyed explosive growth and is foreseen to continue its fast growth in the near future:

As of 2013, there were an estimated 9,600 dermatologists and 7,800 dermatology practices in the U.S. according to IMS Health; approximately, 34% of these are solo practices, while approximately 48% are multi-physician (three or more physicians) practices.
 
Most products designed to improve the appearance of the skin do not repair the skin itself; rather, they cover and hide scarring and blemishes temporarily. Wrinkles also are challenging as the skin ages and are hard to cover over. Some current products aim to slow or forestall the development of wrinkles, but with questionable effectiveness.
 
Botox injections and CO2 Lasers are the common procedures currently in use today for skin resurfacing. Other procedures include Needling, Radiofrequency, Ultrasound, and Cryolipolysis.
 
Botox injections have proved successful for cosmetic enhancement because it shrinks wrinkles dramatically. Botox has enjoyed rapid growth in sales and number of procedures (now about 7 million annually in the U.S. alone)(4). The downside of Botox is pain during the procedures and the need for repeated treatments given the temporary nature of the results achieved.
 
CO2 Laser resurfacing also can shrink wrinkles, even eliminating small wrinkles by removing the outer layer of skin, allowing new skin to form. While simple, this procedure can be painful. Laser resurfacing works by burning off skin; skin can reach 1500°F (800°C) in the process of being removed, and adjacent areas of skin can approach 400°F. (Unsurprisingly, general anesthesia is often required.) Open wounds are created and healing may take up to three weeks. Skin redness may persist for three months, during which the skin is particularly sensitive to UV light. Other risks of laser resurfacing include scarring, changes in skin pigmentation and bacterial infection.
 
Because wrinkles are a major cosmetic concern of both men and women alike, AVRA believes that a robotic system that actually reduces and eliminates wrinkles with minimal side effects has great market potential. Although no such product currently exists, AVRA intends to focus its initial efforts on addressing this void by being the first to develop, commercialize and market a medical robotic system to aid in skin resurfacing.
 
Efficiently to Market with a Superior Solution
 
AVRA believes that its resurfacing solution will be superior to Botox injections and CO2 Laser treatments, while being price competitive. Botox needs to be repeated every few months and the cost of acquiring a CO2 Laser, where a very basic model starts at approximately $50,000 but can be much higher than that, can be prohibitive.
 
AVRA plans to use a treatment delivered by a robotic device that improves the appearance of skin beyond wrinkle elimination. AVRA plans to integrate an existing procedure’s tool that has already received FDA approvals as a stand-alone procedure and adapt it to its robotic system. AVRA has researched many procedures and is currently finalizing its choice of the most appropriate procedure and tool for its robotic system. The basic principle behind the initial technology that AVRA is working on automating is the controlled delivery of micro skin injuries to stimulate remodeling of existing collagen and promote the formation of new collagen, elastin, and vascularization in the papillary dermis, which results in the reduction in appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin laxity, and scarring
 
The Company believes that the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness of its planned technology, which underlying technology will have already received FDA 510(k) approvals by other users of the technology (the “Technology”), for the same application of skin resurfacing, but without any automation, will afford a significant medical and competitive advantage as employed by AVRA.
 
Upon the completion and testing of its prototype, AVRA intends to commence the FDA approval process for its initial application. Since the Company plans to use a device that has already received FDA 510(k) approval, the Company should be in a better position to advance the robotic control of this device. This process may take anywhere from six months to two years but the Company hopes to minimize this time by going through a pre-meeting with the FDA and thus reduce the list of issues it will have to respond to once studies commence. Costs for this process, in the Company’s estimation, can range anywhere from $200,000 to $500,000.

The use of a robotic system will ensure accuracy, speed and minimize human error while also allowing doctors to increase their productivity by performing more procedures daily.
 
The Company believes it can rapidly develop, commercialize and market its initial medical robotic system because of the following advantages:
 

● | AVRA has substantially completed the design phase and is ready to build a prototype.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AVRA’s team is experienced in medical robotic engineering.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | The underlying technology has already received FDA approvals for skin resurfacing which the Company anticipates will allow for a sharply reduced time to market when applying for approval of the technology integrated with our planned medical robotic system. Numerous companies manufacture the underlying technology and AVRA is working on selecting a manufacturer but as of this date has not entered into any agreements.

Product Elements
 
There are four key elements to the Company’s medical robotic devices, all of which can potentially generate revenues:
 

● | Robotic Systems: | Standardized arms, precision guidance system, and software controls designed to the needs of doctors and physicians.
--+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robotic Tools: | Standardized tools that can be modified to cover a wide range of medical procedures. 
● | Maintenance: | Ongoing operation and service simplified so the medical user can perform much of the work in house. 
● | Education, Training: | Remote and on-site programs for surgeons, hospitals and medical support staff. 

Marketing Strategy
 
AVRA and its management team have relationships with many top medical institutions as of the result of their combined years of experience and expertise in exploring new designs for medical robotic systems. Moreover, the Company’s Medical Advisory Board consists of some of the most experienced(5) robotic surgeons in the world who are working to develop new, cutting edge procedures. As a result, AVRA believes that it will be able to capitalize on its experience and relationships to successfully develop, commercialize and launch a new system that it believes will be welcomed into hospital skin resurfacing departments, as well as into individual and skin resurfacing groups. The Company plans to handle initial sales on a direct basis to departments and practices through its extensive contacts in the medical industry.
 
AVRA plans to initially place the new AVRA Skin Resurfacing Robotic System into some of the major respected hospital names in the US. The Company already has relationships with many of these. AVRA will then leverage this into the larger skin resurfacing market with a direct cost-effective marketing plan that includes well known social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Vimeo.
 

(5) For example, AVRA Medical Advisory Board members Dr. Vipul Patel and Dr. Nikhil Shah have already performed more than 10,000 and 6,000 DaVinci robotic surgeries, respectively.

Due to the large market it addresses, the AVRA Skin Resurfacing Robotic System is expected to produce a much higher degree of interest and throng of inquiries than what the internal robotic surgical medical field would generate. The Company anticipates that this will help the company drive patient business directly to our AVRA Skin Resurfacing Robotic System’s doctors and centers.
 
AVRA will utilize the internet to answer the many expected inquiries and will upgrade its website(s) to automatically handle and direct these when appropriate.
 
Development Strategy
 
Effective as of May 1, 2016, the Company entered into the Research Agreement with UCF for the development of a prototype surgical robotic device supporting minimal invasive surgical facial corrections. The Agreement provides that UCF will provide personnel to accomplish the objectives as stated in the Statement of Work over a period which initially extended to June 30, 2017. The Statement of Work includes the development of prototype navigation and control software for the robotic medical device and the integration of all the necessary subcomponents. The Company has agreed to provide funding of $163,307 for the project. Effective May 1, 2017, the Research Agreement with UCF has been extended to June 30, 2019. This has no effect on any previous agreements or deliverables between AVRA and UCF, but rather allows AVRA to continue working with UCF on an ongoing basis without having to resubmit or restart any administrative requirements. No additional payments to UCF are required pursuant to the amendment.
 
In addition, AVRA has paid $43,548 for acquisition of the intellectual property developed by UCF pursuant to collaboration, which amount is capitalized. Other intellectual property costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed the carrying value of the asset and believes there has been no diminution of its value and accordingly, no adjustment is necessary.
 
The total cost to the Company is:
 

Research Expense - funded from existing funds | $ | 163,307
----------------------------------------------+---+--------
Acquisition of Intellectual Property Rights | | 43,548 
Total | $ | 206,855

 
As of December 31, 2016, $125,202 has been paid under the Research Agreement. The balance of the amount owing to the University was due November 1, 2016 ($40,827) and February 1, 2017 ($40,826). Both balances due have been fully paid on February 24, 2017 and on April 7, 2017, respectively. Additionally, a $68,952 matching funds grant from the Florida High Tech Corridor Council (FHTCC) was approved on July 16, 2016 which will provide UCF research funds in addition to the Company’s funding obligation to the University. The FHTCC research grant is subject to certain research obligations and action requirements which if not met may result in the loss of the FHTCC research funding which would require the Company to cover any resulting shortfall.
 
Intellectual Property
 
In connection with the design of its planned medical robotic systems, AVRA has applied for six provisional patents so far, will review existing patents in the United States and the European Union to reduce the risk of infringement claims and will file patent applications as its product development proceeds for elements of its products which qualify for patent protection.
 
The Company intends to file, as necessary, patent applications in the United States, as well as in other jurisdictions where it intends to distribute its products and where the dates of our initial patent applications will give us a right of priority.
 
Patents are granted for a fixed term and eventually expire. Upon expiration, the inventions claimed in a patent enter the public domain. There is no assurance that our patent applications will be granted or that patents granted will prevent others from developing competing products.

Government Regulation
 
Our products and operations will be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and by similar agencies in other countries or regions in which we may market our products.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we intend to market in the U.S. must first receive either “510(k) clearance” or “Premarket (PMA) approval” from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will be obtained in the future for any product we propose to market.
 
The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to request 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” in intended use, safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed “predicate device” that is either in class I, class II, or is a “pre-amendment” class III device, one that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval.
 
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Such devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction.
 
A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with CGMP and QSR requirements, which include elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. During the FDA’s review, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, likely will be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panel’s recommendation is important to the FDA’s overall decision-making process. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an “approvable letter” requiring the applicant’s agreement to comply with specific conditions or to supply specific additional data or information in order to secure final PMA approval.
 
Once the approvable letter conditions are satisfied, the FDA will issue a PMA order for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA order can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in an enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. The PMA process can be expensive and lengthy, and no assurance can be given that any PMA application will ever be approved for marketing. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.
 
A clinical trial may be required to support a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. Such trials generally require an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed an insignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the IDE. Trials must be conducted in conformance with FDA regulations and institutional review board requirements. The sponsor or the FDA may suspend these trials at any time if they are deemed to pose unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in the way they are being conducted. Data from clinical trials are often subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent FDA approval.

We will be subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
In order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products may harm our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this prospectus the Company employs six persons, including its executive officers. The Company also relies on independent third-party consultants to perform additional services as needed. As we implement our business plan and subject to the availability of capital, additional employees will be hired in the future as our business expands.
