     Item 1. Business
     General
     Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) is an information technology (“IT”) channel company. The Company operates through two reportable operating segments. The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software and hardware to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide. The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada. We offer an extensive line of products from leading publishers of software and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.
     The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1982. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”) is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “WSTG”. Our main web site address is www.waysidetechnology.com, and the other web sites maintained by our business include www.lifeboatdistribution.com and www.techxtend.com. Reference to these “uniform resource locators” or “URLs” is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only. Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.

    In our Lifeboat Distribution segment, we distribute technology products from software developers, publishers or equipment manufacturers to resellers, and system integrators worldwide. We purchase software, maintenance/service agreements, networking/storage/security equipment and complementary products from our vendors and sell them to our reseller customers. Generally, a vendor authorizes a limited number of companies to act as distributors of their product and sell to resellers of their product. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national IT superstores. We combine our core strengths in customer service, marketing, distribution, credit and billing to allow our customers to achieve greater efficiencies in time to market in the IT channel in a cost-effective manner. 
     Our Lifeboat Distribution business is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, and price competition. In our Lifeboat segment, we are highly dependent on the end-market demand for the products we sell, and on our partners’ strategic initiatives and business models. This end-market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new products, replacement and renewal cycles for existing products, competitive products, overall economic growth and general business activity. A difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the industry and increased price-based competition. 
     We also provide comprehensive IT solutions directly to end users through our TechXtend segment. Products in this segment are acquired directly from equipment manufacturers, software developers or distributors and sold to end users. We provide customer service, billing, sales and marketing support in this segment and provide extended payment terms to facilitate sales.
     The Company operates a distribution facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. 
     Products
     An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we become authorized distributors of their products. The Company sells a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Dell/Dell Software, erwin, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Micro Focus, Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Unitrends and VMware. On a continuous basis, we screen new vendors and products for inclusion in our line card based on their

features, quality, price, profit margins and current market trends. The Company predominantly sells third party software, software subscriptions, and maintenance. Sales of hardware and peripherals represented 22%, 16%, and 17% of our overall net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
     Marketing and Distribution
     We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, events, webinars, and social media. We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers. We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers. These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
     The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated net sales for 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, CDW Corporation (“CDW”) and Software House International Corporation (“SHI”), accounted for 25.6%, and 16.6%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2018, 35.6% and 15.0%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2017, CDW and SHI accounted for 18.0%, and 20.1%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and as of December 31, 2017, 28.2%, and 14.9%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, CDW and SHI accounted for 17.3%, and 16.3%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. Our top five customers accounted for 55%, 50%, and 46% of consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer’s order. This results in minimum backlog in the business.
     Net sales to customers in Canada represented 7%, 7%, and 8% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net sales in Europe and the rest of the world represented 6%, 7%, and 6% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 10 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
     Customer Support
     We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth. Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, returns processing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability. The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products.      Purchasing and Fulfillment
     The Company’s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace. The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its vendors. The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs. As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers. Substantially all the Company’s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days’ notice or less. Moreover, the way software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand. Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company’s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
     We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Sophos and SolarWinds accounted for 23.9% and 15.3%, respectively of our consolidated purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Sophos and SolarWinds accounted for 26.4% and 14.7%, respectively of our consolidated purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sophos and SolarWinds accounted for 23.1% and 10.8%, respectively, of our consolidated purchases. The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.

     The Company purchased approximately 97%, 96% and 96% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the balance from multiple distributors. Most suppliers or distributors will “drop ship” products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company. Inventory management techniques, such as “drop shipping” allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or cost of carrying inventory.
     Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company’s practice of making advance purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products. Moreover, the Company’s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping. The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange (“EDI”) with its suppliers and customers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all the product categories we carry.
     Competition
     The software market is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices by both software distributors and resellers. This has resulted in declining gross margins as a percentage of sales, which the Company expects to continue. The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources competing principally based on price, product availability, customer service and technical support. In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent, who also sell directly to the end-customers. In the TechXtend segment, we compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products. In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. 
     There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company. An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
     The Company competes with other distributors and resellers to become an authorized distributor or reseller of products from software developers and publishers. It also competes with distributors and resellers to attract prospective buyers, and to source new products from software developers and publishers, and to market its current product line to customers. The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of the desired IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively. The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily based on its reputation for successfully bringing new products to market and the strength of and quality of its relationships with software publishers and the reseller community.
     The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications. The way software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand. Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices. From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts and renewals of maintenance agreements. These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers. While some software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels. There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do. Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third-

party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
     In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services. Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to “Item 1.A. Risk Factors”: “We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell”, and “The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business.”
     Information Technology
     The Company operates the IT systems on several platforms including Windows and cloud-based platforms that control the full order processing cycle. The technology systems allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution and payment processing. We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our technology systems, telephone systems, websites, e-mail and EDI systems.
     Our IT systems allow us to monitor sales trends, real-time product availability, order status throughout the full order cycle, and automates order transactions and invoicing transactions for our customers and vendors. The main focus of our IT systems is to allow us to transact and communicate with our customers and vendors in the most efficient manner possible. We provide various options to transact electronically with our customers and vendors through EDI, XML and other electronic methods.
     The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its IT systems to effectively manage and secure its infrastructure and customer data and to provide continued scalability and flexibility. In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present IT systems.
     Trademarks
     The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution, TechXtend and International Software Partners. The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.     Employees
