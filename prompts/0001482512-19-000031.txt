ITEM 1. Business 
Company Overview 
We are a vertically integrated real estate company focused on acquiring, repositioning, developing and operating high-quality office and state-of-the-art studio properties in high-growth, high-barrier-to-entry submarkets throughout Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. We invest across the risk-return spectrum, favoring opportunities where we can employ leasing, capital investment and management expertise to create additional value. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included office properties, comprising an aggregate of approximately 13.9 million square feet, and studio properties, comprising approximately 1.2 million square feet of sound-stage, office and supporting production facilities. We also own undeveloped density rights for approximately 2.6 million square feet of future office and residential space. 
We were formed as a Maryland corporation in 2009 to succeed to the business of Hudson Capital, LLC, a Los Angeles-based real estate investment firm founded by Victor J. Coleman, our Chief Executive Officer. On June 29, 2010, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”). We own our interests in all of our properties and conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, of which we serve as the sole general partner.
Business and Growth Strategies
We invest in Class-A office and studio properties located in high barrier-to-entry, innovation-centric submarkets with significant growth potential. Our positioning within these submarkets allows us to attract and retain quality, growth companies as tenants, many in the technology and media and entertainment sectors. The purchase of properties with a value-add component, typically through off-market transactions, also facilitates our growth. These types of assets afford us the opportunity to capture embedded rent growth and occupancy upside, and to strategically invest capital to reposition and redevelop assets to generate additional cash flow. We take a more measured approach to ground-up development, with most under-construction, planned or potential projects located on ancillary sites part of existing operating assets. Management expertise across disciplines supports execution at all levels of our operations. In particular, aggressive leasing and proactive asset management, combined with a focus on conservatively managing our balance sheet, are central to our strategy.  
Major Tenants 
As of December 31, 2018, our 15 largest tenants in our office portfolio represented approximately 37.2% of the total annualized base rent generated by our office properties. As of December 31, 2018, our two largest tenants were Google, Inc. and Netflix, Inc., which together accounted for 10.7% of the annualized base rent generated by our office properties.
For further detail regarding major tenants, see Item 2 “Properties—Tenant Diversification.” 
Our Competitive Position
We believe the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other real estate owners and operators and will enable us to capitalize on opportunities in the market to successfully expand and operate our portfolio.

•Experienced Management Team with a Proven Track Record of Acquiring and Operating Assets and Managing a Public Office REIT. Our senior management team has an average of over 25 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry, with a focus on acquiring, repositioning, developing and operating office properties in Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. 
•Committed and Incentivized Management Team. Our senior management team is dedicated to our successful operation and growth, with no competing real estate business interests outside of our Company. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, our senior management team owned approximately 2.9 million shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, thereby aligning management’s interests with those of our stockholders.
•Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest Focus with Local and Regional Expertise. We are primarily focused on acquiring and managing office properties in Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest, where our senior management has significant expertise and relationships. Our markets are supply-constrained as a result of the scarcity of available land, high construction costs and restrictive entitlement processes. We believe our experience, in-depth market knowledge and meaningful industry relationships with brokers, tenants, landlords, lenders and other market participants enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities, particularly those that arise in Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest.
•Long-Standing Relationships that Provide Access to an Extensive Pipeline of Investment and Leasing Opportunities. We have an extensive network of long-standing relationships with real estate developers, individual and institutional real estate owners, national and regional lenders, brokers, tenants and other participants in the Northern and Southern California and Pacific Northwest real estate markets. These relationships have historically provided us with access to attractive acquisition opportunities, including opportunities with limited or no prior marketing by sellers. We believe they will continue to provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive acquisition opportunities and additional growth capital, both of which may not be available to our competitors. Additionally, we focus on establishing strong relationships with our tenants in order to understand their long-term business needs, which we believe enhances our ability to retain quality tenants, facilitates our leasing efforts and maximizes cash flows from our properties.
•Growth-Oriented, Flexible and Conservative Capital Structure. We have remained well-capitalized since our IPO, including through 14 offerings (including two public offerings of 8.375% series B Cumulative Preferred Stock, ten public offerings of our common stock, one private placement of our common stock and one public offering of senior notes) and continuous offerings under our at-the-market (“ATM”) program for aggregate total proceeds of approximately $3.81 billion (before underwriters’ discounts and transaction costs) as of December 31, 2018. Available cash on hand and our unsecured credit facility provide us with a significant amount of capital to pursue acquisitions and execute our growth strategy, while maintaining a flexible and conservative capital structure. We believe our access to capital and flexible and conservative capital structure provide us with an advantage over many of our private and public competitors as we look to take advantage of growth opportunities. As of December 31, 2018, we had total borrowing capacity of approximately $600.0 million under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $400.0 million of which had been drawn. Additionally, we have the ability to draw up to $257.0 million under our construction loan, $5.0 million of which has been drawn. We believe our access to capital and flexible and conservative capital structure provide us with an advantage over many of our private and public competitors as we look to take advantage of growth opportunities. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $29.06 on December 31, 2018, we had a debt-to-market capitalization ratio (counting series A preferred units in our operating partnership, or series A preferred units, as debt) of approximately 36.8%. 
We have access to and are actively pursuing a pipeline of potential acquisitions consistent with our investment strategy. We believe our significant expertise in operating in the Northern and Southern California and Pacific Northwest office sectors and extensive, long-term relationships with real estate owners, developers and lenders, coupled with our conservative capital structure and access to capital, will allow us to capitalize on current market opportunities. 
Competition
We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office and commercial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located and some of which have greater financial resources than we do. In operating and managing our portfolio, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which our properties are operated, maintained and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-let space in light of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space. In that case, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.
We also face competition when pursuing acquisition and disposition opportunities. Our competitors may be able to pay higher property acquisition prices, may have private access to acquisition opportunities not available to us and may otherwise be in a better position to acquire a property. Competition may also increase the price required to consummate an acquisition opportunity and generally reduce the demand for commercial office space in our markets. Likewise, competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers may result in us receiving lower proceeds from a sale or in us not being able to dispose of a property at a time of our choosing due to the lack of an acceptable return.
 For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Segment and Geographic Financial Information
We report our results of operations through two segments: (i) office properties and (ii) studio properties. For information about our segments, refer to Part IV, Item 15(a) “Financial Statement and Schedules—Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”
All of our business is conducted in Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. For further detail regarding our geographic financial information, refer to Item 2 “Properties.” 
Employees 

At December 31, 2018, we had 311 employees. At December 31, 2018, four of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Each of these employees are on-site at the Sunset Bronson Studios property. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Principal Executive Offices
Our principal executive offices are located at 11601 Wilshire Blvd., Ninth Floor, Los Angeles, California 90025 and our telephone number is (310) 445-5700. We believe that our current facilities are adequate for our present operations. 
Regulation
General
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of the properties in our portfolio have the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We have developed and undertaken continuous capital improvement programs at certain properties in the past. These capital improvement programs will continue to progress and certain ADA upgrades will continue to be integrated into the planned improvements, specifically at the studio properties where we are able to utilize in-house construction crews to minimize costs for required ADA-related improvements. However, some of our properties may currently be in noncompliance with the ADA. Such noncompliance could result in the incurrence of additional costs to attain compliance, the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. 
Some of our properties contain, have contained, or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Similarly, some of our
 properties were used in the past for commercial or industrial purposes, or are currently used for commercial purposes, that involve or involved the use of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances, or are adjacent to or near properties that have been or are used for similar commercial or industrial purposes. As a result, some of our properties have been or may be impacted by contamination arising from the release of such hazardous substances or petroleum products. Where we have deemed appropriate, we have taken steps to address identified contamination or mitigate risks associated with such contamination; however, we are unable to ensure that further actions will not be necessary. As a result of the foregoing, we could potentially incur material liabilities. 
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I Environmental Site Assessments at all of the properties in our portfolio using the American Society for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”) Practice E 1527-05. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a report prepared for real estate holdings that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or asbestos or lead surveys. None of the recent site assessments identified any known past or present contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or operations. However, the assessments are limited in scope and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our properties may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. 
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing building materials (“ACBM”) or lead-based paint (“LBP”) and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing ACBM and LBP (and employers in such buildings) properly manage and maintain the asbestos and lead, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with asbestos or lead, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if asbestos or lead would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. Some of our properties contain ACBM and/or LBP and we could be liable for such damages, fines or penalties. 
In addition, the properties in our portfolio also are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements. Moreover, some of our tenants routinely handle and use hazardous or regulated substances and waste as part of their operations at our properties, which are subject to regulation. Such environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability resulting from these activities. Environmental liabilities could affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. In addition, changes in laws could increase the potential liability for noncompliance. We sometimes require our tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities. But in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. In addition, we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or waste and irrespective of tenant lease provisions. The costs associated with such liability could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us. 
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.
Corporate Responsibility
Our mission is to drive real estate performance and reduce risk through environmentally and socially responsible business practices grounded in sound corporate governance. 
Environmental
We are committed to high-performance sustainable operations. In keeping with our continuous process improvement approach, we conducted a Sustainability Assessment in 2017, and, based on the results, implemented a Sustainability Strategic Plan in 2018. The primary focus of our plan is to ensure the appropriate evolution of sustainability execution, with a focus on driving positive financial and environmental outcomes for shareholders, tenants, employees and the communities in which we invest. 
We aim to develop, redevelop and operate energy, waste and water-efficient properties. This includes the adoption of effective recycling, green-cleaning best practices, as well as the proactive implementation of sustainable property management strategies and efficiency retrofits. We increase the visibility and transparency of these efforts through third party validation. All our office properties are benchmarked in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, with 50% of the portfolio achieving an ENERGY STAR certification. Additionally, all developments are, or are on track to become, Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (“LEED”) certified.
We have established other long-term targets to more effectively measure, validate and improve key aspects of our environmental performance, which include: reducing energy and water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10% cumulatively by 2025 (compared to a 2016 baseline); and improving waste diversion rates and average ENERGY STAR score for the portfolio by at least 10% cumulatively by 2025 (compared to a 2016 baseline).
Social 
We are committed to corporate social responsibility as part of our culture and value proposition to stakeholders. We have a robust community-giving program, and we exercise a multi-pronged approach to ensure the highest standards for the health, safety and prosperity of our employees, tenants, service providers and partners. 
We seek to hire, retain and empower the best talent to realize their full potential and deliver outstanding results. Passionate about innovation and collaboration at all levels, we create workplaces that foster personal and professional growth. Our employees enjoy excellent subsidized health and wellness benefits, professional training and development workshops, on-site meals, ergonomic office equipment, and generous policies to encourage work/life balance.
Our philanthropy and volunteerism program, Hudson Helps, leverages our resources, people and expertise to provide meaningful, and often transformational, support to the communities in which we operate. At the corporate level, we partner with leading non-profit organizations, primarily in the areas of housing and shelter, education, employment and the environment. On an individual level, Hudson Helps includes initiatives that support the philanthropic and volunteer organizations that are meaningful to our employees. These include Company-matched donations and paid time off for volunteering.
Governance
We view sound corporate governance in accordance with all applicable, laws, rules, regulations and policies as essential to creating and preserving shareholder value. We have an effective, independent-minded, highly skilled and diverse board of directors. Three standing committees of our board of directors provide high-level guidance on matters affecting our business. The directors of our board and executives conduct themselves in accordance with the highest moral and ethical standards, informed by a robust Code of Conduct that reflects our values, and promotes honesty, transparency, integrity and accountability. 
Our corporate governance structure closely aligns with and protects shareholder interests. 90% of our directors are independent and all are elected for a one-year term, maximizing their accountability to our shareholders. Additionally, our bylaws ensure that directors in uncontested elections must receive a majority of votes to be elected. We also prohibit directors or executives from pledging or hedging securities, and we have strict stock ownership guidelines, inclusive of share ownership thresholds, for both directors of our board and named executive officers.
