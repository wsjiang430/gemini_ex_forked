Item 1. Business
Overview
Workiva is a leading provider of cloud-based solutions for connected data, reporting and compliance. Our platform, Wdesk, is used by thousands of public and private companies,  government agencies and higher-education institutions. Wdesk offers controlled collaboration, data linking, data integrations, granular permissions, process management and a full audit trail. Wdesk users are able to combine narrative with their data, which greatly improves insight in their financial, regulatory and management reporting processes. As of December 31, 2018, 3,340 organizations, including more than 75% of Fortune 500® companies, subscribed to our Wdesk platform. 
Our customers can connect Wdesk with data in more than 100 cloud and on-premise applications. In June 2018, we expanded our Wdesk platform with Wdata, which combines new data preparation capabilities with existing connectors and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to help our customers more easily capture, enrich and connect large datasets to Wdesk. Integrating enterprise business systems with our platform removes manual steps in the reporting and analysis process after the data leaves our customers' Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and other data systems and enables data assurance throughout the entire reporting process with an immutable audit trail. Wdata also enables a broader set of business users to explore complex data at scale and better manage data transformations in the office of the CFO. 
Many organizations throughout the world are required to report business data to a variety of regulators, boards and other stakeholders. However, these organizations often struggle to produce accurate and consistent information and reports because their ever-expanding volume of business data is typically stored in incompatible formats and spread across hundreds of different sources and locations. The stakes for enterprises are high: reporting incorrect, incomplete or untimely information increases the risks of poor decision-making, legal liability, reputational damage and a weakened competitive position.
By addressing these challenges, Workiva is changing the way people manage and report business data. Wdesk enables our users to collect, aggregate and prepare their unstructured and structured data in an integrated, secure, cloud-based environment. Numbers, narrative, charts and graphics can be linked inside Wdesk, which becomes an organization’s central repository for critical data, providing a single source of truth. With linked data and a full audit trail, users can trust that Wdesk spreadsheets, word documents, presentations, dashboards and reports are up-to-date and consistent, reducing the risk of reporting incorrect data or taking action based on erroneous information. 
With Wdesk serving as a consolidated record of business data, our customers can eliminate many repetitive, manual and time-consuming tasks imposed by legacy software, giving them more time to perform value-added work. Technology features familiar to people as consumers – speed, access and sharing – are available at work with Wdesk, thereby enabling our users to become more efficient and flexible, which we believe leads to greater job satisfaction, employee retention and career opportunities. 
Coworkers using Wdesk can create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater control, consistency, accuracy and productivity than ever before. Wdesk enables people to collaborate in the same document at the same time, which improves efficiency and version control. Wdesk is flexible and scalable, so users can easily adapt it to define, automate and change their business processes in real time, which helps our users streamline and modernize legacy processes and methods. 
With data linking in Wdesk, changes are automatically updated in all linked instances – including numbers, text, charts and graphics – throughout a customer’s spreadsheets, word-processing documents, 
 presentation decks and dashboards in our platform. Linking enables data consistency and ensures that collaborators are working with the most current data, which reduces operational costs related to tedious ticking and tying and gives our customers peace of mind that their data and reports are accurate and up-to-date.
Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
With permission controls in Wdesk, administrators can manage access at all levels for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Wdesk Technology
Our technology is enterprise-grade and developed to perform at scale, allowing users to work anytime from anywhere with an internet connection. Wdesk utilizes Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, which enable us to scale our compute and storage capacity on demand. We can deploy incremental changes to our customers on a daily basis by employing a continuous delivery process supported by Agile software development methodologies. As a result, all of our customers access the latest version of our platform, and upgrades are applied with minimal disruption to ongoing operations. In addition, in order to keep our customers’ data secure, we have developed advanced data security protocols that augment the standard security of the Amazon and Google cloud services. Our architecture has scalability for global enterprises, as well as advantages in reliability and cloud delivery.
Platform Milestones
In March 2010, we released our first software solution, which focused on streamlining reporting to the SEC. 
In March 2013, we launched our Wdesk platform to respond to the growing demand from our customers to use Wdesk for work beyond SEC reporting. 
In September 2016, we released enhancements to Wdesk that included: new capabilities to our spreadsheet application, making it one of the largest and fastest spreadsheet applications in the cloud; more powerful, dynamic dashboards; advanced testing and workflow capabilities; and expanded data relationships for SOX and internal control teams.
In July 2017, we began offering our customers the ability to connect Wdesk with more than 100 cloud and on-premise applications. Integrating enterprise business systems with Wdesk enables customers to directly connect the datasets they need into a central hub of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features. 
In June 2018, we expanded our Wdesk platform with Wdata, which combines new data preparation capabilities with existing connectors and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable customers to more easily capture, enrich and connect large datasets to Wdesk. Wdata enables a broader set of business users to explore complex data at scale and better manage data transformations in the office of the CFO. 
Markets and Use Cases
Although Workiva solutions are used for hundreds of different use cases, we currently focus our sales and marketing resources in five areas: (1) Finance and Accounting, (2) Risk and Controls, (3)
 Regulatory Reporting, (4) Financial Close, Management and Performance Reporting and (5) Statutory and Corporate Tax Reporting.
We distribute our software and services through field sales, inside sales and partnership channels. We focus on a “land-and-expand” strategy to acquire new customers and expand our existing customer relationships. 
Our customer success and professional services teams help our account managers build our existing customer relationships by providing advice on best practices that enable users to harness the full power of Wdesk. 
Many of the largest and most demanding enterprises in the world are included in our broadly diversified customer base. Our largest customer represented less than 1% of our revenue in 2018. We believe that we have exceptional customer satisfaction, as evidenced by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 96.1% (excluding add-on seats) as of December 2018. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-ons was 107.1% as of December 2018.
We have experienced strong revenue growth since we released our first solution in March 2010. Our revenue increased from $178.6 million in 2016 to $244.3 million in 2018, representing a 17% compound annual growth rate. We incurred a net loss of $44.0 million in 2016, $44.4 million in 2017 and $50.1 million in 2018. Approximately 82% of our revenue in 2018 was derived from subscription and support fees, with the remainder from professional services.
Our Industry
Industry Trends are Driving a Fundamental Shift in How Enterprises Collect, Manage, Report and Analyze Critical Business Data.
Data is Widespread and Disconnected. Enterprise data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in incompatible formats. Organizations often struggle with creating efficient and trusted solutions to harness this data in ways that can support decision-making.
Regulatory Requirements are Continually Changing. Legislation, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States, and requirements in Europe for reporting with a Single Electronic Format (ESEF) taxonomy, continue to drive complex reporting mandates. For example, SOX requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. 
Charged with implementing these legislative mandates and others, governmental agencies such as the SEC, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Banking Authority and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority continue to issue and change regulations that affect existing reporting requirements. Regulators are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. For example, in recent years insurance companies have been required to produce reports for Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA) and Model Audit Rule, often referred to as MAR-SOX because of its similarity to SOX compliance. The European Banking Authority’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) requires institutions to report on their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The Financial Conduct Authority, which
 regulates financial services firms and financial markets in the UK, requires reporting under the Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS) rules for registered firms who hold or control client money or custody assets.
Use of Machine-Readable Data Is Growing. Regulators are demanding greater use of structured, machine-readable data in companies’ reports. For example, the SEC requires that public companies include “structured financial data” in filed annual and quarterly reports so that an investor can automate extraction of the data the instant it is filed and compare it to performance in past years, information from other companies and industry averages. The SEC implemented its structured data mandate by requiring companies to tag the data in their financial statements using XBRL, which is a royalty-free, international standard designed specifically for digital reporting of financial, performance, risk and compliance information. XBRL provides a unique, machine-readable tag for individual disclosures within business reports. Use of XBRL enables government agencies to automate screening and analysis of filed documents. For example, the SEC Division of Enforcement has integrated the analysis of XBRL data into its investigative processes. 
We expect the use of non-proprietary data standards, such as XBRL, to continue to grow. The U.S. federal government is beginning to mandate the use of open data standards for a variety of regulatory reports. The SEC is phasing in a requirement for reporting companies to begin using Inline XBRL, a standard that embeds XBRL in financial statements, thus eliminating the need to file two documents. Outside the United States, securities regulators, stock exchanges and taxing authorities in several countries (including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom) already require the filing of XBRL data. The SEC now requires Foreign Private Issuers (FPI) that prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to include XBRL tagging in their SEC filings. In addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) now mandates Inline XBRL for its European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) taxonomy. More than 5,000 EU issuers will be required to use this taxonomy for their annual financial reports, ending on or after January 1, 2020. 
Management Oversight is Increasing. Enterprises are under increasing pressure to report a growing amount of information to internal management teams, boards of directors, internal and external auditors and other stakeholders. We believe that data needs to be collected, reported and analyzed more rapidly than ever before. Management teams are increasingly focused on leveraging data to support critical decisions. At the same time, boards of directors are pressing organizations to improve transparency in order to better fulfill their fiduciary duties.
Workforces are Becoming More Geographically Dispersed. Market dynamics and the globalization of enterprises have changed where people work and how they work together. Organizations are becoming increasingly global, with employees geographically distributed to support strategic and business needs. Workforce flexibility initiatives have resulted in more employees working remotely, increasing the demand for cloud-based enterprise software that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. 
Consumerization of Workplace Technology. Technical advancements in laptop computers, smart phones, tablets and wireless networks have enabled mobility across the enterprise. The rapid advancement of consumer applications, particularly social media, has raised expectations for enterprise technology as employees expect their workplace technology to achieve the same level of functionality, performance, data integration and ease of use as the consumer technologies that permeate their daily lives.
Legacy Business Processes and Solutions Are Insufficient for Meeting the Requirements of Modern Enterprises.
For many enterprises, the process of compiling, reporting and analyzing critical data has been manual, repetitive and error-prone. Large enterprises often employ hundreds or even thousands of people to manually collect data with unencrypted emails and create and update rolling versions of draft documents and disconnected spreadsheets. Modern enterprises require a level of collaboration, security and control that we believe outdated business software and point solutions do not deliver. Shortcomings of legacy business processes and solutions include the following: 
Access to resources is restricted. Traditional solutions require employees to be physically present at, or remotely logged into, a machine with the required technology and access permissions. 
Collaboration is inefficient and risky. Traditional office software requires one person to work on one version of a presentation or report at one time. This rigidity creates challenges as concurrent versions lead to a tedious and time-consuming reconciliation process. 
Workflows are rigid and serial. Workflows for presentation and report production operate as a series of dependent events, with workers being unable to advance sections they are responsible for while waiting for their turn in the document-production process. 
Dataset creation is highly manual. Traditional dataset creation relies on ad-hoc processes and loosely defined protocols to consolidate a patchwork of disparate data sources with different owners and storage locations across the enterprise. 
Edits are error-prone and lack audit trails. Traditional software does not permit linking references to a single source, so when a change is made it does not flow throughout the document or related documents, increasing the risk of errors. 
Changes are difficult to audit. Traditional solutions do not offer visibility into data provenance or the lineage of changes to a document. 
Control is limited. With legacy software, multiple versions of a spreadsheet, presentation or report may be stored in numerous locations across an enterprise, making it difficult to control who can review and edit, and even more difficult to adjust these roles as the creation process evolves. 
Wdesk Platform Benefits
Public and private companies across a wide range of industries, as well as government agencies and higher-education institutions, use Wdesk to help coworkers simultaneously create, review and publish data-linked documents and reports with greater speed, control and accuracy. Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. A complete record of data provenance and all changes helps our customers save time, mitigate risk, gain insights and make better, data-driven decisions.
Benefits to Decision-Makers
Reduces Risk. Numbers, narrative, charts and graphics can be linked inside Wdesk, which becomes an organization’s central repository for business data or single source of truth. Managers can trust that Wdesk spreadsheets, word documents, presentations, dashboards and reports are up-to-date and consistent, reducing the risk of reporting incorrect data or taking action based on erroneous information. In addition, Wdesk ensures that presentations and reports are published using the most recent business rules, formats and XBRL and Inline XBRL protocols where applicable. 
Improves Data Transparency. Wdesk provides accountability and transparency through a detailed audit trail that tracks every change made by every user over time. Decision-makers benefit from the ability to drill down into each discrete data point, which increases data transparency, accountability and trust that critical business data across an organization is verified and accurate. 
Saves Time. With linked data in a single version – along with embedded tasks, comments and supporting documentation – Wdesk helps our customers reduce or completely eliminate repetitive, manual tasks, giving teams more time for analysis and other value-added work.
Streamlines Reviews. With Wdesk permission controls, administrators can grant access to their external auditors, outside counsel, and other consultants, which streamlines the review process and reduces expenses.
Better-Informed Decision-Making. People who use Wdesk know that they are working on the most current and accurate version, which helps our customers make quicker and better-informed decisions.
Benefits to Users
Ubiquitous Access. Users can access our Wdesk platform through a secure, web-based interface any time and anywhere an internet connection is available. By providing flexible access to Wdesk, users can be productive from wherever and whenever they choose to work. 
Faster Time to Value. The Wdesk interface is familiar and intuitive so it can be easily deployed in days or weeks, enabling new users to make quick improvements to business data processes. 
Better Collaboration. Our platform enables collaborators to draft and edit original work, assign and respond to tasks, make and resolve comments, track progress and certify sign-offs within the same document, spreadsheet, presentation or report at the same time from any location with internet access. 
Higher Job Satisfaction. Wdesk helps users reduce or completely eliminate repetitive, manual and time-consuming functions, thereby becoming more efficient and flexible, which we believe leads to greater job satisfaction, employee retention, cross-role training and career opportunities. 
Transferable Job Skills. The ability to work in Wdesk is increasingly being recognized as a transferable skill set desired by accounting, finance, compliance and operations teams. Wdesk proficiency often appears in our users’ resumes and becomes an attractive consideration in promotions within an organization or by recruiters looking for professionals with advanced skills.
Growth Strategy
We continue to add new Wdesk customers as well as add seats at existing customers for a wide range of use cases at public and private companies, as well as government agencies and higher-education institutions. In addition, customer demand for our platform continues to expand as we improve Wdesk features and capabilities and build our ecosystem of customers and partners. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
Generate Growth From Existing Customers. Wdesk can exhibit a powerful network effect within an organization that attracts additional users and more data. As more employees in an enterprise use Wdesk, additional opportunities for collaboration and automation drive demand among their colleagues. Expansion within current customers includes adding users for both existing solutions and new use cases. Our new solution-based licensing model, which offers Wdesk subscriptions by solution rather than by our previous seat-based model, makes it easier for customers to add colleagues to Wdesk and delivers more value to our customers.
Pursue New Customers. Our first software solution enabled customers to streamline and automate their SEC regulatory filings. In 2013, we began expanding into additional markets that were faced with managing large, complex processes with many contributors and disparate sets of business data. We now sell to new customers in the areas of: finance and accounting; risk and controls; regulatory reporting; financial close, management and performance reporting; and statutory and corporate tax reporting. We intend to continue to build our sales and marketing organization and leverage our brand equity to attract new customers in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. 
Expand our Partnership Ecosystem. We continue to expand our ecosystem of partners, including Business Process Outsourcing and managed service firms, global consultancies providing an array of accounting and advisory services, systems integrators, large and mid-sized Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and IT service providers. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Growth in Non-SEC Use Cases. We believe we have opportunities in several large and growing markets outside of SEC reporting, and therefore, we are continuing to invest in software development, sales and marketing to help Workiva grow in the U.S. and in international markets. For example, we continue to sell Wdesk for regulated risk, SOX and internal controls, audit management, capital markets transactions, performance and management reporting, statutory reporting and corporate tax reporting. 
Offer Solutions for Large Financial Transformations. In 2018, we began helping companies use Wdesk to support large financial transformations, which drives wider adoption of our platform. We improved our user management functionality and released Wdesk Workspaces to give our customers a trusted environment for teams and to enable our solution-based licensing model. These new Wdesk capabilities enable even larger teams to benefit from Wdesk's core strengths: collaboration, control, accountability, and data assurance.
Offer More Solutions. We intend to introduce new solutions to continue to meet growing demand for our Wdesk platform. Our close and trusted relationships with our customers are often sources for new use cases, features and solutions. We have a disciplined process for tracking, developing and releasing new solutions that are designed to have immediate, broad applicability; a strong value proposition and a high return on investment for both Workiva and our customers. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs, conducts industry-based research and defines new markets. This vetting process involves our sales, product marketing, customer success, professional services, research and development, finance and senior management teams. 
For example, in September 2018, we released a new solution for internal auditors to help them gain insight into risk management across their organizations. We also released a new solution in 2018 for corporate tax reporting that helps teams easily and accurately manage data for tax provision, transfer pricing, and financial reporting. 
Close the Reporting Gap. Many organizations struggle to produce accurate and consistent data and reports because their business data is typically spread across hundreds of different sources and stored in ERP systems or other incompatible formats. When enterprises need to report their data, they often resort to exporting that data to legacy, disconnected spreadsheets that lack the control, auditability and transparency that is required for accurate reporting to board, regulators and other stakeholders. Wdesk closes this data gap in the reporting process. 
Expand Internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 91% of our revenue in the United States. However, the growth drivers for our solution are similar in other parts
 of the world, including the need to manage complex datasets, reduce errors and risk, improve efficiency and respond to regulatory requirements. In addition to the U.S., we market our platform and solutions to organizations in Canada, EMEA, and parts of Asia. In 2019, we plan to continue to increase our sales and marketing presence in EMEA to target the following use cases: 
•XBRL Tagging for Foreign Private Issuers. The SEC requires Foreign Private Issuers (FPI) that prepare their financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to include XBRL tagging in their SEC filings for fiscal periods ending on or after December 15, 2017. 
•Inline XBRL for ESEF Taxonomy. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) now mandates Inline XBRL for its European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) taxonomy. More than 5,000 EU issuers will be required to use this taxonomy for their annual financial reports, ending on or after January 1, 2020. 
•Global Statutory Reporting. As in the U.S., we also see growing demand for Wdesk in Europe for statutory reporting, which is a complex and painful process for our multinational customers that are required to report tax information throughout different countries and local jurisdictions where they do business. 
•European Companies that Report to U.S. Regulators. There are a variety of reports required by European companies that do business in the U.S., including Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Stress Testing, SEC filings and SOX and internal controls compliance.
•European Banking Authority Requirements. The European Banking Authority’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) requires institutions to report on their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). 
•CASS Reporting. The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services firms and financial markets in the UK, requires reporting under the Client Asset Sourcebook (CASS) rules for registered firms who hold or control client money or custody assets.
Expand into Federal Government Agencies. In July of 2018, we received the Authorization to Operate (ATO) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which demonstrates our commitment to improving processes and ensuring the security of our customers' data. With this new authorization, federal government agencies can more easily adopt Wdesk to help streamline a wide range of data analyses and reporting. In addition, many commercial enterprises, particularly those in regulated industries, consider FedRAMP the highest standard of security assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud software.
Integrate More Data. Wdata, which includes data preparation tools along with data connectors and APIs, allows our customers to create direct connections to their data and bring much larger amounts of data into Wdesk. Direct integration removes manual steps in the reporting and analysis process after the data leaves our customers' ERP and other data systems, and it enables data assurance throughout the entire reporting process with an immutable audit trail.
Continue to Innovate. We believe we are the first technology company to build an integrated, cloud-based platform that provides a secure ecosystem to manage structured and unstructured business data that spans data integrations, data collection and linking, controlled collaboration, process management, granular permissions, streamlined reporting and data-driven decision-making. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions and use cases. 
Wdesk Platform Use Cases
Our Wdesk platform enables customers to collect, link, manage, report and analyze business data for a wide range of use cases across public and private companies, government agencies and higher-education institutions. In addition, customer demand for a broader-based Wdesk platform continues to expand as we improve Wdesk features and capabilities and grow our ecosystem of partners. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk, which becomes a central repository of trusted data, with powerful linking, auditability and control features.
Although Workiva solutions are used for hundreds of different use cases, we currently focus our sales and marketing resources in five areas: (1) Finance and Accounting, (2) Risk and Controls, (3) Regulatory Reporting, (4) Financial Close, Management and Performance Reporting and (5) Statutory and Corporate Tax Reporting.
Finance and Accounting
In the finance and accounting market, we sell Wdesk to public and private companies, government agencies and higher-education institutions that use our platform to improve business data processes and create a wide range of documents, spreadsheets, presentations and reports for management, investors, boards, regulators, auditors and other stakeholders. 
SEC and SEDAR Reporting. We developed Wdesk to give customers control over the entire SEC reporting process, from data collection to drafting to embedding supporting documentation to the actual filing with XBRL or Inline XBRL. Our SEC reporting solution allows our customers to prepare and file all major SEC reports, such as Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, as well as Form S-1 and other registration statements, proxy statements and Section 16 reports. Features tailored to the SEC reporting process include the capability to concurrently create reports in the HTML format required for filing on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) system and the ability to perform XBRL tagging as well as to submit SEC reports with Inline XBRL. Foreign Private Issuers in Europe can use Wdesk to include XBRL tagging in their 20-F and 40-F filings with the SEC. Wdesk also enables customers to create earnings press releases, earnings call scripts, presentations and other investor relations materials with data linked to the corresponding filing. Canadian issuers can use Wdesk to draft and file reports on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR).
Non-SEC Use Cases by Accounting and Finance Teams. Public and private companies, government agencies and higher-education institutions must create a vast array of complex financial and managerial reports. Wdesk use cases include: Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A), board reporting, annual and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, monthly operation and flash reports, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) and budgeting for state and local governments, financial reporting and planning for universities, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), investment company compliance and capital markets transactions. 
Risk and Controls
We sell Wdesk to teams that work in Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance, internal audit management, enterprise risk management and policy and procedure management.
SOX Compliance. Our customers use Wdesk to increase efficiency in documenting, implementing and assessing internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) as required by SOX. SOX also requires public company CEOs and CFOs to individually certify that their annual and quarterly financial reports
 are accurate and complete and to assess the effectiveness of their ICFR. Increased scrutiny from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) on audits of management’s assessment of internal controls – and the transition in the framework used for assessing internal controls – is driving public companies to find more efficient and accurate solutions for SOX compliance. With Wdesk, our customers can collect data from multiple departments, centralize that information in a linked platform, create and track process narratives and flows with co-workers, embed evidence and directly test controls. We began selling our Wdesk solution to the SOX market in the second quarter of 2014. 
Internal Audit Management. We sell to the broad-based audit market because users in that market often collaborate with colleagues working in SOX, risk and controls across an organization. Internal audit management extends throughout an organization, drawing in Wdesk users from a wide range of departments. Internal audit management includes audit risk assessments, the audit planning process, workpaper management, testing, issues management and audit reports that encompass the audit committee report and the internal audit group. Wdesk allows simultaneous collaboration with control and accountability and enables robust documentation, accurate audit conclusions and complete audit trails, which are essential to auditors, executives and boards. With permission controls, administrators can restrict access at all levels for each user to create, review and edit data and documents that relate directly to them. This control feature also enables users to grant access to their external auditors, which further streamlines the review process and reduces expenses. 
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). With Wdesk, risk management practices can be integrated throughout the organization while maintaining information privacy, audit trails and security resulting in highly efficient and transparent compliance. Therefore, we also sell Wdesk for Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) as a solution for enterprises to identify systemic risks, determine risk probabilities, assess risk magnitude, plan strategic responses and report to boards and other stakeholders. Wdesk also can help business leaders make real-time ERM decisions.
Policy and Procedure Management. Our customers can use Wdesk to establish a connected, enterprise-wide policy and procedure management process. Teams can access and manage all content for policies, standards, procedures and guidelines for the entire enterprise in Wdesk, and they can efficiently manage ongoing policy review cycles throughout the year. Customers can map policies directly to risks, controls, processes and regulations and create a consistent template-driven format or taxonomy for all policies. Customers can also distribute and track employee attestation of policies and procedures with automated certification reminders and progress dashboards. 
Regulatory Reporting
Changing regulations and mandates create complexity in regulatory and compliance reporting, which is often carried out by teams scattered across different departments and geographies within organizations. While we cannot predict future changes that could affect federal regulations, we expect demand for Wdesk to remain strong as a platform for improving transparency, accountability and insight into business and government data.
We market Wdesk and Wdata to address regulatory compliance risk and enterprise risk. Examples of regulations facing our customers include the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III, Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Wdesk use cases include Resolution and Recovery Plans (RRP), Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), and Dodd-Frank Stress Testing (DFAST). Regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are also implementing new, industry-specific reporting requirements. 
Financial Close, Management and Performance Reporting
Operations teams across organizations of all sizes typically have to collect, track, manage and report on a wide range of operating metrics to drive better business outcomes. Our customers continuously find new use cases across their organizations, including board committee and quarterly reporting, C-Suite reporting, strategic business plans, financial statements, variance reports, monthly management reports, managing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), data collection for domestic sales, performance reporting and employee benefit financial statements.
Statutory and Corporate Tax Reporting
In 2018, Workiva released a solution for corporate tax reporting that helps teams easily and accurately manage data for tax provisions, transfer pricing and financial reporting. Users can import data from ERP and financial consolidation systems, leveraging existing trial balance, financial statements and other back-office reports, and manage all of their information in a single, integrated platform of connected workpapers and reports. Users can share the same data across legal, tax and accounting departments without having to leave Wdesk. This allows tax teams to go paperless and attach outside workpapers, such as fixed asset reports, directly to the figures that they support.
Statutory Reporting. We also see growing demand for Wdesk in the U.S. and in Europe for statutory reporting, which is a complex and painful process for our multinational customers that are required to report tax information throughout different countries and local jurisdictions where they do business. Currently, most of these enterprises rely on hundreds of legacy word-processing documents and spreadsheets, circulating in emails with no digital audit trail. This disconnected, antiquated process is prone to errors and creates inconsistent reports to different entities within the same local jurisdiction. Without a standardized process, companies face enormous risk and high expenses related to outsourcing to a bevy of local consultants and accounting firms, which weakens control and extends review time. 
Wdesk Platform Technology
Wdesk is the cloud-based, multi-tenant technology platform upon which all Workiva software solutions run. Wdesk is built on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform and is composed of proprietary and open-source technologies. Users can access all Wdesk solutions with any standard web browser and iPad and Android applications. We believe that the following characteristics comprise our platform’s key competitive advantages:
Easy to Deploy and Configure. The Wdesk platform can be deployed within days or weeks for new customers and can be easily configured by the customer for individual employees or entire teams.
 Because our solutions are browser-based, customers avoid costly, time-intensive deployments typically associated with on-premise enterprise software.
High Performance. The architecture, design, deployment and management of our solutions are focused on enterprise-grade scalability, availability and security. The performance of the Wdesk platform has been tested and proven by some of the largest, most demanding enterprises in the world. 
Always Improving. Additionally, constant customer collaboration and development iteration allows us to offer our customers continuous improvements by releasing a new version of Wdesk several times each week. 
Scales Rapidly. Wdesk is designed to support millions of end users as a result of its scalability and our relationship with the Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services. A number of our customers have reported millions of links to single sources of data, among multiple documents, spreadsheets and presentations, without any noticeable negative effects on performance. 
Secure. Many of the largest enterprises in the world trust us with their most sensitive data. Wdesk employs stringent data security, reliability, integrity and privacy practices. In addition to our regular customer security assessments, we employ best practice web technologies, including continuous and ongoing penetration and vulnerability testing (manual and automatic, internal and third-party). The quality of our data security efforts is validated by our annual completion of an independent audit process.
Research and Development
Our research and development team is distributed among nine office locations in North America and Europe, including our headquarters in Ames, Iowa. Our research and development efforts are focused on improving the Wdesk platform for broad use across all of our solutions. Our innovation is driven by listening to our customers and creating solutions to meet their needs. We employ Agile software development methods that place customers at the heart of the design process. This includes constant collaboration and iteration that delivers new software functionality at a very fast pace. 
Customers
Thousands of organizations, including global enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees trust Workiva. As of December 31, 2018, we had more than 3,300 customers, including more than 75% of Fortune 500 companies. Our Wdesk platform modernizes the way our customers work. Our customers are passionate, loyal supporters of our solutions, as demonstrated by our subscription and support revenue retention rate of 96.1% (excluding add-on seats) as of the December 2018 measurement date. Our subscription and support revenue retention rate including add-on seats was 107.1% as of the December 2018 measurement date.
Competition
The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our different solutions, as changes in regulation and market trends result in evolving customer requirements and demand for enterprise software. Our primary competitors include: 
•Status quo, manual business processes that rely on legacy business software tools;
•Diversified enterprise software providers;
•Niche software providers that provide point solutions;
•Providers of professional services, including consultants and business and financial printers;
•Governance, risk and compliance software providers; and
•Business intelligence / performance management software providers.
As our markets expand, we expect to compete with more highly specialized software vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively. 
The principal competitive factors in our market include: product features, reliability, performance and effectiveness; product line breadth, diversity and applicability; product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures; price and total cost of ownership; adherence to industry standards and certifications; strength of sales and marketing efforts; and brand awareness and reputation. We believe that our Wdesk cloud-based platform has the combination of features and value to our customers that will continue to allow us to compete favorably. 
Sales and Marketing
Our “land-and-expand” sales strategy focuses on acquiring new customers and growing our existing customer relationships. We believe that we have penetrated only a small fraction of our market opportunity, and we intend to continue investing in sales and marketing to drive growth in the U.S. Canada, Europe and parts of Asia. 
Sales
Our sales organization employs a combination of field sales, inside sales and partnership channels. We focus on a “land-and-expand” strategy to acquire new customers and expand our existing customer relationships. 
In 2018, we continued to expand our ecosystem of partners, including Business Process Outsourcing and managed service firms, global consultancies providing an array of accounting and advisory services, systems integrators, large and and mid-sized Independent Software Vendors (ISV) and IT service providers. Our advisory and service partners offer a wider range of domain and functional expertise that broadens the capabilities of Wdesk, bringing scale and support to customers and prospects. Our technology partners enable more data and process integrations to help customers connect critical transactional systems directly to Wdesk.
Our sales organization comprises sales development representatives, pre-sales engineers and account managers. Our sales development representatives qualify sales-accepted opportunities for our account managers. Our pre-sales engineers focus on solutions and custom product demonstrations and consultative sales. Our account managers work to attract new customers as well as expand Wdesk into new use cases and departments across our current customers’ organizations. 
Our customer success and professional services teams also help our account managers grow our existing customer relationships by providing advice and best practices that enable users to harness the full power of Wdesk.
We expect to continue to strengthen our sales coverage in our current markets, as well as expand our sales footprint in locations where we see a demand for our solutions. To achieve this growth, we plan to continue to hire motivated sales people with experience in large enterprise software sales and in specific geographical regions. We believe that our approach to hiring sales people, along with a progressive training, culture and compensation package will allow us to retain sales talent and continue to drive growth. 
Marketing 
Our marketing organization promotes our brand, generates demand for our offerings and researches and assesses product and market needs. Our advance planning team assesses customer needs,
 conducts industry-based research and identifies new markets. Our product marketing team develops the go-to-market strategy for Workiva solutions and manages pricing and licensing strategies. The product marketing team also supports our sales team with playbooks that include profiles of typical buyers, key messages, value propositions, competitive analysis and sales strategies. 
Our demand generation programs are categorized by solution and industry and are focused on engaging business leaders, process owners and technology teams. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target current and prospective customers. 
Professional Services and Customer Success
We believe our professional services and customer success teams are essential contributors to our long-term success and differentiate our service from our competitors. 
Professional Services. Professional Services include initial setup of documents; XBRL mapping, tagging and review; best practices implementation; and business process consulting. Our XBRL team is primarily composed of people with accounting or financial reporting experience who work with our customers to perform XBRL mapping, tagging and review services. We also employ a team of Solution Architects who offer consulting services to customers to improve and streamline their Wdesk-related business data processes. 
Customer Success. Our Customer Success Managers (CSMs) partner with our users to understand their business goals and objectives and offer in-depth knowledge and best practices for each customer’s Wdesk usage. In addition to our CSMs, our Customer Success Experts (CSEs) provide 24/7 live customer support via phone, digital messaging and web-based conferencing. We provide intensive training to both our CSMs and CSEs and segment them for each solution and market focus. In addition, we pay for employees to maintain professional certifications and licenses that are important to our customers, and we host regular company-wide employee education sessions on business, industry, technology and workplace topics.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. To safeguard these rights, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual protections in the United States and other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 36 issued patents and 20 patent applications pending in the United States relating to our platform. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow or otherwise limit our claims. Any patents issued may be contested, designed around, found unenforceable, or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade-secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
If we continue to be successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop solutions and services that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our platform infringes their proprietary rights.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the enterprise software industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, may assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us, and our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify our customers against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain solutions or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. In addition, to the extent that we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims from third parties. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents, copyrights or other proprietary rights. 
We have registered a number of trademarks and logos, including “Workiva” and “Wdesk,” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in several jurisdictions outside the United States. We have also registered other trademarks in the United States and in other jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and we cannot assure you that these names will be available for use in all such jurisdictions.
Litigation
From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of any currently pending legal proceedings to which we are a party will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,319 full-time employees. Our headcount as of December 31, 2018 was relatively flat from our headcount as of December 31, 2017. None of our employees is represented by a labor organization or is a party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
