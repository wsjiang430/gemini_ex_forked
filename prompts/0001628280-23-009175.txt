ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
OVERVIEW 
Williams-Sonoma, Inc., (the "Company”, "we", or "us") incorporated in 1973, is an omni-channel specialty retailer of high-quality products for the home. 
In 1956, our founder, Chuck Williams, turned a passion for cooking and eating with friends into a small business with a big idea. He opened a store in Sonoma, California to sell the French cookware that intrigued him while visiting Europe but that could not be found in America. Chuck’s business, which set a standard for customer service, took off and helped fuel a revolution in American cooking and entertaining that continues today. 
In the decades that followed, the quality of our products, our ability to identify new opportunities in the market and our people-first approach to business have facilitated our expansion beyond the kitchen into nearly every area of the home. Growth across our portfolio has been fueled by our three key differentiators - our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy, and our values. Our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization allow us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at competitive prices. Through our e-commerce platform, our in-house customer relationship management and data analytic teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections. We have expanded our in-store services to include ship-to-store as we transition our stores to not only provide an exceptional customer service experience but to also serve as design centers and omni-fulfillment hubs.
Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is the world’s largest digital-first, design-led and sustainable home retailer. Our products represent distinct merchandise strategies — Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham — are marketed through e-commerce websites, direct-mail catalogs and retail stores. These brands are also part of The Key Rewards, our loyalty and credit card program that offers members exclusive benefits across the Williams-Sonoma family of brands. We operate in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, offer international shipping to customers worldwide, and have unaffiliated franchisees that operate stores in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea and India, as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations. We are also proud to be a leader in our industry with our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) efforts.

Kids are, and have always been, the inspiration behind what we do at Pottery Barn Kids.

Most importantly, all our designs are rigorously tested to meet the highest child safety standards and expertly crafted from the best materials to last beyond their childhood years.

The digitally native brand is known for high quality collections, ranging from home gifts to luggage to handbags, designed in-house that can be personalized with more than 50 exclusive monograms.

In 2017, we acquired Outward, Inc., a 3-D imaging and augmented reality platform for the home furnishings and décor industry. Headquartered in San Jose, California, Outward’s technology enables scalable applications in product visualization, digital room design and augmented and virtual reality. 
OPERATIONS 
As of January 29, 2023, we had the following merchandise strategies: Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm, Williams Sonoma Home, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, which sell our products through our e-commerce websites, retail stores and direct-mail catalogs. We offer shipping from many of our brands to countries worldwide, while our catalogs reach customers throughout the U.S. The e-commerce and retail businesses complement each other by meeting the customers where they are; building brand awareness and acting as effective advertising vehicles. Our ability to leverage insights from both these channels, our omni-channel positioning and our marketing efforts, focused on digital advertising complemented by targeted catalogs, drive sales to each of our channels. Consistent with our published privacy policies, we leverage our proprietary customer file which is a unified view of customers across brands and channels, for digital, email, and catalog marketing purposes, augmented by our propensity to buy models developed by our in-house analytics team. Our retail stores serve as billboards for our brands, which we believe inspires new and existing customers to also shop online. We operate 530 stores, which include 489 stores in 41 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, 20 stores in Canada, 19 stores in Australia and 2 stores in the United Kingdom. We also have multi-year franchise agreements with third parties in the Middle East, the Philippines, Mexico, South Korea and India that currently operate 138 franchised locations as well as e-commerce websites in certain locations. 
SUPPLIERS 
We purchase most of our merchandise from numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, the largest of which accounted for approximately 3% of our purchases during fiscal 2022. Approximately 67% of our merchandise purchases in fiscal 2022 were sourced from foreign vendors, predominantly in Asia and Europe. Substantially all of these purchases were negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. In addition, we manufacture merchandise, primarily upholstered furniture and lighting, at our facilities located in North Carolina, California, Oregon and Mississippi. The current macroeconomic environment is uncertain and we continue to incur increased costs across our global supply chain. It is hard to predict with certainty when these supply chain challenges will be fully resolved, and we currently expect these supply chain challenges to negatively impact our cost of goods sold into 2023. Additionally, we are subject to risks that may disrupt our supply chain operations or regionalization efforts, such as increasing labor costs and union organizing activity. Despite these challenges, we believe our key differentiators, growth strategies and the efficiencies of our operating model to reduce costs and manage inventory levels leave us well-positioned to mitigate these costs in both the short- and long- term. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on the effect the global supply chain disruption has had on our results of operations.
COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY 
The specialty e-commerce and retail businesses are highly competitive. Our e-commerce websites, retail stores and direct-mail catalogs compete with other retailers, including e-commerce retailers, large department stores, discount retailers, other specialty retailers offering home-centered assortments and other direct-mail catalogs. The continued shift to e-commerce has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, including discount retailers selling undifferentiated products at reduced prices, new business models and increased competition from established companies. We compete on the basis of our brand authority, the quality of our merchandise, our customer service, our proprietary customer list, our e-commerce websites and marketing capabilities, the location and appearance of our stores, as well as our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy, and our values, which we believe have become increasingly relevant and set us apart from our competitors. Our in-house teams design our own products and work with our talented vendors to bring quality, sustainable products to market through our high-touch multi-channel platform.
Our business is subject to substantial seasonal variations in demand. Historically, a significant portion of our net revenues and net earnings have been realized during the period from October through January, and levels of net revenues and net earnings have typically been lower during the period from February through September. We believe this is the general pattern associated with the retail industry. In preparation for and during our holiday selling season, we hire a substantial number of additional temporary employees, primarily in our retail stores, distribution facilities and customer care centers.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
As of January 29, 2023, we had approximately 21,100 employees, who we refer to as associates, of whom approximately 12,500 were full-time. In preparation for and during our fiscal 2022 holiday selling season, we hired a substantial number of part-time and seasonal employees, primarily in our retail stores, distribution facilities and customer care centers. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 
We have three key ESG pillars as key areas of focus for our Company. One of those three pillars is “People” in keeping with our long-held “People First” culture. This includes the following areas of focus: 
Associate Engagement 
We conduct an annual Associate Opinion Survey to directly engage with and collect feedback from our associates, which we use to improve the experience of our teams. Our human resources department maintains an open-door policy for associates to report concerns, and we provide an anonymous reporting hotline, which is available in multiple languages and managed by an independent company not affiliated with us. We strive to deliver a workplace experience where the quality of our engagement with fellow associates, business partners and customers matches the quality of the products and services we bring to the marketplace. 
Talent Development and Engagement 
We invest in our employees through accessible resources and structured training programs that help our associates to create the career they envision for themselves. We offer a large selection of development opportunities for our employees including in-person and online learning, as well as professional development courses, such as goal setting, unconscious bias and inclusive leadership training. We have a company-wide Advisor Program, which matches associates in a manager-and-above role with an associate in a lower-level role to form advisor/advisee relationships to provide career guidance and receive support in working through career and development challenges. We created new learning programs to further build skills and career opportunities for associates, notably focused on design and core retail skills. We also foster other team-based programs to develop talent at all levels of the Company, supplying associates with new skills and training. Through these programs, we give our associates the tools to succeed, learn new skills and develop their careers.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Associate engagement and retention require an understanding of the needs of a diverse, creative and purpose-driven workforce. We firmly believe that working in a culture focused on diversity, equity and inclusion spurs innovation, creates healthy and high-performing teams, and delivers superior customer experiences. We aim to provide equal opportunity for all employees. We have several systems under which associates can report incidents or discrimination confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal. As of the end of fiscal 2022, approximately 67.4% of our total workforce identified as female and approximately 43.7% identified as an ethnic minority group. Additionally, approximately 54.8% of our Vice Presidents and above identified as female. We were also included in the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, which tracks public companies’ commitment to gender equality.
We are focused on increasing the representation of minority talent through hiring and career development. In June 2020, we established an Equity Action Plan and formed an Equity Action Committee, including a diverse group of executives and associates, to drive positive change in the fight for racial justice, and in 2022 we continued our commitment to equity through our partnership and donation support with our racial equity and justice non-profit partners such as the NAACP, the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the National Urban League, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice—Asian Law Caucus. 
We are currently building relationships with approximately 180 organizations, universities, colleges and networks to expand our reach to potential candidates. We continue to ensure we bring forward a diverse slate of candidates for all of our corporate roles posted externally, and have seen improvement in both overall representation and hire rate since we launched our Equity Action Plan. We are also a member of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, in which we pledged a goal to “identify and establish associate networks for underrepresented communities to promote diversity and inclusion throughout the Company.” In furtherance of our stated goal, we have developed associate equity networks including an LGBTQIA+ Network, Black Associate Network, Veterans Appreciation Network, Hispanic/LatinX Associate Network, Asian WSI Network, and a Disability, Education & Advocacy Network.
Safety/Health and Wellness 
Our vision is to provide a safe and healthy work environment for our associates and customers. Aligned with our values, we strive to continuously improve our work environments to keep our associates and customers as safe as possible. Our efforts include: 
•Incident and hazard reporting;
•Standard operating procedures aimed at reducing risk of injury;
•Associate and management training;
•Promotion of best practices; and
•Measurement of key safety metrics.
Compensation and Benefits 
We offer a benefits package designed to put our associates’ health and well-being, and that of their families, at the forefront. Depending on position and location, associates may be eligible for: 401(k) plan and other investment opportunities; paid vacations, holidays and other time-off programs; health, dental and vision insurance; health and dependent care tax-free spending accounts;

medical, family and bereavement leave; paid maternity/primary caregiver benefits; tax-free commuter benefits; wellness programs including telehealth visits; time off to volunteer, and matching donations to qualifying nonprofit organizations. In addition, consistent with our commitment to diversity and inclusion, we have expanded our benefit offerings to include coverage for transgender-inclusive services, including gender confirmation surgery and hormone therapy. As we strive to keep health care affordable and inclusive, we minimized cost increases to associates and, for a large portion of the associate population, decreased the cost of health care while adding offerings to support mental health and well-being. During fiscal 2022, we also raised our Company minimum wage to $16 per hour for U.S.-based hourly associates across our retail store, corporate, and supply chain workforce.
Community Involvement 
Through online and in-store donations, special product collaborations, and national and local fundraising, we give back to the communities we serve. We remain committed to our partnerships with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, No Kid Hungry, The Trevor Project, AIDS Walk, Canada Children’s Hospitals and the Arbor Day Foundation. We raised $4.0 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital during fiscal 2022, which included donations from our customers at time of purchase, special St. Jude-designated product sales where a portion of the sale was donated, employee donations, and donations from the Company. We also support organizations and partners, such as Good360 and Habitat for Humanity, who assist those with damaged or lost homes, or those seeking decent, affordable housing. We give charitable grants, donate our merchandise, donate proceeds from the sale of certain products, and provide matching grants for charitable donations made by our associates. Our Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Foundation also provides need-based grants to our associates directly impacted by federally-declared disasters.
We also support our communities through our associates’ time and leadership, and we provide 8 hours of paid Community Involvement Time each year to our eligible associates. Additionally, we brought back opportunities for associates to volunteer their time and talents with curated in-person events that support our local and national nonprofit partners. We believe volunteering deepens our presence in the community, enhances our relationships with customers and strengthens employee engagement.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE MATTERS
We believe that strategies that support the health of our planet, the well-being of our people and a shared sense of purpose foster long-term, sustainable growth for the Company. Our work continued to earn recognition across our industry. We were included in Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies for five years running, recognized as Sustainable Furnishings Council Top Scoring global company for sustainable wood furniture for the past five years, and were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the first time. Given the alignment of our ESG work with our strategic direction, our Board is highly engaged on the topic of sustainability. Since 2019, our Nominations, Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee and our Board have overseen ESG matters. The Nominations, Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility Committee oversees corporate policies and programs that speak to long-standing commitments to our associates, supply chain, environment, health and safety, human rights, cybersecurity and ethics. These policies and programs are relevant to our business, critical to our associates, and important to our customers. The Board of Directors’ oversees environmental and social matters through updates from WSI’s Executive Vice President of Sourcing, Quality Assurance, and Sustainable Development and annual updates from the organization’s dedicated sustainability team. The sustainability team presents to the full Board at least once a year to monitor and review existing and proposed strategy, goals and targets. The Executive Vice President leads both the organization’s dedicated global team of sustainability professionals as well as a working group of cross-functional leaders.
As a multinational retailer with a global supply chain, we are committed to responsible practices across our business—from designing and sourcing responsible products, to reducing waste, to working with suppliers to lower emissions and adopt sustainable business practices. We amplified our climate work in the past year, making progress towards our Science-Based Target for emissions reduction across our value chain. Building on the progress of our cotton and wood goals, we are aligning our preferred materials work with our climate strategy, using materials as part of our efforts to reach our Science-Based Target. In 2022, we drove progress towards our landfill diversion goal with stores implementing waste reduction initiatives, such as backhauling of expanded polystyrene foam. We continued to divert products from landfill into donation streams and to identify opportunities for waste reduction.
We hold our suppliers to high ethical standards, and we are committed to integrity and honesty throughout all aspects of our business. We require our vendors to adhere to the standards outlined in our Vendor Code of Conduct and accompanying implementation standards, which are informed by the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Hundreds of factories in our audit scope are audited annually by independent third-party audit firms to ensure compliance with our standards relating to labor practices, health and safety, environmental protection, ethical conduct, sub-contracting, management systems, and transparency. Using a continuous improvement model, we work alongside factories to improve working conditions.
