Concierge manages its operating businesses on a decentralized basis. There are no centralized or integrated operational functions such as marketing, sales, legal or other professional services and there is little involvement by Concierge’s management in the day-to-day business affairs of its operating subsidiary businesses. Concierge’s corporate management is responsible for capital allocation decisions, investment activities and selection and retention of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating subsidiaries. Concierge's corporate management is also responsible for corporate governance practices, monitoring regulatory affairs, including those of its operating businesses and involvement in governance-related issues of its subsidiaries as needed.  Across Concierge and its subsidiaries, the Company employs 90 full-time employees.
 
Subsidiary Business Overview
 
Wainwright
 
On December 9, 2016, Concierge acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock in Wainwright which is controlled by our CEO and majority shareholder Nicholas Gerber and another Concierge shareholder, Scott Schoenberger, a member of our board of directors. Wainwright operates through USCF and USCF Advisers, which collectively operate 13 exchange traded products (“ETPs”) and exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. ("NYSE Arca") with a total of approximately $2.4 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2019. Wainwright earns revenues through its subsidiaries' contractual agreements providing investment management and advisory services in exchange for management fees charged against the funds. Wainwright’s operating subsidiaries focus primarily on providing investment advisory services to funds that invest in a broad base or single commodity, particularly in oil, natural gas, gasoline and metals. Concierge acquired Wainwright in a stock-for-stock exchange for (i) 27,293,333 (as adjusted approximately for the 1 for 30 reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common and preferred stock effective on December 15, 2017, (the "2017 Reverse Stock Split")) shares of our common stock and (ii) 311,804 (as adjusted approximately for the 2017 Reverse Stock Split) shares of our Series B Voting, Convertible, Preferred stock (which preferred shares are convertible into approximately 6,236,079 shares of Company Common Stock).

Competition
 
Wainwright faces competition from other commodity fund managers, which include larger, better financed companies that offer products similar to Wainwright’s. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than Wainwright does, as well as greater experience in the discovery and development of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any products we may commercialize. Wainwright will continue to develop and consider new fund opportunities identified through its research efforts and review of market needs. However, the cost of launching and seeding new funds is dependent upon existing and new capital resources. The ability to successfully launch new funds competing with much larger financial institutions with greater financial and human capital will be challenging.
Regulation
 
Wainwright’s operating subsidiaries, USCF and USCF Advisers, are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to the investment services industry. USCF is a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the "CFTC") and the National Futures Association (the “NFA”) under the Commodities Exchange Act (“CEA”). USCF Advisers is an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended and has registered as a CPO under the CEA. ETPs issued or sponsored by USCF are required to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in accordance with the Securities Act of 1933. USCF Advisers advises exchange traded funds and a mutual fund (liquidated during the current fiscal year) registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Employees
 
Wainwright’s operating subsidiaries employ approximately 15 persons, a majority of whom are located in Walnut Creek, California. The operating subsidiaries are responsible for the retention of sub-advisers to manage the investments of each managed Funds’ assets in conformity with their respective investment policies if the operating subsidiary does not provide those services directly. Wainwright’s operating subsidiaries may also retain third-parties to provide custody, distribution, fund administration, transfer agency, and all other non-distribution related services necessary for each fund to operate. Wainwright, through its operating subsidiaries, bears all of its own costs associated with providing these advisory services and the expenses of the members of the board of directors of each fund who are affiliated with Wainwright.
Intellectual Property
 
Wainwright subsidiary USCF owns registered trademarks for USCF and USCF Advisers. The funds USCF is a general partner or sponsor of each have registered trademarks owned by USCF. Additionally, USCF was granted two patents Nos. 7,739,186 and 8,019,675, for systems and methods for an exchange traded fund (ETF) that tracks the price of one or more commodities.
Gourmet Foods
 
Gourmet Foods, Ltd. (“Gourmet Foods”), was organized in its current form in 2005 (previously known as Pats Pantry Ltd) and acquired by Concierge in August 2015. Pats Pantry was founded in 1966 to produce and sell wholesale bakery products, meat pies and patisserie cakes and slices, in New Zealand. Gourmet Foods, located in Tauranga, New Zealand, sells substantially all of its goods to supermarkets and service station chains with stores located throughout New Zealand. Gourmet Foods also has a large number of smaller independent lunch bars, cafes and corner dairies among the customer list, however they comprise a relatively insignificant dollar volume in comparison to the primary accounts of large distributors and retailers.
Products and Customers
 
Concierge, through Gourmet Foods, has three major customer groups comprising the gross revenues to Gourmet Foods; 1) grocery, 2) gasoline convenience stores, and 3) independent retailers. The grocery and food industry is dominated by several large chain operations, which are customers of Gourmet Foods, and there are no long term guarantees that these major customers will continue to purchase products from Gourmet Foods, however the relationships have been in place for sufficient time to give management reasonable confidence in their continuing business.
 
For the year ended and balance sheet date of June 30, 2019, Gourmet Foods’ largest customer in the grocery industry, who operates through a number of independently branded stores, accounted for approximately 22% of Gourmet Foods sales revenues and 28% of Gourmet Foods accounts receivable as compared to 21% and 33% for the prior year ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The second largest in the grocery industry accounted for approximately 12% of Gourmet Foods sales revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 as compared to 12% for the year ended June 30, 2018. This same group accounted for 19% of Gourmet Foods accounts receivable as of June 30, 2019 as compared to 16% as of June 30, 2018. In the gasoline convenience store market Gourmet Foods supplies two major channels. The largest is a marketing consortium of gasoline dealers operating under the same brand who, for the year ended and balance sheet date of June 30, 2019, accounted for approximately 43% of Gourmet Foods’ gross sales revenues as compared to 41% for the year ended June 30, 2018. No single member of the consortium is responsible for a significant portion of Gourmet Foods’ accounts receivable. The third category of independent retailers and cafes accounted for the remaining balance of Gourmet Foods’ gross sales revenue, however the group members are independently owned and individually responsible for their financial obligations with no one customer accounting for a significant portion of revenues or accounts receivable.
 
Sources and Availability of Materials
 
Gourmet Foods is not dependent upon any one major supplier as many alternative sources are available in the local market place should the need arise. However, the unavailability of, or increase in price in, any of the ingredients on which Gourmet Foods relies to produce its products could harm its operating results for such period.
 
Competition
 
Gourmet Foods faces competition from other commercial-scale manufacturers of meat pies located in New Zealand and Australia. Competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any products Gourmet Foods may commercialize. Larger competitors in New Zealand also enjoy a wider and more entrenched market share making it particularly difficult for us to penetrate certain market segments and, even if penetrated, might make it difficult to maintain. In an effort to expand its market presence and limit competitive interference, Gourmet Foods from time to time attempts to acquire other commercial-scale manufacturers of meat pies or confections. A recent attempt at such an acquisition was made during the current fiscal year, however failed subsequent to June 30, 2019 due to unsatisfactory results of due diligence discovery. (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)

Seasonality
 
The location of Gourmet Foods in the southern hemisphere provides them with a warm Christmas holiday season and some increased business as customers tend to be traveling and purchase more ready-to-eat foods. Although this increase in sales is observable, it is not deemed significant and the opposing seasons to the northern hemisphere work to offset any corresponding down turn in revenues for Brigadier, our Canadian subsidiary, during winter months. Overall, the consolidated business does not experience any material seasonality due to Gourmet Foods.
Regulation
 
In New Zealand our subsidiary, Gourmet Foods, is required to have certain permits from health regulatory agencies and export permits for certain products it chooses to export. Gourmet Foods is also subject to local regulations as are usual and customary for those in the food processing, manufacturing and distribution business.
Intellectual Property
 
Gourmet Foods, Ponsonby Pies and Pat’s Pantry are all registered trademarks of Gourmet Foods, Ltd.
 
Employees
 
Gourmet Foods employs approximately 45 persons in New Zealand.
 
Brigadier
 
On June 2, 2016, Concierge acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock in Brigadier, a Canadian corporation headquartered in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Brigadier sells and installs alarm monitoring and security systems to commercial and residential customers under brand names "Brigadier Security Systems" and "Elite Security" throughout the province of Saskatchewan with offices in Saskatoon and Regina.
Services, Products and Customers
 
Brigadier Security Systems (2000) Ltd. (“Brigadier”) was founded in 1985 and through internal growth and acquisitions the core business of Brigadier began in 1998. Today Brigadier is one of the largest SecurTek security monitoring dealers in Saskatchewan with offices in both major urban areas of Regina (dba Elite Security Systems (2005) Ltd.) and Saskatoon. SecurTek is owned by SaskTel which is Saskatchewan's leading Information and Communications Technology (ICT) provider with over 1.4 million customer connections across Canada. Brigadier is also a Honeywell Certified Access Control Integrator, Kantech Corporate Certified Integrator and UTC Interlogix Authorized dealer and the largest independent security contractor in the province. Brigadier provides comprehensive security solutions including access control, camera systems, ULC certified fire alarm panels, and intrusion alarms to home and business owners as well as government offices, schools and public buildings. Brigadier typically sells hardware to customers and brokers a 24/7 monitoring of their premises. The contract for monitoring the premises is typically supported by SecurTek, who pays Brigadier a monthly maintenance and support fee for each contract remaining in effect.
 
Concierge, through Brigadier, is partially dependent upon its contractual relationship with the alarm monitoring company who provides monitoring services to Brigadier’s customers. In the event this contract is terminated, Brigadier would be compelled to find an alternate source of alarm monitoring, or establish such a facility itself. Management believes that the contractual relationship is sustainable, and has been for many years, with alternate solutions available should the need arise. Sales to the largest customer, which includes contracts and recurring monthly support fees, totaled 46% and 41% of the total Brigadier revenues for the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively. The same customer accounted for approximately 37% of Brigadier's accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date of June 30, 2019 as compared to 35% as of June 30, 2018. Another large account, which has been a significant customer this fiscal year, contributed 12% of the total sales revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019 and nil for the year ended June 30, 2018. There were no accounts receivable from this customer as of the years ended June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018.
 
Sources and Availability of Materials
 
Brigadier purchases alarm panels, digital and analog cameras, mounting hardware and accessory items needed to complete security installations from a variety of sources. The manufacture of electronic items such as those sought by Brigadier has expanded to a global scale thus providing Brigadier with a broad choice of suppliers. Brigadier bases its vendor selection on several criteria including: price, availability, shipping costs, quality, suitability for purpose and the technical support of the manufacturer.
 
Competition
 
Although it holds a dominant market position in the province of Saskatchewan, Brigadier faces competition from larger, better financed companies that offer similar products and services. In addition, it is possible that Brigadier may face increasing competition as disruptive technologies enter the market. However, with respect to the market share it currently enjoys, Brigadier expects that their core customers will remain loyal and that an opportunity exists to capitalize on the deployment of new technologies. Brigadier's management will continue efforts to capture additional customers through organic growth and a focus on quality.
 
 8


Seasonality
 
Brigadier, due to its location in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada, is far enough north that winter weather has a negative effect on its ability to complete some installations, particularly those involving new construction. For this reason, the period from November through March typically produces less revenue than comparison periods during other seasons of the year. Although this decrease in sales is observable, the downturn in sales revenues for the winter months at Brigadier are offset in large part by the increase in revenues for our subsidiary Gourmet Foods in the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, the consolidated business does not experience any material seasonality due to Brigadier Security Systems.
Employees
 
Brigadier employs approximately 21 persons in Canada.
 
Original Sprout
 
Kahnalytics was founded in 2015 and adopted the dba/Original Sprout in December 2017 (see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For the year ended June 30, 2017  (prior to the acquisition of the Original Sprout assets), Kahnalytics had incurred de minimis operating losses insignificant to the overall enterprise. Prior to the acquisition of the Original Sprout assets, and as of June 30, 2017, the residual business the company was founded to oversee was being wound down and management expected to transition focus to another industry. As of June 30, 2018, this legacy business had been completely wound down.  Accordingly, the results of operations for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2018 reflects only two quarters of business operations with the newly acquired assets and should not be viewed as indicative of a full twelve-month period of operations. Similarly, there is no meaningful comparative data for the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2018 as the business included nominal subscription sales to a web hosted service and not the wholesale distribution of beauty products as it currently exists. 
Products and Customers
 
Original Sprout sells its products through 3 channels to market: 1) direct sales to end users via online shopping cart, 2) distributors who, in turn, sell to other retailers or wholesalers, and 3) to retail stores selling to end users.
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, Original Sprout, which operated with its current product offering for only 194 days, is not indicative of historical or future operations. For the actual concentration of risk with respect to the current business, focus is given for the period from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 and no comparison exists for the prior year period as only partial business in this sector was conducted by Original Sprout. Among thousands of customers, Original Sprout does have several major accounts with distributors however only one account represented 10% of our annual sales revenues. There were 3 major distributor accounts, all current, representing 25%, 17%, and 12% for a total of 54% of all accounts receivable as of June 30, 2019 as compared to 10%, 20% and 3%respectively as of June 30, 2018.
 
Sources and Availability of Materials
 
Concierge, through Original Sprout, is dependent upon its relationship with a product packaging company who, at the direction of Original Sprout, produces the products in accordance with proprietary formulas, packages them in appropriate containers, and delivers the finished goods to Original Sprout for distribution to its customers. All of Original Sprout’s products are currently produced by this packaging company, although if this relationship were to fail there are other similar packaging companies available to Original Sprout at competitive pricing. Because of the nature of the Original Sprout product ingredients, some of the ingredients may, at times, be difficult to source in timely fashion or at the expected price point. To safeguard against this possibility Original Sprout endeavors to maintain at least a 90-day supply of all products in stock. Estimating and maintaining a reserve stock account is not a guarantee that a shortage of ingredient supplies will not affect production such that Original Sprout will not exhaust its reserves or be unable to fulfill customer orders.
 
Competition
 
Original Sprout manufactures and distributes only 100% vegan, safe and non-toxic, hair and skin care products which we believe differentiate it significantly from other main-stream products. The use of organic and natural extracts is a growing trend in the U.S. and abroad, and other established brands are beginning to make products for this market. As more entrants to the high-end, vegan, hair care segment come into existence it is inevitable that some will be better financed and have more brand recognition and resources than those of Original Sprout. Original Sprout is focused on promoting its own brand name as a recognized pioneer in 100% vegan, safe, effective, hair care products through recruitment of addition distributors, nationwide retail stores, and increased social media presence with the expectation that establishing brand awareness will allow the continued growth of annual revenues and market share protection, though there can be no guarantees that such efforts will be sufficient to offset the effects of competition in the future.
 
 9


Seasonality
 
There is no significant seasonality for sales of products for Original Sprout, though sales will fluctuate around traditional holidays, and certain products, such as sun screen, will be lower in winter months than in summer months. Overall, the consolidated business does not experience any material seasonality due to Original Sprout.
Regulation
 
In the U.S. our subsidiary, Original Sprout, is not required to have permits for distribution of its products, however it chooses to gain recognition from certain testing laboratories and other quasi-regulatory agencies for compliance with accepted standards for hair and skin care ingredients and lack of toxic chemicals in their formulas and processes. For export, Original Sprout is often compelled to submit its products to foreign government agencies or certified laboratories for ingredient testing prior to being accepted for import as a “safe” product. The Original Sprout products comply with all applicable regulations, both domestic and foreign, in areas where they are sold or distributed.
Intellectual Property
 
The formulations and ingredient percentages of the many products of Original Sprout are considered its intellectual property, though many cannot be patented, they are maintained as confidential. The names "Original Sprout", "D’Organiques Original Sprout" are registered trademarks of Original Sprout.
Employees
 
Original Sprout employees 9 persons on a full time basis at its location in San Clemente, California.
