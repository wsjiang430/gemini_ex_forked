Item 1. | Business

Corporate Profile
Cousins Properties Incorporated (the “Registrant” or “Cousins”) is a Georgia corporation, which has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Cousins conducts substantially all of its business through Cousins Properties LP ("CPLP"), a Delaware limited partnership. Cousins owns approximately 98% of CPLP, and CPLP is consolidated with Cousins for financial reporting purposes. CPLP also owns Cousins TRS Services LLC ("CTRS"), a taxable entity which owns and manages its own real estate portfolio and performs certain real estate related services for other parties. Cousins, CPLP, their subsidiaries, and CTRS combined are hereafter referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company.” Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CUZ.” 
Our operations are conducted through a number of segments based on our method of internal reporting, which classifies operations by property type and geographical area.
Company Strategy
Our strategy is to create value for our stockholders through ownership of the premier urban office portfolio in the Sunbelt markets of the United States, with a particular focus on Georgia, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona. This strategy is based on a disciplined approach to capital allocation that includes value-add acquisitions, selective development projects, and timely dispositions of non-core assets. This strategy is also based on a simple, flexible, and low-leveraged balance sheet that allows us to pursue investment opportunities at the most advantageous points in the cycle. To implement this strategy, we leverage our strong local operating platforms within each of our major markets. 
2018 Activities
During 2018, we commenced two new development projects and completed two development projects. At year-end, we had four development projects in process; our share of the total expected costs of these projects totaled $245.9 million. We also improved our balance sheet and liquidity by expanding and extending our unsecured credit facility ("Credit Facility") and repaying one mortgage loan. The following is a summary of our significant 2018 activities:
Investment Activity

• | Commenced construction of 10000 Avalon, a 251,000 square foot office building in Atlanta, adjacent to our existing 8000 Avalon building. This project is being developed in a joint venture in which we hold a 90% interest, and the project is expected to be completed in 2020.


• | Commenced construction of 300 Colorado, a 358,000 square foot office building in downtown Austin. This project is being developed in a joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest, and the project is expected to be completed in 2021. 


• | Completed the development and commenced operations of Spring & 8th (864 and 858 Spring Street), two office buildings totaling 765,000 square feet in Midtown Atlanta that comprise NCR's headquarters.


• | Continued development of Dimensional Place, a 282,000 square foot building in Charlotte that will become the East Coast headquarters of Dimensional Fund Advisors. This project is being developed in a 50-50 joint venture with Dimensional Fund Advisors and is expected to be completed in 2019.


• | Acquired interests in two tracts of land in Midtown Atlanta and a tract of land in Tempe for potential future office development projects. With the addition of these sites, we own or control sites that could accommodate development of up to 1.4 million square feet of new Class A office space.

Environmental Matters
Our business operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing land, water, and wetlands resources. Among these are certain laws and regulations under which an owner or operator of real estate could become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances present on or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may subject the owner to substantial liability and may adversely affect the owner’s ability to develop the property or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. 
We typically manage this potential liability through performance of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and, as necessary, Phase II environmental sampling, on properties we acquire or develop. Even with these assessments and testings, no assurance can be given that environmental liabilities do not exist, that the reports revealed all environmental liabilities, or that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us. In certain situations, we have also sought to avail ourselves of legal and regulatory protections offered by federal and state authorities to prospective purchasers of property. Where applicable studies have resulted in the determination that remediation was required by applicable law, the necessary remediation is typically incorporated into the acquisition or development activity of the relevant property. We are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations.
Certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of a property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. A transfer of the property does not necessarily relieve an owner of such liability. Thus, although we are not aware of any such situation, we may have such liabilities on properties previously sold. We believe that we and our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations governing the environment. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Environmental issues."
Competition
We compete with other real estate owners with similar properties located in our markets and distinguish ourselves to tenants/buyers primarily on the basis of location, rental rates/sales prices, services provided, reputation, and the design and condition of the facilities. We also compete with other real estate companies, financial institutions, pension funds, partnerships, individual investors, and others when attempting to acquire and develop properties.
