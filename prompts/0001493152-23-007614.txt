--------+---------

Overview
 
Incorporated in Delaware in 1984, Kopin Corporation (“Kopin” or “the Company”) is a leading developer and provider of high-performance application-specific optical solutions consisting of high-resolution microdisplays, microdisplays subassemblies and related components for defense, enterprise, industrial, and consumer products. Our products are used for soldier, avionic, armored vehicle, and training & simulation defense applications; industrial, public safety and medical headsets; 3D optical inspection systems; and consumer augmented reality (“AR”) and virtual reality (“VR”) wearable headsets systems.
 
As part of our plan to focus our resources on new and existing defense, industrial and consumer applications that are in line with our strategic plan, in January 2023, we conducted a partial spinout of our organic light emitting diode (“OLED”) development unit to Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc. (“Lightning Silicon”). Lightning Silicon received a license to certain Kopin intellectual property to develop, manufacture and sell OLED technologies for use in the consumer market. We received an equity interest in Lightning Silicon and expect to receive royalties from the sale of products related to the licenses. We retained the ability and rights to develop, manufacture and sell OLED displays and complete optical solutions that include microdisplays to our core base in the defense and enterprise markets, as well as value added consumer applications. Lightning Silicon is a company formed by Dr. John C.C. Fan, our Chairman of the Board, and former Chief Executive Officer, to develop and supply advanced OLED microdisplays for the consumer augmented reality and virtual reality markets.


Our strategy is to focus on providing our customers application-specific optical solutions, which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. We offer display technologies, from our portfolio of display technologies (micro inorganic light emitting diode (“MicroLED”), OLED, liquid crystal on silicon (“LCOS”), and active-matrix liquid crystal displays (“AMLCDs”)) with specific optical designs, and drive electronics in a subassembly for the customer’s particular application. Typically, our product offerings provide a digital image which is overlayed on the analog world.
 
Our primary current sources of product revenues are from the sale of display and optical components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and development contracts primarily for U.S. defense programs. We believe we also are well-positioned with our technology and intellectual property, manufacturing capabilities and partnerships and reputation to take advantage of the emerging market for AR and VR applications and products of which microdisplays are the cornerstone technology. At the center of all our products is a display. We are the only company, to our knowledge, that offers AMLCDs, LCOS displays and OLED displays, and related optics, which enable us to serve the markets and customers based on their need and the problems they are trying to solve. We are also in development to create MicroLED displays. We believe our display technologies, combined with our extensive expertise in optics, system electronics and human factors, are the reason why many customers come to us.
 
The components we offer for sale consist of our proprietary miniature AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED display technologies, application specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”), backlights, and optical lenses. We refer to our AMLCD as “CyberDisplay®,” our LCOS displays/Spatial Light Modulators (“SLMs”) as “Time Domain Imaging TM technology”, and our OLED displays as “Lightning® displays”. Our transmissive AMLCDs are designed in Westborough, Massachusetts, have initial manufacturing steps performed in Taiwan and then are completed in our facility in Westborough, Massachusetts.
 
Our AMLCD components are sold separately or in subassemblies. For example, we offer a display as a single product, a display module which includes a display, an optical lens and backlight contained in either plastic or metal housings, a binocular display module which has two displays, lenses and backlights, and a higher-level assembly which has additional components for defense applications. Examples of products manufactured by our customers that include our AMLCD components include:
 

● | Weapon sights and target locators for soldiers to enable faster and more accurate target acquisition; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Weapon sight systems that support artificial intelligence (“AI”) based targeting systems in land-based armored systems, light vehicles, and tanks; 
● | Fighter pilot helmets that use our display to overlay information (targeting, plane operation, etc.) over the real world scene; 
● | Industrial headsets for applications such as field maintenance/service where a service worker can visually access diagrams and drawings in real time while keeping both hands free to conduct work or to access a remote expert with live video to help solve a problem remotely – thereby increasing productivity and effectiveness; 
● | Public safety devices such as firefighter masks that include our displays so that a firefighter may use the thermal imager to navigate a smoke-filled building; and 
● | AR and VR consumer products for recreational use including rifle sights. 

 
Our LCOS products are designed and manufactured at our Forth Dimension Displays (“FDD”) subsidiary in Dalgety Bay, Scotland. Our LCOS displays are often configured with drive electronics and sold as a package that makes it easier for our customers to design our displays into their end products. A significant portion of the LCOS displays is sold to customers for incorporation into SLMs, which are built into manufacturing equipment that are used for 3D optical measurement.
 
Our OLED displays provide either color or monochrome images and are offered in a variety of sizes and resolutions. We are currently developing color and monochrome MicroLED displays.
 
The AMLCD display driver ASICs we offer are the electronic interfaces between our displays and the products into which the displays are incorporated. The optical lenses and backlights we offer are based on either our proprietary designs or designs we license from third parties. The ASICs, optical lenses, and backlights are manufactured by third parties.
 
Our NVIS, Inc. (“NVIS”) subsidiary is a designer and manufacturer of defense and industrial head-mounted and hand-held VR products and training simulation defense equipment in Reston, Virginia. Depending on the size of the order, NVIS’s products are either manufactured in its Reston, Virginia facility or by a contract manufacturer in the U.S.A. NVIS products allow customers to visualize and interact with simulated 3D environments and equipment for training purposes. Our customers develop high-fidelity training and simulation applications that require high-performance visuals, intuitive controls, and unsurpassed customer support.

The focus of our internally funded research and development activities is on our OLED and MircoLED display technologies. Previously we used internally funded research and development funds to design headset systems that were focused on the emerging enterprise and consumer markets for head-worn, hands-free, voice-and gesture-controlled wireless computing and communication devices. We continue to license our previously designed systems under agreements that may include a royalty payable to us and a purchase and supply agreement that requires us to supply our customers and our customers to buy our components for integration into their products. The licenses may convey the right of exclusivity for a particular market or geographic area.
 
In addition to sales of our components and subassemblies, we also derive a significant portion of our revenue from developing custom product solutions for our customers which we refer to as Funded Research and Development. We enter into development agreements with the goal of successfully developing a customer product and then winning the production orders for such products once design is complete and tested. These development programs can take several years. The Funded Research and Development process typically adds to Kopin’s knowledge base and expertise, putting us in a better position for future business. The Funded Research and Development arrangements typically have various milestones we are required to achieve to be reimbursed for our efforts. These arrangements are normally fixed price and may be cancelled by the customer on short notice. We also believe that the technologies developed for the U.S. defense industry can eventually be used in commercial and enterprise applications and subsequently in consumer applications.
 
Sales to significant non-affiliated customers for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, as a percentage of total revenues, were as follows:

Augmented and Virtual Reality
 
The introduction and wide acceptance of the smartphone has generated advances in many technologies including smaller and cheaper electronic components, voice search engines, and wireless 4G and 5G networks. Smartphone adoption has also been the catalyst for the development of software for a wide range of applications. Leveraging off these new technologies and the growth of cloud computing, a new category of emerging AR and VR markets is starting to develop. These AR technologies are being used by the military to provide personnel with enhanced situational awareness by overlaying digital imaging over the real-world scene. These technologies can also be used for hundreds of different applications by enterprise workers, public safety officials, and consumers, bringing ever-increasing productivity, fun, and convenience.

We believe that defense, industrial, and consumer companies are looking at AR and VR as new applications and computing platforms. In addition, wireless network companies are encouraging the development of more products and applications that utilize their network capacity, and other companies are developing products that provide continuous access to digital content. For these markets to develop and grow, advances and investment in display technology, optics, application software, and wireless communications systems with greater bandwidth such as 5G networks will be necessary. These advances in display technologies must increase performance but at the same time the cost of displays must decrease.
 
Our Solution
 
Kopin Technology
 
Kopin technology includes the ability to design, and in most cases, manufacture proprietary small form factor AMLCD, LCOS, OLED and MicroLED displays and optical lenses and the know-how to design and manufacture components and subassemblies based on our display technologies. We also offer proprietary backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. Our components are used in our customers’ products, such as headsets for field service personnel, medical professionals, or consumer rifle scopes. We also offer backlights and ASICs that work with our AMLCD displays. The subassemblies we offer combine one or two of our displays, backlight, ASIC, complex optics, and other electronics in an assembly that is then included in a larger system (for example a weapon sight or a targeting system in an armored vehicle). These subassemblies must survive the shock and vibration of weapons fire and operate in extreme environmental conditions. The considerable know-how that goes into the design, materials selection, assembly, and testing of these subassemblies is an important part of our technology.
Display Products
 
Small form factor displays used in near-eye applications are widely used in defense in many applications such as thermal weapon sights, avionic helmets and training and simulation systems. Small form factor near-eye displays currently have more limited use in industrial products such as wearable headsets that allow users to view data, schematics, and videos to enable them to perform production or repairs. In addition, we believe small form factor near-eye displays are well suited for AR and VR consumer markets and will be a critical component in the development of these markets, which we believe will grow in the coming years. We believe our small form factor displays have certain advantages with respect to small size, resolution, brightness, and low power consumption that are advantageous for product design and usage.
 
There are several microdisplay technologies commercially available including transmissive, reflective, and emissive. Our principal display products are miniature high-density color or monochrome AMLCDs that range from approximately 428 x 240 resolution to 2048 x 2048 (“2K”) resolution and are sold in either a transmissive or reflective format. We offer emissive OLED displays with a resolution of 1280 x 720 (“720p”), 2048 x 2048 2K, 1280 x 960 (“QVGA”) and have demonstrated a 2560 x 2560 (“2.6K”). We sell our displays individually or in combination with our other components assembled in a unit. For example, we offer a display as a product, a module product unit that includes a single display, backlight and optics in a plastic housing, a binocular display module product that includes two displays, backlights and optics in a plastic housing, and a subassembly that we refer to as an HLA (“Higher-Level Assembly”) that contains a display, light emitting diode based illumination, optics, and electronics in a sealed housing, primarily for defense applications.
 
Our transmissive AMLCD products, which we refer to as CyberDisplay® products, utilize high-quality, single-crystal-on-silicon, which is the same high-quality silicon used in conventional integrated circuits. This single-crystal-on-silicon is not grown on glass; rather, it is first formed on a silicon wafer and patterned into an integrated circuit (including the active matrix, driver circuitry and other logic circuits) at an integrated circuit foundry. These processes enable the manufacture of miniature active-matrix circuits that are comparable to higher resolution displays relative to passive and other active matrix displays that are fabricated on glass. Our foundry partners fabricate integrated circuits using our proprietary backplane designs for our displays in their foundries in Taiwan. The fabricated wafers are then returned to our facilities, where we lift the integrated circuits off the silicon wafers and transfer them to glass using our proprietary Wafer Engineering technology. The transferred integrated circuits are then processed, packaged with liquid crystal, and assembled into display panels at our Display Manufacturing Center in Westborough, Massachusetts. When combined with the appropriate optic, the display provides the user with a high-resolution, full-screen experience.

Our proprietary technology enables the production of transparent circuits on a transparent substrate, in contrast to conventional silicon circuits, which are on an opaque substrate. Our CyberDisplay products’ imaging properties are a result of the inclusion of a liquid crystal layer between the active-matrix integrated circuit glass and the transparent cover glass. We believe our manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional active-matrix LCD manufacturing approaches, including:
 

● | Greater miniaturization; 
--+-----------------------------
● | Higher pixel density; 
● | Lower power consumption; and
● | Higher brightness. 

 
The color CyberDisplay products generate colors by using color filters with a white backlight. Color filter technology is a process in which display pixels are patterned with materials, which selectively absorb or transmit the red, green, or blue colors of light.
 
Our reflective LCOS display products are miniature high-density, dual mode color sequential/monochrome reflective microdisplays with resolutions that range from approximately 1280 x 768 pixels (“WXGA”) resolution to 2K resolution. These displays are manufactured by our FDD subsidiary in Scotland. Our reflective displays are based on a proprietary, high-speed, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon (“FLCOS”) platform. Our digital software and logic-based drive electronics combined with the very fast switching binary liquid crystal, enables our microdisplays to process images purely digitally and create red, green, and blue gray scale in the time domain. This architecture has major advantages in visual performance over other liquid crystal, organic light-emitting diode, and microelectromechanical systems-based technologies: precisely controlled full color or monochrome gray scale is achieved on a matrix of undivided high fill factor pixels, motion artifacts are reduced to an insignificant level, and there are no sub-pixels, no moving mirrors, and no analog conversions to detract from the quality of the image.
 
The FLCOS device is comprised of two substrates. The first is a pixelated silicon-based complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) substrate which is manufactured by our foundry partner based on our proprietary backplane design using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. The silicon substrate forms the display’s backplane, serving as both the active matrix to drive individual pixels and as a reflective mirror. The second substrate is a front glass plate. Between the backplane and the front glass substrate is a ferroelectric liquid crystal material which, when switched, enables the incoming illumination to be modulated.
 
Our OLED technology can emit light when electrical current flows through its electroluminescent layers as opposed to our AMLCD which requires a separate light source. Our OLED microdisplays have a top-emitting structure built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than on glass. An OLED display typically has a wider viewing angle than an AMLCD. Light from an OLED appears evenly distributed in the forward directions, and so a slight movement of the eye relative to the display does not perceive the change in the image brightness or color. OLED displays can also have a much higher contrast ratio than AMLCDs, which is desirable for some user applications.
 
Kopin is aims to disrupt the OLED microdisplays industry with a new fabless, scalable business model. We believe the partitioning of OLED manufacturing into multiple parties, each focusing on their core competencies, can make a significant difference in OLED microdisplays performance and supply chain, while reducing the capital cost and overhead costs of entering this business. Making OLED microdisplays involves three major steps: designing backplane circuits, processing silicon wafers to generate backplane wafers, and deposition of OLED layers on silicon backplane wafers and packaging the displays. We believe backplane design is the most intellectual property-intensive area. Kopin has more than 20 patents granted or pending on the design of OLED backplanes to get low power consumption, high frame rates, and more uniform display images. Kopin has established relationships with two silicon foundries to produce OLED backplane wafers. We believe Kopin’s Lightning® backplane technology and the emergence of high-volume OLED manufacturing facilities can reduce the cost of manufacturing OLED displays, thereby expanding the applications for OLED microdisplays.
 
Our proprietary technology in OLED microdisplays lies mainly in the design of the integrated circuits or “backplane” upon which OLED microdisplays are built. The backplane drives the performance of the display.

Two of the biggest challenges for the OLED microdisplays for AR and VR applications are low brightness and short lifetime. Kopin is working to solve both issues with a double OLED stack approach. We believe most OLED microdisplays commercially available in volume to date have been made with a single-stack OLED structure, namely consisting of a one junction organic diode structure. A duo-stack OLED consists of two OLED structures connected in series so that carriers (electrons-holes) pass through the duo-stack OLED and generate photons twice, instead of once as in the case of a single-stack OLED structure. This structure enables higher brightness without a commensurate increase in power and without the longevity (burn-in) issues which have plagued previous high-brightness single-stack OLED displays. In addition, we believe Kopin’s proprietary ColorMax ™ technology provides an accurate and wide color spectrum without the color mixing that has previously prevented duo-stack OLED structures from rendering accurate color. In addition, we have a proprietary embedded anode structure within the backplane design which we believe will make the design integration of our display in a finished product less complicated for product designers. We call this technology Display on a Chip (DoC). We believe our patent-pending backplane technologies can provide superior performance compared to other OLED products in the market in terms of brightness, power consumption, longevity and color accuracy and we believe these features will improve further as our technology matures.
 
We have engaged foundry services for the fabrication of the Lightning® OLED backplane wafers. Our model is to sell these wafers to foundries that deposit the organic material on the backplane and manufacture the displays. The deposition foundries will either sell the displays to their customers or to us for resale to our customers. We believe this outsourcing model allows us to leverage our underlying backplane intellectual property as well as the existing infrastructure to obtain lower cost manufacturing and avail ourselves of manufacturing technology improvements as they occur.
 
Currently we have several OLED microdisplays including a 2K display with 2048 x 2048 resolution in a 0.99” diagonal size, which are aimed at VR and Mixed Reality applications; and a 720p display with 1280 x 720 resolution in a 0.49” diagonal size, which is aimed at AR applications. We have also demonstrated a 2.6K x 2.6K with 2560 x 2560 resolution in a 1.3” diagonal display, which is aimed at VR applications, and a QVGA display with 1280 x 960 resolution in a 0.5” diagonal size, which is aimed at electronic viewfinder and AR applications. Our OLED microdisplays have a combo C-PHY/D-PHY Mobile Industry Processor Interface and display stream compression to allow 120 Hz operation at the full resolution. This display is designed for high-end VR and content streaming applications.
 
Kopin is also exploring the development of MicroLED microdisplays which offer the possibility of high brightness, wide viewing angle, excellent contrast, and low cost. Kopin is working with other partners to explore the potential benefits and implementation of the technology. If Kopin is successful in developing prototypes, then we expect that high-volume manufacturing process development may be required, including the development of equipment.
 
By offering transmissive, reflective, and emissive microdisplays technologies today and working with potential customers for MicroLEDs in the future, we believe we can uniquely support whichever technology is best suited for a given application. Transmissive and reflective AMLCDs are typically used in bright light conditions as their brightness can be modulated over a wide range by controlling the backlight operation. OLED displays currently have less brightness range but offer superior contrast and response time characteristics and therefore are better suited in an immersive products environment that blocks out ambient light.
 
Optical Lenses and Backlights
 
We offer a variety of optical lenses, some of which we have developed internally and others for which we license the rights to sell. We also offer a variety of backlights, some of which we have developed internally and some of which are “off-the-shelf” components. The lenses come in a variety of sizes with the smallest being our Pupil™, followed by our Pearl™ and Pancake™ lenses. The different sizes of lenses give us and our customers design flexibility when creating headset systems. There is a trade-off between the lens size and the size of the perceived image to the viewer. For example, a Pearl™ lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking directly at a smartphone, whereas a Pancake™ lens will provide the viewer with an immersive experience. We use third parties to manufacture these lenses.

Headset Systems
 
We license an industrial headset reference design, which is a complete head-worn computer that connects to the Internet wirelessly and includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a microprocessor, battery, camera, memory, and various commercially available software packages that we license. We also licensed an industrial headset reference design, which is a device that attaches to a pair of safety glasses, includes an optical pod with one of our display products and a camera and is operated primarily through the use of voice. The display module or optical pod allows users to view information such as maintenance diagrams and instruction sets, Internet data, emails, text messages, maps or other data at a “normal” size because of our specialized optics. Our industrial headsets provide the capability of viewing technical diagrams, by enabling the user to zoom in to see finer details or zoom out to see a larger perspective. We are also developing a headset for the medical market.
Strategy
 
Our product strategy is to enter Funded Research and Development programs with U.S. defense prime contractors to invent, develop, manufacture, and sell (or license) leading-edge critical technology and microdisplays components and subassemblies that will be used in rugged environments. We intend to use the know-how gained and technology developed from these defense development programs and products to create products that can be used in industrial, enterprise, medical and ultimately consumer applications. The products we develop typically include a microdisplay, optics, and an ASIC in a sealed housing. The products we make for the defense market must be able to withstand the extreme shock and vibration experienced in weapons fire. Accordingly, our intellectual property includes not just our patented microdisplays and a broad range of optics and but also our know-how to manufacture products that can withstand the shock and vibration of weapons fire and extreme environments. The critical elements of our strategy include:

● | Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in our markets and we have been accumulating a significant patent and know-how portfolio either by internal efforts or through acquisition. We own, exclusively license, or have the exclusive right to sublicense approximately 200 patents and patent applications issued and/or pending worldwide. An important piece of our strategy is to continue to accumulate valuable patented and non-patented technical know-how relating to our microdisplays, including backplane design, and other critical technologies for advanced wearable systems such as optics and drive electronics. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Maintain Our Technological Leadership in Defense and Industrial Markets. We are a recognized leader in the design, development, and manufacture of high-resolution microdisplay components and subassemblies for defense and industrial applications. We believe our ability to continue to develop components and subassemblies for defense applications enhances our opportunity to grow within our other non-defense targeted markets such as industrial, medical, and eventually AR and VR consumer markets. We perform research and development contracts for U.S. Government agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government. Under these contracts, the U.S. Government funds all or a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation microdisplays, related technologies and products for aviation systems such as pilot helmets, soldier-centric systems such as weapon sights, training and simulation systems and defense armored vehicles. This enables us to supplement our internal research and development budget with additional funding and adds to our expertise in technology, products, and systems. 
● | Understand Our Customer Needs. We believe our system know-how, be it a defense, industrial or consumer system, is a compelling reason why customers choose Kopin as their supplier. Unlike many of our competitors who only offer a display, we offer a range of display technologies, optics, backlights, and ASICs as either an individual component or in a system. We believe this enables us to provide superior technology solutions for our customers’ needs. Additionally, our human-factors and system understanding enables us to offer our customers valuable engineering services to solve their issues and reduce time to market for their products.

● | Internally Manufactured Products and Use of Third-Party Manufacturing. We design and manufacture our transmissive and reflective display products in facilities that we lease and manage. However, the initial manufacturing steps for fabricating the silicon wafers are performed at capital-intensive Taiwan foundries. With OLED displays, which we design, we similarly use silicon wafer foundries to produce our backplanes, and we also use OLED deposition foundries to perform the OLED deposition steps for our displays. The use of these third-party foundries reduces our investments in plant and equipment and working capital for new products and enables us to update designs as technology and manufacturing trends change.

Markets and Customers
 
Our business model is to primarily generate product revenues by selling display components and subassemblies to customers who offer defense, industrial or consumer products and to a lesser extent license our system designs and know-how. We also enter development contracts from customers to either design custom products for them or help them integrate our technology into their products (Funded Research and Development).
 
We currently sell our display products to our customers in various configurations including but not limited to a single display component, a module that includes a display, optic, backlight and focus mechanism and electronics, a binocular display module that includes two displays, lenses, and backlights, and as HLAs for defense customers. A HLA is similar to a module but includes additional components such as an eye cup specific to a defense application.
 
We have sold our AMLCD products to Collins Aerospace, Elbit, and DRS RSTA Inc. for use in defense applications, to RealWear and Iristik for enterprise wearable products, and to Scott Safety for public safety applications. We have sold our LCOS display products to Saki, Jutze and Mirtec for use in 3D metrology equipment. Our revenues from our OLED displays have primarily been from development contracts with customers that are designing our displays into their products.
 
For our AMLCD display products to function properly in their intended applications, ASICs and backlights are generally required. Several companies have designed ASICs to work with our display products and our customers can procure these chip sets directly from the manufacturer or through us.
 
For fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, sales to defense customers, excluding research and development contracts, as a percentage of total revenue were 52%, 40% and 50%, respectively. For fiscal year 2022, Collins Aerospace and DRS Network & Imaging Systems LLC accounted for approximately 28% and 40% of our revenues, respectively.
 
For fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, research and development revenues, primarily from multiple contracts with various prime contractors of U.S. Government agencies, accounted for approximately 30%, 32% and 25%, respectively, of our total revenues.
 
Product Development
 
We believe that continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. Our industrial and consumer products tend to have one-to three-year life cycles. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with our customers to continue our product development efforts. Our primary development efforts are focused on AMLCD display subassemblies for defense and industrial applications and OLED display components for defense, industrial and consumer applications.
Component Products and Subassemblies
 
The pixel size of our current AMLCD transmissive display products ranges from 6.8 to 15 microns. These pixel sizes are much smaller than a pixel size of approximately 100 microns in a typical laptop computer display. The resolutions of our current commercially available AMLCD display products are 428 x 240, 640 x 360, 640 x 480, 854 x 480, 800 x 600, 1,280 x 720 and 1,280 x 1,024 and 2048 x 2048 pixels. The pixel size of our current reflective display products ranges from 8.2 to 13.6 microns. The resolutions of our current commercially available reflective display products are 1,280 x 768, 1,280 x 1,024, 2,048 x 1,536, and 2,048 x 2,048 pixels.

Our AMLCD display product development efforts are primarily focused on improving performance and reducing manufacturing costs. We are continually evaluating our display manufacturing process to reduce costs. Our defense products include subassemblies, and our advanced subassemblies are referred to as HLAs. The HLA may include a display and multiple optical lenses in a hermetically sealed housing. The HLAs are made to very exact tolerances, which require Kopin to manage its supply chain to procure raw materials that meet specification while enabling Kopin to achieve high yields.
 
The pixel size of our current OLED displays range from 7.8 to 9.2 microns with resolutions of 1,280 x 720, 2,048 x 2,048 and 2,560 x 2,560. We have only recently commenced OLED display developments and therefore our OLED products are much less mature than our AMLCD products.
 
We offer components such as our optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs, manufactured to our specifications, which we then buy and resell. The components that are made to order rely on either intellectual property we developed or acquired or that we license from third parties.
 
Funded Research and Development
 
We have entered various development contracts with agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. These contracts help support the continued development of our core technologies. We intend to continue to pursue development contracts for applications that relate to our defense and commercial product applications. Our contracts contain certain milestones relating to technology development and may be terminated prior to completion of funding. Our funded development projects often lead to a product or component supply agreement. Our policy is to retain our proprietary rights with respect to the principal commercial applications of our technology, however, we are not always able to retain our proprietary rights. To the extent technology development has been funded by a U.S. federal agency, under applicable U.S. federal laws the federal agency that provided the funding has the right to obtain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, fully paid license to practice or have practiced this technology for governmental use. In addition, we may be required to negotiate intellectual property rights with our defense prime contractors. For our commercial development agreements, customers often obtain exclusive rights to a particular display or technology that is developed either permanently or for some period. Revenues attributable to research and development contracts for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $14.4 million, $14.7 million and $10.1 million, respectively.
Competition
 
Kopin’s strategy is to focus on providing our customers application specific optical solutions which sets us apart from our competition who typically only provide displays. We offer display technologies, from our portfolio of display technologies (MicroLED, OLED, LCOS and AMLCD), with specific optical designs, and drive electronics in a subassembly for the customer’s particular application. Typically, our product offerings provide a digital image which is overlayed on the analog world.
 
The general commercial display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large Asian-based electronics companies, including AUO, BOE Technology Group, Himax, LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Texas Instruments. In addition, several companies focus on OLED microdisplays including eMAGIN, MicroOLED, Olightek, BOE Technology, Seeya, Seiko Epson and Sony. The display market consists of multiple segments, each focusing on different end-user applications applying different technologies. Competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics, product quality, size, and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. The success of our display product offerings will also depend upon the adoption of our display products by consumers as an alternative to other active-matrix LCDs or OLEDs and upon our ability to compete against other types of well-established display products and new emerging display products. Particularly significant is a consumer’s willingness to use a near-eye display device, as opposed to a direct-view display that may be viewed from several inches to several feet. Assuming a user is willing to use a near-eye display device, companies such as Samsung and Meta are offering near-eye virtual reality headset products that use large display panels on glass to provide the image as opposed to using microdisplays. Displays on glass typically have lower resolution than our products but are lower in cost on a per square inch basis. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against these companies and technologies, or that consumers will accept the use of such eyewear in general or our customers’ product form factor specifically.

There are also several AMLCD, LCOS, OLED, MicroLED and alternative display technologies in development and production. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or are developing products based on these technologies. We outsource the manufacturing of our OLED displays to Chinese foundries. We expect these foundries to offer their own products. Our display products will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies.
 
There are many companies whose sole business is the development and manufacture of optical lenses, backlights, and ASICs. These companies may have significantly more intellectual property and experience than we do in the design and development of these components. We do not manufacture optical lenses, backlights, or ASICs but we either have them made to our specifications or buy standard off-the-shelf products.
 
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 
An important part of our product development strategy is to seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology through the use of various U.S. and foreign patents and contractual arrangements. We intend to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively. Many of our U.S. patents and applications have counterpart foreign patents, foreign patent applications or international patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated business employed 177 individuals. Of these employees, 8 hold Ph.D. degrees in Material Science, Electrical Engineering or Physics. Our management and professional employees have significant prior experience in semiconductor materials, device transistor and display processing, optical design, manufacturing and other related technologies. Our employees are located in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the laws regarding employee relationships are different by jurisdiction. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have policies to prevent discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. We take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are hired, and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or national origin. We also take affirmative action to employ and advance veterans in employment. We consider relations with our employees to be good.
 
In 2004, we finalized and adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics regarding the standards of conduct of our directors, officers and employees. The code is reviewed and updated periodically by our Board of Directors and is available on our website at www.kopin.com.
 
Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) Initiatives
 
We strive to create and maintain a working environment that fosters honesty and hard work and rewards all of our employees’ hard work. We endeavor to make Kopin Corporation a place people are proud to be associated with. With the growing awareness of environmental and social issues we are in the process of creating a more formalized ESG strategy. Our initial process for the strategy creation includes work by a cross-functional ESG team of leaders representing operations, human resources, supply chain, finance, marketing, and facilities departments. We also utilize third-party facility, environmental and legal consulting services. These third-party consultants are assisting us in creating an ESG materiality assessment from which we can develop a baseline assessment for monitoring our progress. Our progress in creating our ESG strategy and other related activities are reported to the Board of Directors.
 
We provide recurring company-wide communication of our formalized values, a summary of which are:
 

Integrity | Team | Customers 
------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uphold Ethical Standards in Our Performance | Treat Everyone with Respect | Highest Quality Customer Service Through Collaborative Success 
Keep Our Commitments | Encourage Open Communication | Provide Industry Leading Products 
Protect Our Intellectual Property | Promote Critical Thinking and Innovation | Maintain Confidentiality and Protect Customer Intellectual Property 

 
We are not a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”); however, we have utilized the themes of the RBA Code of Conduct to supplement our Code of Ethics, including the RBA Code of Conduct’s five critical areas of corporate social responsibility: labor, health and safety, environment, management systems, and ethics. We believe that following by the values noted above and doing our part in each of these areas, we can achieve our business objectives and long-term stockholder value. For additional information, see “Item 1 – Business: Human Capital Resources” in this Form 10-K.

We strive to create a workplace based on the following principles and goals:
 
Care for Our People
 
● We believe in upholding the principles of human rights, worker safety, and observing fair labor practices within our organization.
 
● We respect different viewpoints and perspectives, and ultimately individual thoughts create innovation and achieve better results. We continually evaluate how we provide organizational training, formalize company values, and revitalize recruitment strategy.
 
● We are committed to employee safety. We have installed safety protocols and monitoring systems. We have periodic audits by third parties to test our systems and perform preventive maintenance. Our policies prohibit an employee from being alone in our production facilities or in unsupervised areas of our facilities.
 
Environmental Responsibility
 
● We are committed to protecting the natural environment and our community by complying with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We maintain an environmental management system and a specific framework for implementing relevant sustainable practices.
 
● We ask our employees to help us contribute towards environmental sustainability by looking for opportunities to conserve energy, reduce consumption of natural resources, preserve air and water quality, manage waste properly, reuse and recycle, and reduce the use of toxic substances in our operations where possible, including, in particular, in our clean room and lab facilities. Our clean room facility emissions are less than permitting and reporting thresholds, and we track emissions monthly to verify compliance with the regulations.
 
● We look for ways to reduce energy consumption in our facilities around the world, including upgrades and/or retrofits to smart heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. For instance, we have installed variable speed fans, which only turn on based on various metrics, thereby reducing energy usage.
 
Ethics & Corporate Responsibility
 
● We are committed to ensuring ethical organizational governance and embracing diversity and inclusion in the board room and throughout the organization.
 
● We are committed to observing fair, transparent, and accountable operating practices.
 
● We seek to create and foster a healthy, balanced, and ethical work environment for everyone in our organization. To this end, we promote an ethical organizational culture and encourage all employees to raise questions or concerns about actual or potential ethical issues and company policies and to offer suggestions about how we can make our organization better. We have a Whistleblower Ethics Hotline that includes global telephone access and online access. We have an independent third party periodically test the Whistleblower Ethics Hotline.
Supply Chain Responsibility
 
● We intend to request that our suppliers adhere to the RBA Code of Conduct or its equivalent by flowing this requirement through our commercial contracts.
 
● We also adhere to Rule 13p-1 under the Exchange Act and support efforts to avoid sourcing conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in adjoining countries. Consistent with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance concerning conflict minerals, we adopted the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative Due Diligence reporting process and seek to obtain conflict minerals content declarations from our suppliers each year, all in an effort to promote supply chain transparency. We do not directly source tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (collectively referred to as 3TG) from mines, smelters or refiners, and we are in most cases several or more levels removed from these supply chain participants.

Government Regulations
 
Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including but not limited to branches of the Department of Defense (“DoD”).
 
U.S. defense contractors are among our largest customers, representing a substantial majority of our total revenues. The U.S. Government may terminate a contract with us or our customers either “for convenience” (for instance, due to a change in its perceived needs) or if we default due to our failure or the failure of a general or subcontractor to perform under the contract. If the federal government terminates a contract with one of our customers, our contract with our customers generally would entitle us to recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and possibly profit on the work completed prior to termination. However, under certain circumstances, our recovery costs upon termination for convenience of such a contract may be limited. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source, and any other damages it suffers.
 
In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations including the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production or cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. Certain chemicals we import are subject to regulation by the U.S. Government. If we or our suppliers do not comply with applicable laws, we could be subject to adverse government actions and may not be able to import critical supplies.
 
We are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) laws which regulate the protection (cybersecurity) and export of technical data and export of products to other nations that may use such data or products for defense purposes. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products, or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities.

We are also subject to federal importation laws that regulate the importation of raw materials and equipment from other nations that are used in our products. Failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations.
 
Investments in Related Businesses
 
On September 30, 2019 we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Solos Technology Limited (“Solos Technology”), pursuant to which we sold and licensed certain assets of our Solos product line and Whisper Audio (“Whisper”) technology. As consideration for the transaction, we received 1,172,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in Solos Technology’s parent company, Solos Incorporation (“Solos Inc.”). Our 20.0% equity stake will be maintained until Solos Inc. has raised a total of $7.5 million in equity financing after which we will need to participate in future equity offerings, or our ownership percentage will be diluted.
 
We acquired an equity interest in Lenovo New Vision in the first quarter of 2018 for $1.0 million and the contribution of certain intellectual property. As of December 31, 2022, we own approximately 10% interest in this investment and the carrying value of our investment is $1.6 million.
 
We acquired an equity interest in a medical device company in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of this investment is $0.3 million.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we own 100% of the outstanding common stock of NVIS and FDD and 80% of the outstanding common stock of e-MDT America (“eMDT”) and we consolidate each of their financial results within our consolidated financial statements.
 
We terminated operations of our subsidiary, Kopin Software Ltd., in the third quarter of 2019 and are in the process of liquidating it.
 
On January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement and an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “LST Agreements”) with Lightning Silicon Technology, Inc (“LST”). Pursuant to the LST Agreements, the Company issued a license to LST for certain technology associated with our Organic Light Emitting Technology, transferred in-process development contracts with two customers and accounts receivables that the Company had previously determined were not collectible. As consideration for the transaction, the Company received 18,000,000 common shares representing a 20.0% equity stake in LST. The Company will also receive a royalty based on unit sales of product that utilize the technology licensed. Drs. John Fan, the Company’s former President and CEO and current Chairman of the Board, Boryeu Tsaur, a former Executive Vice President of the Company and Hong Choi, the Company’s former Chief Technology Officer, terminated their employment with the Company and became investors in and members of the management team of LST. Dr. Fan is also the founder of LST.
 
We may from time to time make further equity investments in these and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of our business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies we need to invest in to enhance our product offering. These investments may not provide us with any financial return or other benefit, and any losses by these companies or associated losses in our investments may negatively impact our operating results.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
 
We rely on third-party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets, backlights and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers and chemicals. In addition, our CyberDisplay subassemblies, HLAs, binocular display modules, and other modules include lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components that we purchase from third-party suppliers. Some of these third-party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, our defense customers typically buy a small number of units, which prevents us from qualifying and buying components economically from multiple vendors. As a result, we are highly dependent on a select number of third-party contractors and suppliers.
Availability Information
 
We make available free of charge through our website, www.kopin.com, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and other reports that we file or furnish with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished, as well as certain of our corporate governance policies, including the charters for the Board of Directors’ audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees and our code of ethics, corporate governance guidelines and whistleblower policy. We will also provide to any person without charge, upon request, a copy of any of the foregoing materials. Any such request must be made in writing to us, c/o Investor Relations, Kopin Corporation, 125 North Drive, Westborough, MA, 01581.
