Item 1. Business
Our Company
 Ashford Inc. is a Maryland corporation that provides asset management services, advisory services and other products and services primarily to clients in the hospitality industry. We became a public company in November 2014, when Ashford Trust completed the spin-off of Ashford Inc. through the distribution of approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock to Ashford Trust stockholders and unitholders in Ashford Trust's operating partnership, collectively. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”). As of December 31, 2018, Ashford Trust held approximately 598,000 shares of our common stock, which represented an approximate 25.0% ownership interest in Ashford Inc., and Braemar held approximately 195,000 shares, which represented an approximate 8.1% ownership interest in Ashford Inc. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Monty J. Bennett, our chief executive officer and chairman and the chairman of Ashford Trust and Braemar, and his father, Mr. Archie Bennett, Jr., chairman emeritus of Ashford Trust, beneficially owned approximately 313,014 shares of our common stock, which represented an approximate 13.1% ownership interest in Ashford Inc., and beneficially owned 7,800,000 shares of our Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Convertible Preferred Stock”), which is exercisable (at an exercise price of $140 per share) into an additional approximate 1,392,857 shares of Ashford Inc. common stock, which if exercised as of December 31, 2018 would have increased Mr. Bennett and Mr. Bennett, Jr.’s ownership interest in Ashford Inc. to 45.1%.
We are currently the advisor for Ashford Trust and Braemar. In our capacity as the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for implementing the investment strategies and managing the day-to-day operations of Ashford Trust and Braemar, in each case subject to the supervision and oversight of the respective board of directors of Ashford Trust and Braemar. Ashford Trust commenced operating in August 2003 and is focused on investing in full service hotels in the upscale and upper-upscale segments in the U.S. that have revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) generally less than twice the national average. Braemar invests primarily in luxury hotels and resorts with RevPAR of at least twice the U.S. national average. Braemar became a publicly traded company in November 2013 upon the completion of its spin-off from Ashford Trust. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, and the common stock of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar is traded on the NYSE.
We provide the personnel and services that we believe are necessary for each of Ashford Trust and Braemar to conduct their respective businesses. We may also perform similar functions for new or additional platforms. We are not responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the individual hotel properties owned by either Ashford Trust or Braemar, which duties are, and will continue to be, the responsibility of the hotel management companies that operate the hotel properties owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar.
We conduct our advisory business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford LLC, our project management business through an operating entity, Premier, and our hospitality products and services business primarily through an operating entity, Ashford Services. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our business through Ashford LLC, Premier, and Ashford Services.
Our Business Strategy
Our principal business objective is to provide asset management, advisory and other products and services to other entities primarily in the hospitality industry. The Company seeks to grow in three primary areas: (i) expanding its existing REIT platforms accretively and accelerating performance to earn incentive fees; (ii) starting new REIT platforms for additional base and incentive fees; and (iii) acquiring, investing in or incubating strategic businesses that can achieve accelerated growth through doing business with our existing REIT platforms and by leveraging our deep knowledge and extensive relationships within the hospitality sector. 
We have two business segments: (i) REIT Advisory, which provides asset management and advisory services; and (ii) Hospitality Products and Services (“HPS”), which provides products and services to clients primarily in the hospitality industry. HPS includes (a) Premier, which provides comprehensive and cost-effective design, development, and project management services, (b) Presentation Technologies LLC (“J&S”), which provides audio visual event technology and creative communications solutions services, (c) OpenKey Inc. (“OpenKey”), a hospitality focused mobile key platform that provides a universal smartphone app for keyless entry into hotel guest rooms, (d) PRE Opco LLC (“Pure Wellness”), which provides hypoallergenic premium rooms in the hospitality industry, and (e) RED Hospitality & Leisure LLC (“RED”), a provider of watersports activities and other travel and transportation services. For 2018, Premier, OpenKey, Pure Wellness and RED operating segments do not individually meet the accounting criteria for separate disclosure as reportable segments. However, we have elected to disclose Premier and OpenKey as reportable segments. Accordingly, we have four reportable segments: 
5

REIT Advisory, Premier, J&S and OpenKey. We combine the operating results of Pure Wellness and RED into an “all other” category, which we refer to as “Corporate and Other.” As of December 31, 2018, there were no material intercompany revenues or expenses between our operating segments.
In our asset management and advisory business, we earn advisory fees from each company that we advise. The fees earned from each company that we advise include a base fee, payable in cash, on a monthly basis, for managing the respective day-to-day operations of the companies that we advise and the day-to-day operations of their respective subsidiaries, in each case in conformity with the respective investment guidelines of such entity. The base fee is determined as a percentage of each entity’s total market capitalization, subject to a minimum fee. We may also be entitled to receive an incentive fee, payable in cash or a combination of cash and stock, from each of Ashford Trust and Braemar based on their respective out-performance of their peers, as measured by the annual total stockholder return of such company compared to its peers. Incentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust’s and/or Braemar’s annual total stockholder return exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company’s respective peer group, subject to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Condition (the “FCCR Condition”), and is defined in the respective advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees, measured with respect to a particular year are paid over a three-year period, beginning with January 15 immediately following the year of measurement, and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition, which relates to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges for Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized advisory services revenues of $70.4 million and $19.0 million from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, of which $1.8 million and $678,000 respectively, were incentive fees. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we earned advisory services revenues of $55.2 million and $10.8 million from Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, of which $1.8 million and $1.3 million respectively, were incentive fees.
Separate from our advisory agreements, Lismore Capital LLC (“Lismore”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, provides debt placement services to our REIT clients. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Lismore Capital earned $6.1 million in debt placement fees. During the year ended December 31 2017, Lismore Capital earned $1.1 million in debt placement fees. 
In our hospitality products and services business, we provide products and services to clients primarily in the hospitality industry, including Ashford Trust and Braemar. Our hospitality products and services business generates revenue from customers in various forms depending on the particular product or service provided and the generally accepted market conditions for pricing such products or services. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned audio visual revenue of $81.2 million, project management revenue of $10.6 million, which covers the period from the closing of our acquisition of Premier on August 8, 2018 through December 31, 2018, OpenKey revenue of $999,000, and other revenue of $4.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we earned audio visual revenue of $9.2 million, OpenKey revenue of $327,000 and other revenue of $2.1 million, respectively.
Our Advisory Agreements 
We advise Ashford Trust and Braemar pursuant to our advisory agreements. The provisions of the two advisory agreements are substantially similar, except as otherwise described below. The following summary of the terms of our advisory agreements does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to a copy of the actual agreements, as amended, entered into with Ashford Trust or Braemar, which have been included as exhibits to other documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.
General. Pursuant to our advisory agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar, we provide, or obtain on their behalf, the personnel and services necessary for each of these entities to conduct its respective business, as they have no employees of their own. All of the officers of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar are our employees. We are not obligated to dedicate any of our employees exclusively to either Ashford Trust or Braemar, nor are we or our employees obligated to dedicate any specific portion of time to the business of either Ashford Trust or Braemar, except as necessary to perform the service required of us in our capacity as the advisor to such entities. The advisory agreements require us to manage the business affairs of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar in conformity with the policies and the guidelines that are approved and monitored by the boards of such entities. Additionally, we must refrain from taking any action that would (a) adversely affect the status of Ashford Trust or Braemar as a REIT, (b) subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act, (c) knowingly and intentionally violate any law, rule or regulation of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over us, (d) violate any of the rules or regulations of any exchange on which our securities are listed or (e) violate the charter, bylaws or resolutions of the board of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, all as in effect from time to time. So long as we are the advisor to Braemar, Braemar’s governing documents permit us to designate persons as candidates for election as director at any stockholder meeting of Braemar at which directors are to be elected. Such nominees may be our executive officers.
Our Duties as Advisor. Subject to the supervision of the respective boards of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering the day-to-day operations of Ashford 
6

Trust and Braemar, including all of the subsidiaries and joint ventures of such entities; (2) all services relating to the acquisition, disposition and financing of hotels; (3) performing asset management duties; (4) engaging and supervising, on behalf of such companies, third parties to provide various services including but not limited to overseeing development management, property management, and other professional services; and (5) performing corporate governance and other management functions, including financial, capital markets, treasury, financial reporting, internal audit, accounting, tax and risk management services, SEC and regulatory compliance, and retention of legal counsel, auditors and other professional advisors, as well as other duties and services outlined in the advisory agreements.
Any increase in the scope of duties or services to be provided by us must be jointly approved by us and either Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, and is subject to additional compensation as outlined in the advisory agreements.
We are the sole and exclusive provider of asset management, project management and other services offered by us, for each of Ashford Trust and Braemar. At any time that Ashford Trust or Braemar desires to engage a third party for the performance of services or delivery of products, we have the exclusive right to provide such service or product at market rates.
We also have the power to delegate all or any part of our rights and powers to manage and control the business and affairs of such companies to such officers, employees, affiliates, agents and representatives of ours or such company as we may deem appropriate. Any authority delegated by us to any other person is subject to the limitations on our rights and powers specifically set forth in the advisory agreement or the charter of such company.
We require our employees and officers who provide services to the companies we advise to comply with the codes and the policies of such companies.
ERFP Agreements
General. On June 26, 2018, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the “Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement”) with Ashford Trust. On January 15, 2019, the Company entered into the Enhanced Return Funding Program Agreement and Amendment No. 1 to the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement (the “Braemar ERFP Agreement” and, together with the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the “ERFP Agreements”) with Braemar. The independent members of the board of directors of each of the Company, Ashford Trust, and Braemar, with the assistance of separate and independent legal counsel, engaged to negotiate the ERFP Agreements on behalf of the Company, Ashford Trust, and Braemar, respectively. The ERFP Agreements replaced the “key money investments” previously contemplated by the respective advisory agreements with each of Ashford Trust and Braemar.
Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Ashford Trust in connection with Ashford Trust’s acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust 10% of the acquired hotel’s purchase price in exchange for furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”), which is subsequently leased by the Company to Ashford Trust rent-free. In connection with Ashford Trust’s acquisition of the Hilton Old Town Alexandria on June 29, 2018 and La Posada de Santa Fe on October 31, 2018, the Company was obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $11.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust properties, in each case subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. The $16.1 million total of FF&E was purchased by us and leased by us to Ashford Trust effective December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no remaining ERFP obligation to Ashford Trust with respect to hotels already purchased by Ashford Trust. 
In connection with Ashford Trust’s acquisitions of The Embassy Suites New York Midtown Manhattan on January 22, 2019 and the Hilton Santa Cruz/Scotts Valley on February 26, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Ashford Trust with approximately $19.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for a total obligation of $24.5 million in exchange for FF&E at Ashford Trust properties, subject to the terms of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement. After consideration of the $16.1 million ERFP obligations funded in 2018 and the $24.5 million ERFP obligations incurred in connection with Ashford Trust’s acquisitions in 2019, the Company has $9.4 million remaining of its initial $50 million ERFP funding commitment to Ashford Trust.
Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company agreed to provide $50 million to Braemar in connection with Braemar’s acquisition of hotels recommended by us, with the option to increase the funding commitment to up to $100 million upon mutual agreement by the parties. Under the Braemar ERFP Agreement, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar 10% of the acquired hotel’s purchase price in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, which is subsequently leased by the Company to Braemar rent-free. In connection with Braemar’s acquisition of The Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe on January 15, 2019, the Company is obligated to provide Braemar with approximately $10.3 million in exchange for FF&E at Braemar properties, subject to the terms of the Braemar ERFP Agreement. 
7

Ashford Trust and Braemar, respectively, must provide reasonable advance notice to the Company to request ERFP funds in accordance with the respective ERFP Agreement. Each respective ERFP Agreement requires that the Company acquire the related FF&E within two years of Ashford Trust or Braemar acquiring the hotel property. The Company recognizes the related depreciation tax deduction at the time such FF&E is purchased by the company and placed into service at Ashford Trust or Braemar properties. However, the timing of the FF&E being purchased and placed into service is subject to uncertainties outside of the Company’s control that could delay the realization of any tax benefit associated with the purchase of FF&E. See notes 11 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements. 
Conditions to Funding. The Company (and its operating company Ashford LLC) shall have no obligation to provide any enhanced return investment in the event that (i) Ashford Trust, Braemar or any of Ashford Trust’s or Braemar’s subsidiaries, as applicable, has materially breached any provision of the applicable advisory agreement (provided that Ashford Trust and Braemar shall be entitled to cure any such breach prior to the applicable date of required acquisition of FF&E), (ii) any event or condition has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur which would give rise to a right of termination in favor of the Company under the applicable advisory agreement or the applicable ERFP Agreement, (iii) there would exist, immediately after such proposed enhanced return investment, a Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as defined in the applicable ERFP Agreement), or (iv) (a) Ashford LLC’s Unrestricted Cash Balance (as defined below) is, after taking into account the cash amount anticipated to be required for the proposed enhanced return investment, less than fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) (the “Cash Threshold”) as of one week after the date that Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, respectively, requires that Ashford LLC commit to fund an enhanced return investment with respect to an Enhanced Return Hotel Asset (as defined in the applicable ERFP Agreement) or (b) Ashford LLC reasonably expects, in light of its then-anticipated contractual funding commitments (including amounts committed pursuant to the ERFP Agreements but not yet paid) and cash flows, to have an Unrestricted Cash Balance that is less than the Cash Threshold immediately after the expected date of closing of the purchase of the Enhanced Return Hotel Asset.
For purposes of each of the ERFP Agreements, “Unrestricted Cash Balance” means, unrestricted cash of Ashford LLC; provided, that any cash or working capital of the Company or its other subsidiaries, including without limitation, Ashford Services, shall be included in the calculation of “Unrestricted Cash Balance” if such funds have been contributed, transferred or loaned from Ashford LLC to Ashford Services or such other subsidiaries for the purpose of avoiding, hindering or delaying Ashford LLC’s obligations under the applicable ERFP Agreement (it being understood that good faith loans or advances to, or investments in, Ashford Services’ or such other subsidiaries’ existing business or new services or other businesses, or the provision of working capital to Ashford Services or such other subsidiaries generally consistent with Ashford Services’ or such other subsidiaries past practices, shall not be deemed to have been made for the purpose of avoiding, hindering or delaying Ashford LLC’s obligations under the applicable ERFP Agreement).
Repayment Events. With respect to any acquisition of FF&E by Ashford LLC pursuant to the applicable ERFP Agreement, if prior to the date that is two years after such acquisition, (i) Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, is subject to a Company Change of Control (as defined in the applicable advisory agreement) or (ii) Ashford Trust, Braemar or the Company terminates the applicable advisory agreement and Ashford Trust or Braemar is required to pay the Termination Fee thereunder (each of clauses (i) and (ii), a “Repayment Event”), Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, as applicable, shall pay to Ashford LLC an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of any enhanced return investments actually funded by Ashford LLC during such two-year period.
Disposition of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets. If Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, respectively, or their subsidiaries dispose of or cause to be disposed any Enhanced Return Hotel Asset or other real property with respect to which Ashford LLC owns FF&E, including by way of a foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure by a mortgage or mezzanine lender of Ashford Trust OP or Braemar OP, respectively, or their subsidiaries, Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, shall promptly identify, and Ashford LLC shall acquire in exchange for such FF&E, FF&E for use at another real property asset leased by the applicable taxable REIT subsidiary and with a fair market value equal to the value of such FF&E as established in connection with such disposition.
Term. The initial term of each ERFP Agreement is two (2) years (the “Initial Term”), which begins on June 26, 2018 in the case of Ashford Trust and January 19, 2019 in the case of Braemar, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms of the ERFP Agreement. At the end of the Initial Term, the ERFP Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (each such period a “Renewal Term”) unless either the Company or Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, provides written notice to the other at least sixty (60) days in advance of the expiration of the Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable, that such notifying party intends not to renew the ERFP Agreement. The ERFP Agreement may be terminated by the Company or Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, in the event such party has a right to terminate the advisory agreement or by the Company in the event that the Company is entitled to transfer cash owned by Ashford Trust but controlled by the Company to the termination fee escrow account under the applicable advisory agreement. The amendments to the applicable advisory agreement set forth in the ERFP Agreements shall continue in force notwithstanding any termination of the ERFP Agreements.

Relationship with Ashford Trust and Braemar. We advise both Ashford Trust and Braemar. We are also permitted to have other advisory clients, which may include other REITs operating in the real estate industry or having the same or substantially similar investment guidelines as Ashford Trust or Braemar. If either Ashford Trust or Braemar materially revises its initial investment guidelines without our express written consent, we are required only to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Braemar, Ashford Trust and other entities we advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any of our then existing obligations to such other entities. Braemar has agreed not to revise its initial investment guidelines to be directly competitive with Ashford Trust. Ashford Trust agrees, pursuant to the terms of the Ashford Trust advisory agreement, that it will revise its investment guidelines as necessary to avoid direct competition with (i) any entity or platform that Ashford Trust may create or spin-off in the future and (ii) any other entity advised by us, provided that in the case of clause (ii), we and Ashford Trust mutually agree to the terms of such revision of Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines. The advisory agreements give each of Ashford Trust and Braemar the right to equitable treatment with respect to other clients of ours, but the advisory agreements do not give any entity the right to preferential treatment, except as follows:

• | Any new individual investment opportunities that satisfy Ashford Trust’s investment guidelines will be presented to its board of directors, which has up to 10 business days to accept any such opportunity prior to it being available to Braemar or another business advised by us.


• | Any new individual investment opportunities that satisfy Braemar’s investment guidelines will be presented to its board of directors, which has up to 10 business days to accept any such opportunity prior to it being available to Ashford Trust or another business advised by us.

To minimize conflicts between Ashford Trust and Braemar, the advisory agreements require each such entity to designate an investment focus by targeted RevPAR, segments, markets and other factors or financial metrics. After consultation with us, such entity may modify or supplement its investment guidelines from time to time by giving written notice to us; however, if either Ashford Trust or Braemar materially changes its investment guidelines without our express written consent, we are required only to use our best judgment to allocate investment opportunities to Ashford Trust, Braemar and other entities we may advise, taking into account such factors as we deem relevant, in our discretion, subject to any then existing obligations we have to such other entities.
When determining whether an asset satisfies the investment guidelines of either Ashford Trust or Braemar, we must make a good faith determination of projected RevPAR, taking into account historical RevPAR as well as such additional considerations as conversions or reposition of assets, capital plans, brand changes and other factors that may reasonably be forecasted to raise RevPAR after stabilization of such initiative.
If Ashford Trust or Braemar elect to spin-off, carve-out, split-off or otherwise consummate a transfer of a division or subset of assets for the purpose of forming a joint venture, a newly created private platform or a new publicly traded company to hold such division or subset of assets constituting a distinct asset type and/or investment guidelines, Ashford Trust and Braemar have agreed that any such new entity will be advised by us pursuant to an advisory agreement containing substantially the same material terms set forth in our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable.
Limitations on Liability and Indemnification. The advisory agreements provide that we have no responsibility other than to render the services and take the actions described in the advisory agreements in good faith and with the exercise of due care and are not responsible for any action the board of directors of either Ashford Trust or Braemar takes in following or declining to follow any advice from us. The advisory agreements provide that we, and our officers, directors, managers, employees and members, will not be liable for any act or omission by us (or our officers, directors, managers, employees or members) performed in accordance with and pursuant to the advisory agreements, except by reason of acts constituting gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of our duties under the applicable advisory agreement.
Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless (including our partners, directors, officers, stockholders, managers, members, agents, employees and each other person or entity, if any, controlling us) to the full extent lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities of any nature whatsoever with respect to or arising from any acts or omission by us (including ordinary negligence) in our capacity as advisor, except with respect to losses, claims, damages or liabilities with respect to or arising out of our gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, or reckless disregard of our duties set forth in the applicable advisory agreement (for which we have indemnified Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable).
Term and Termination of our Advisory Agreement with Ashford Trust. The term of our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust is 10 years, commencing from the effective date of the amended advisory agreement on June 10, 2015. Our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust provides for automatic five-year renewal terms unless previously terminated as described below. Our advisory agreement with Ashford Trust may be terminated by Ashford Trust with 180 days’ written notice prior to the 
9

expiration of the then current term, on the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the independent directors of Ashford Trust, based upon a good faith finding that either (a) there has been unsatisfactory performance by us that is materially detrimental to Ashford Trust and the subsidiaries of Ashford Trust taken as a whole, or (b) the base fee and/or incentive fee (each as defined in the advisory agreements) is not fair based on the then-current market for such fees (and we do not offer to negotiate a lower fee that at least a majority of the independent directors determine is fair). If the reason for non-renewal specified by Ashford Trust in the termination notice is clause (b) in the preceding sentence, then we may, at our option, provide a notice of proposal to renegotiate the base fee and incentive fee not less than 150 days prior to the pending termination date. Thereupon, each party has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate in good faith to find a resolution on fees within 120 days following receipt by Ashford Trust of the renegotiation proposal. If a resolution is achieved between us and at least a majority of the independent directors of Ashford Trust, within the 120-day period, then the applicable advisory agreement will continue in full force and effect with modification only to the agreed upon base fee and/or incentive fee, as applicable.
If no resolution on fees is reached within the 120-day period, or if Ashford Trust terminates the advisory agreement by reason of clause (a) above, or terminates the advisory agreement upon a change in control of Ashford Trust, the advisory agreement will terminate and Ashford Trust will be required to pay us all fees and expense reimbursements due and owing through the date of termination as well as a termination fee equal to 1.1 times the greater of either:

• | 12 multiplied by our Net Earnings for the 12-month period preceding the termination date of our advisory agreement. For purposes of this calculation, “Net Earnings” is defined in the advisory agreement as (A) our reported Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the advisory agreement) attributable to the advisory agreement for the 12-month period preceding the termination of the advisory agreement (adjusted to assume the advisory agreement was in place for the full 12-month period if it otherwise was not), as reported in our earnings releases less (B) our pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the advisory agreement) assuming our advisory agreement was not in place during such period plus (C) all EBITDA (Net Income (per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)) plus interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) of ours and any of our affiliates and subsidiaries from providing any service or product to Ashford Trust, its operating partnership or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, exclusive of EBITDA directly resulting from the advisory agreement;


• | the earnings multiple (calculated as our total enterprise value divided by our adjusted EBITDA) for our common stock per the 12-month period preceding the termination date multiplied by our Net Earnings (as defined above) for the 12 months preceding the termination; or


• | the simple average of our earnings multiples for the three fiscal years preceding the termination (calculated as our total enterprise value divided by our adjusted EBITDA for such periods) multiplied by our Net Earnings (as defined above) for the 12 months preceding the termination;

plus, in either case, a gross-up amount for federal and state tax liability, based on an assumed combined tax rate of 40%. Any such termination fee will be payable on or before the termination date.
Ashford Trust may also terminate the advisory agreement with 60 days’ notice upon of a change of control of Ashford Trust, if the change of control transaction is conditioned upon the termination of the advisory agreement. In such a circumstance, Ashford Trust would be required to pay the accrued costs and termination fee described above.
Ashford Trust may also terminate the applicable advisory agreement at any time, including during the 10-year initial term, without the payment of a termination fee, upon customary events of default and our failure to cure during certain cure periods, such as our default in performance of material obligations, the filing of bankruptcy or a dissolution action and other events, as outlined in the advisory agreement.
Upon any termination of the advisory agreement, we are required to cooperate with and assist Ashford Trust in executing an orderly transition of the management of its assets to a new advisor, providing a full accounting of all accounts held in the name of or on behalf of Ashford Trust, returning any funds held on behalf of Ashford Trust (other than the termination fee escrow account, if applicable) and returning any and all of the books and records of Ashford Trust.
We may terminate the advisory agreement prior to the expiration of the then-current term with 180 days’ prior written notice. Additionally, we may terminate the advisory agreement if Ashford Trust defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant under the applicable advisory agreement; provided, however, before terminating the advisory agreement, we must give Ashford Trust written notice of the default and provide Ashford Trust with an opportunity to cure the default within 45 days, or if such default is not reasonably susceptible to cure within 45 days, such additional cure period as is reasonably necessary to cure the default (not to exceed 90 days) so long as such entity is diligently and in good faith pursuing such cure. In the event of a termination pursuant to the preceding sentence during the initial term, we will be 
10

entitled to the greater of our actual damages or the termination fee described above; in the event of a termination pursuant to the preceding sentence during a renewal term, we will be entitled to the termination fee described above.
The advisory agreement also provides that if: (i) we have funded, or are committed to provide, enhanced return funding investments equal to at least $40.0 million; and (ii) either (a) Ashford Trust enters a letter of intent or definitive agreement that upon consummation would constitute a change of control; (b) the Ashford Trust board recommends that Ashford Trust’s stockholders accept a third party tender offer that would, if consummated, result in a third party beneficially owning 35% or more of Ashford Trust’s voting stock; or (c) a third party otherwise becomes a beneficial owner of 35% or more of Ashford Trust voting stock, then we are entitled to transfer Ashford Trust cash to an escrow account in an amount sufficient to pay the termination fee and other amounts set forth in the advisory agreement.
Base Fees under our Advisory Agreement with Ashford Trust. Ashford Trust is required, on a monthly basis, to pay a fee (the “Base Fee”) in an amount equal to 1/12 of (i) the Base Fee Percentage (as defined below, but during 2018 equal to 0.70%) of the Total Market Capitalization (as defined below) of Ashford Trust for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined below), if any, on the last day of the prior month during which the advisory agreement was in effect; provided, however in no event shall the Base Fee for any month be less than the Trust Minimum Base Fee (as defined below). 
“Base Fee Percentage” shall mean the following per annum percentages, which vary based on the Total Market Capitalization (as adjusted annually for inflation beginning from January 1, 2015) calculation: 

For each quarter in which the Total Market Capitalization* is: | Base Fee Percentage will be: 
≤$6 billion | 0.70% 
> $6 billion and ≤ $10 billion | 0.70% on amounts up to $6 billion 0.60% on amounts exceeding $6 billion 
> $10 billion | 0.70% on amounts up to $6 billion 0.60% on amounts exceeding $6 billion, up to $10 billion 0.50% on amounts exceeding $10 billion

______________
*Total Market Capitalization thresholds are subject to an annual inflation adjustment on each January 1 beginning January 1, 2016, based on increases to CPI. 
The “Total Market Capitalization” of Ashford Trust for any period is calculated as:
(a)    to the extent Ashford Trust common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange for every day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the amount calculated as:

(i) | average of the volume-weighted average price per share of common stock for Ashford Trust for each trading day of the period (“Average VWAP”) multiplied by the average number of shares of common stock and common units outstanding during such applicable period, on a fully-diluted basis (assuming all common units and long term incentive partnership units in Ashford Trust OP that have achieved economic parity with common units in the applicable operating partnership have been converted into shares of common stock and including any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than Average VWAP), plus


(ii) | the average for the applicable period of the aggregate principal amount of the consolidated indebtedness of Ashford Trust (including its proportionate share of debt of any entity that is not consolidated but excluding its joint venture partners’ proportionate share of consolidated debt), plus


(iii) | the average for the applicable period of the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred equity of Ashford Trust (excluding any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than Average VWAP).

(b)    to the extent Ashford Trust common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange (due to any reason, including but not limited to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange or the occurrence of a change of control) for any day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the greater of: (i) the weighted average Gross Asset Value of all the Ashford Trust’s assets on each day during such period; or (ii) the Total Market Capitalization as calculated 
11

pursuant to paragraph (a) of this definition on the last day on which common stock was listed for trading on a national securities exchange, regardless of whether this day occurred during the applicable period.
“Gross Asset Value” shall mean, with respect to any of Ashford Trust’s assets as of any date, the undepreciated carrying value of all such assets including all cash and cash equivalents and capitalized leases and any FF&E leased to subsidiaries of Ashford Trust to facilitate the purchase of any Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Asset (as defined below) as reflected on the most recent balance sheet and accompanying footnotes of Ashford Trust filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP consistent with its performance of its duties under the advisory agreement without giving effect to any impairments plus the publicly disclosed purchase price (excluding any net working capital and transferred FF&E reserves) of any assets acquired after the date of the most recent balance sheet and all capital expenditures made (to the extent not already reflected in the carrying value of the asset) with respect to an asset since the date of its acquisition for any improvements or for additions thereto, that have a useful life of more than one year and that are required to be capitalized under GAAP.
“Net Asset Fee Adjustment” shall be equal to (i) the product of the Sold Non-ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of real property (other than any asset the purchase of which was funded in part by the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement (“Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Assets”)) sold or disposed of after the date of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 0.70% plus (ii) the product of the Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Ashford Trust Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the Ashford Trust ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 1.07%.
The “Trust Minimum Base Fee” for each month beginning January 1, 2016 is equal to the greater of:
(i)    90% of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior year; and
(ii)    1/12th of the “G&A ratio” for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by the Total Market Capitalization of Ashford Trust on the last balance sheet date included in Ashford Trust’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filing.
The “G&A ratio” is calculated as the simple average of the ratios of total general and administrative expenses, including any dead deal costs, less any non-cash expenses, paid in the applicable quarter by each member of a select peer group, divided by the total market capitalization of such peer group member. The peer group for Ashford Trust may be adjusted from time-to-time by mutual agreement between us and a majority of the independent directors of Ashford Trust.
Term and Termination of our Advisory Agreement with Braemar. The initial stated term of our advisory agreement with Braemar is 10 years and will expire, unless otherwise extended or earlier terminated, on January 24, 2027. Our advisory agreement with Braemar provides for seven successive additional ten-year renewal terms upon written notice to Braemar, given at least 210 days prior to the expiration of the then current term. The advisory agreement may be terminated by Braemar, with no termination fee due and payable, under the following circumstances: (i) upon our conviction (including a plea or nolo contendere) by a court of competent jurisdiction of a felony; (ii) if we commit an act of fraud against Braemar, convert the funds of Braemar or act in a manner constituting gross negligence in the performance of our material duties under the advisory agreement (including a failure to act); (iii) if we undergo a Bankruptcy Event (as defined by the advisory agreement); or (iv) upon the entry by a court of a final non-appealable order awarding monetary damages to Braemar based on a finding that we committed a material breach or default of a material term, condition, obligation or covenant of the advisory agreement, which breach or default had a material adverse effect.
Upon the closing of a change of control with respect to Braemar (as defined in the advisory agreement), either party may terminate the advisory agreement, and Braemar will be required to pay us all fees and expense reimbursements due and owing through the date of termination as well as a termination fee equal to the greater of:

• | (i) 12 multiplied by (ii) the sum of (A) our Net Earnings (as defined below) for the 12-month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter preceding the termination date of our advisory agreement (“LTM Period”) and (B) to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement;


• | (i) the quotient of (A) our total market capitalization (as defined in the advisory agreement) on the trading day immediately preceding the date of payment of the termination fee, divided by (B) our Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM Period (which for purposes of this paragraph shall include the EBITDA (adjusted on a comparable basis to our Adjusted EBITDA)) for the same LTM Period of any person that we acquired a beneficial ownership interest in during the applicable measurement period, in the same proportion as our beneficial ownership of the acquired person, multiplied by (ii) Net Earnings for the LTM Period plus, to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the

12

advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement; and

• | the simple average, for the three years preceding the fiscal year in which the termination fee is due, of (i) the quotient of (A) our total market capitalization on the trading day immediately preceding the date of payment of the termination fee, divided by (B) our Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM Period multiplied by (ii) Net Earnings for the LTM Period plus, to the extent not included in Net Earnings, any incentive fees under the advisory agreement that have accrued or are accelerated but have not yet been paid at the time of termination of the advisory agreement.

For purposes of this calculation, “Net Earnings” is generally defined in the advisory agreement as (A) the total base fees and incentive fees, plus any other revenues reported on our income statement as pertaining to the advisory agreement (in each case, in accordance with GAAP) including all EBITDA of us and our affiliates and of our subsidiaries from providing any additional services to Braemar and its affiliates, less (B) the total incremental expenses determined in accordance with the advisory agreement, in each case for the LTM Period (adjusted assuming (i) the agreement was in place for the full LTM Period if it otherwise was not and (ii) all contracts providing for fees owing to us by Braemar were in place for the full LTM Period if they otherwise were not and all fees payable under such contracts shall be annualized as such). In the event we acquire a beneficial ownership interest in a person that reported on its income statement revenues derived from Braemar, then the revenues received by such acquired person from Braemar for the full LTM Period shall be included within clause (A) of the definition of Net Earnings in the same proportion as our beneficial ownership of the acquired person.
Any such termination fee will be payable on or before the termination date. 
Upon any termination of the advisory agreement, we are required to cooperate with and assist Braemar in executing an orderly transition of the management of its assets to a new advisor, providing a full accounting of all accounts held in the name of or on behalf of such company, returning any funds held on behalf of such company and returning any and all of the books and records of such company. Braemar will be responsible for paying all accrued fees and expenses and will be subject to certain non-solicitation obligations with respect to our employees upon any termination of the applicable advisory agreement other than termination as a result of change of control of our company.
The advisory agreement also provides that if: (a) Braemar enters a letter of intent or definitive agreement that upon consummation would constitute a change of control; (b) the Braemar board recommends that Braemar’s stockholders accept a third party tender offer that would, if consummated, result in a third party beneficially owning 35% or more of Braemar’s voting stock; or (c) a third party otherwise becomes a beneficial owner of 35% or more of Braemar voting stock, then we are entitled to transfer Braemar cash to an escrow account in an amount sufficient to pay the termination fee and other amounts set forth in the advisory agreement.
Base Fees under our Advisory Agreement with Braemar. Braemar is required to pay, on a monthly basis, a fee (the “Base Fee”) in an amount equal to 1/12th of the sum of (i) 0.70% of the Total Market Capitalization (as defined below) of Braemar for the prior month, plus (ii) the Net Asset Fee Adjustment (as defined below), if any, on the last day of the prior month during which the advisory agreement was in effect; provided, however, in no event shall the Base Fee for any month be less than the Braemar Minimum Base Fee (as defined below). 
The “Total Market Capitalization” of Braemar for any period is calculated on a monthly basis as follows:
(a)    to the extent Braemar common stock is listed for trading on a national securities exchange for every day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the amount calculated as:

(i) | the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of common stock for Braemar for each trading day of the period (“Average VWAP”) multiplied by the average number of shares of common stock and common units outstanding during such applicable period, on a fully-diluted basis (assuming all common units and long term incentive partnership units in the applicable operating partnership which have achieved economic parity with common units in the applicable operating partnership have been converted into shares of common stock and including any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock where the conversion price is less than the Average VWAP), plus


(ii) | the average for the applicable period of the aggregate principal amount of the consolidated indebtedness of Braemar (including its proportionate share of debt of any entity that is not consolidated but excluding its joint venture partners’ proportionate share of consolidated debt), plus

13


(iii) | the average for the applicable period of the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred equity of Braemar (excluding any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of any convertible preferred stock of Braemar where the conversion price is less than the Average VWAP).

(b)     to the extent Braemar common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange (due to any reason, including but not limited to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange or the occurrence of a change of control) for any day during any period for which the Total Market Capitalization is to be calculated, the greater of: (i) the weighted average Gross Asset Value of all Braemar’s assets on each day during such period; or (ii) the Total Market Capitalization as calculated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this definition on the last day on which common stock was listed for trading on a national securities exchange, regardless of whether this day occurred during the applicable period.
“Gross Asset Value” shall mean, with respect to any of Braemar’s assets as of any date, the undepreciated carrying value of all such assets including all cash and cash equivalents and capitalized leases and any FF&E leased to subsidiaries of Braemar to facilitate the purchase of any Enhanced Return Hotel Asset as reflected on the most recent balance sheet and accompanying footnotes of Braemar filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or prepared by the Advisor in accordance with GAAP consistent with its performance of its duties under the advisory agreement without giving effect to any impairments plus the publicly disclosed purchase price (excluding any net working capital and transferred FF&E reserves) of any assets acquired after the date of the most recent balance sheet and all capital expenditures made (to the extent not already reflected in the carrying value of the asset) with respect to an asset since the date of its acquisition for any improvements or for additions thereto, that have a useful life of more than one year and that are required to be capitalized under GAAP.
“Net Asset Fee Adjustment” shall be equal to (i) the product of the Sold Non-ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of real property (other than any Enhanced Return Hotel Assets) sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 0.70% plus (ii) the product of the Sold ERFP Asset Amount (as more particularly defined in the advisory agreement, but generally equal to the net sales prices of Enhanced Return Hotel Assets sold or disposed of after the date of the ERFP Agreement, commencing with and including the first such sale) and 1.07%.
The “Braemar Minimum Base Fee” for each month will be equal to the greater of:
(i)    90% of the base fee paid for the same month in the prior year; and
(ii)    1/12th of the “G&A ratio” for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by the total market capitalization of Braemar on the last balance sheet date included in Braemar’s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K filing.
The “G&A ratio” is calculated as the simple average of the ratios of total general and administrative expenses, including any dead deal costs, less any non-cash expenses, paid in the applicable fiscal quarter by each member of a select peer group, divided by the total market capitalization of such peer group member. The peer group for each company may be adjusted from time-to-time by mutual agreement between us and a majority of the independent directors of Braemar. Each month’s base fee is determined based on prior month results and is payable in cash on the fifth business day of the month for which the fee is applied.
Incentive Fee under the Advisory Agreements with Ashford Trust and Braemar. Incentive advisory fees are measured annually in each year that Ashford Trust’s and/or Braemar’s annual total stockholder return (“TSR”) exceeds the average annual total stockholder return for each company’s respective peer group, subject to the FCCR Condition, as defined in the advisory agreements. Incentive advisory fees are paid over a three-year period and each payment is subject to the FCCR Condition. For purposes of this calculation, Ashford Trust’s TSR is calculated using a year-end stock price equal to the closing price of its common stock on the last trading day of the year as compared to the closing stock price of its common stock on the last trading day of the prior year, in each case assuming all dividends on the common stock during such period are reinvested into additional shares of common stock of Ashford Trust on the day such dividends are paid. Braemar’s TSR is calculated as the sum, expressed as a percentage, of: (A) the change in the Braemar common stock price during the applicable period; plus (B) the dividend yield paid during the applicable period (determined by dividing dividends paid during the applicable period by Braemar’s common stock price at the beginning of the applicable period and including the value of any dividends or distributions with respect to Braemar common stock not paid in cash valued in the reasonable discretion of Ashford LLC). The average TSR for each member of such company’s peer group is calculated in the same manner and for the same time period, and the simple average for the entire peer group is used.
The annual incentive fee is calculated as (i) 5% of the amount (expressed as a percentage but in no event greater than 25%) by which the annual TSR of Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, exceeds the average TSR for its respective peer group, multiplied by (ii) the fully diluted equity value of such company at December 31 of the applicable year. To determine the fully diluted equity value, we assume that all units in the operating partnership of Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, 
14

including Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) units that have achieved economic parity with the common units, if any, converted into common stock and that the per share value of each share of common stock of such company is equal to the closing price of its stock on the last trading day of the year. The incentive fee, if any, subject to the FCCR Condition, is payable in arrears in three equal annual installments with the first installment payable on January 15 following the applicable year for which the incentive fee relates and on January 15 of the next two successive years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any termination of the advisory agreement for any reason, any unpaid incentive fee (including any incentive fee as measured for the stub period ending on the termination date) will become fully earned and immediately due and payable without regard to the FCCR Condition. Except in the case when the incentive fee is payable on the date of termination of this Agreement, up to 50% of the incentive fee may be paid by each Ashford Trust or Braemar, at the option of such entity, in shares its common stock or common units of the applicable operating partnership of such entity, with the balance payable in cash, unless at the time for payment of the incentive fee:

(i) | we or our affiliates own common stock or common units in an amount (determined with reference to the closing price of the common stock of each Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, on the last trading day of the year) greater than or equal to three times the base fee for the preceding four quarters,


(ii) | payment in such securities would cause us to be subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, or


(iii) | payment in such securities would not be legally permissible for any reason; in which case, the entire Incentive Fee will be paid by Ashford Trust or Braemar in cash.

Upon the determination of the incentive fee, except in the case of any termination of the advisory agreement in which case the incentive fee for the stub period and all unpaid installments of an incentive fee shall be deemed earned by us and fully due and payable by Ashford Trust and Braemar, as applicable, each one-third installment of the incentive fee shall not be deemed earned by us or otherwise payable by Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, unless such entity, as of the December 31 immediately preceding the due date for the payment of the incentive fee installment, has met the FCCR Condition requiring an FCCR of 0.20x or greater. For purposes of this calculation, FCCR is the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters to fixed charges, which includes all (i) such entity and its subsidiaries’ interest expense, (ii) such entity and its subsidiaries’ regularly scheduled principal payments, other than balloon or similar principal payments which repay indebtedness in full and payments under cash flow mortgages applied to principal, and (iii) preferred dividends paid by such entity.
Equity Compensation. To incentivize our employees, officers, consultants, non-employee directors, affiliates and representatives to achieve the goals and business objectives of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar, as established by the boards of directors of such entities, in addition to the base fee and the incentive fee described above, the boards of directors of each of Ashford Trust and Braemar have the authority to make annual equity awards to us or directly to our employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors, based on achievement of certain financial and other hurdles established by such board of directors.
Expense Reimbursement. We are responsible for all wages, salaries, cash bonus payments and benefits related to our employees providing services to Ashford Trust or Braemar (including any of the officers of Ashford Trust or Braemar who are also officers or employees of our company), with the exception of any equity compensation that may be awarded by Ashford Trust or Braemar to our employees who provide services to Ashford Trust and Braemar, the provision of certain internal audit, asset management and risk management services and the international office expenses described below. Ashford Trust and Braemar are each responsible to pay or reimburse us monthly for all other costs we incur on behalf of such entities or in connection with the performance of our services and duties to such companies, including, without limitation, tax, legal, accounting, advisory, investment banking and other third-party professional fees, director fees, insurance (including errors and omissions insurance and any other insurance required pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreements), debt service, taxes, underwriting, brokerage, reporting, registration, listing fees and charges, travel and entertainment expenses, conference sponsorships, transaction diligence and closing costs, dead deal costs, dividends, office space, the cost of all equity awards or compensation plans established by such companies, including the value of awards made by companies to our employees, and any other costs which are reasonably necessary for the performance by us of our duties and functions, including any expenses incurred by us to comply with new or revised laws or governmental rules or regulations that impose additional duties on Ashford Trust or Braemar or us in our capacity as advisor to such entities. In addition, each of Ashford Trust and Braemar pays a pro rata share of our office overhead and administrative expenses incurred in the performance of our duties and functions under the advisory agreements. There is no specific limitation on the amount of such reimbursements.
In addition to the expenses described above, each of Ashford Trust and Braemar are required to reimburse us monthly for its pro rata share (as reasonably agreed to between us and a majority of the independent directors of such company or its audit committee, chairman of its audit committee or lead director) of all reasonable international office expenses, overhead, 
15

personnel costs, travel and other costs directly related to our non-executive personnel who are located internationally or that oversee the operations of international assets or related to our personnel that source, investigate or provide diligence services in connection with possible acquisitions or investments internationally. Such expenses include but are not limited to, salary, wages, payroll taxes and the cost of employee benefit plans. We also pay for the costs associated with Ashford Trust’s current chairman emeritus, which includes a $700,000 annual stipend and the cost of all benefits currently available to him, as well as reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection with his service to Ashford Trust. 
Additional Services. If, and to the extent that, either Ashford Trust or Braemar requests us to render services on behalf of such company other than those required to be rendered by us under the advisory agreement, including, but not limited to, certain services provided by Ashford Services, such additional services will be compensated separately, at market rates, as defined in the advisory agreements.
The Ashford Trademark. We have a proprietary interest in the “Ashford” trademark, and we agreed to license its use to each of Ashford Trust and Braemar. If at any time Ashford Trust or Braemar ceases to retain us to perform advisory services for them, within 60 days following receipt of written request from us, such entity must cease to conduct business under or use the “Ashford” name or logo, as well as change its name and the names of any of its subsidiaries to a name that does not contain the name “Ashford.”
Our Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington Lodging, Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust, and Master Project Management Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust
Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington Lodging
The Company and its operating company, Ashford LLC, had previously entered into a mutual exclusivity agreement with Remington Lodging, dated as of November 12, 2014, that was consented and agreed to by Monty J. Bennett. Monty J. Bennett, who is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and his father, Archie Bennett, Jr., beneficially own, directly or indirectly, 100% of Remington Lodging. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company had agreed to utilize Remington Lodging to provide all property management, development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management for all hotels, if any, that the Company acquired in the future, as well as all hotels that future companies that the Company advised acquired, to the extent that the Company had the right, or controlled the right, to direct such matters, subject to certain exceptions. In exchange for the Company’s agreement to engage Remington Lodging for such services, Remington Lodging had agreed to grant to the Company a right of first refusal to purchase, on behalf of itself or any companies advised by the Company, any investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that met the initial investment criteria of such entities, as identified in the advisory agreement between the Company and such entities, subject to any prior rights granted by Remington Lodging to other entities, including Ashford Trust and Braemar.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Premier, formerly the project management business of Remington Lodging, the Company, Ashford LLC and Remington Lodging entered into the Ashford Inc. Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018. Under the Ashford Inc. Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, the Company agrees to use Remington Lodging to provide only property management services (and not development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management) for all hotels, if any, that the Company may acquire in the future, as well as all hotels that future companies that the Company advises may acquire, to the extent that the Company has the right, or controls the right, to direct such matters, subject to certain exceptions. The Ashford Inc. Mutual Exclusivity Agreement provides for an initial term until November 12, 2024, with five automatic extensions of ten years provided that at the time of any such extension an event of default does not exist. The Company is not required to utilize Remington Lodging to provide such services, however, if the Company’s independent directors either (i) unanimously vote not to utilize Remington Lodging for such services or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Remington because the Company’s independent directors determine that it would be in the Company’s best interest not to engage Remington Lodging or that another company could perform the duties materially better. In connection with the acquisition of Premier, Remington Lodging and its affiliates assigned their rights under the mutual exclusivity agreement with respect to development and construction, capital improvements, refurbishment, project management and other services such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, to Premier.
Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement
Remington Lodging had previously entered into a Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated August 29, 2003 (the “Ashford Trust Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement”) with Ashford Trust and Ashford Trust OP. Under the Ashford Trust Original Exclusivity Agreement, Remington Lodging gave Ashford Trust a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that met Ashford Trust’s initial investment criteria, and 
16

Ashford Trust agreed to engage Remington Lodging to provide property management, development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Ashford Trust acquired or invested in, to the extent that Ashford Trust had the right or controlled the right to direct such matters, subject to certain conditions.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Premier, the parties divided the Ashford Trust Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement into: (i) an agreement among Ashford Trust, Ashford Trust OP and Remington Lodging with respect to the provision of property management services to Ashford Trust (which was effectuated by amending and restating the Ashford Trust Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement to require Ashford Trust to engage Remington Lodging only with respect to property management services); and (ii) an agreement among Ashford Trust, Ashford Trust OP and Premier with respect to the provisions of development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, solely in order to effect the transfer of the project management business to Premier. As a result, concurrently with the acquisition of Premier, Ashford Trust, Ashford Trust OP and Premier entered into the Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 (the “Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, Premier has given Ashford Trust a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Premier and any of its affiliates that meet Ashford Trust’s initial investment criteria, and Ashford Trust has agreed to engage Premier to provide development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Ashford Trust acquires or invests in, to the extent that Ashford Trust has the right or controls the right to direct such matters, unless Ashford Trust’s independent directors either: (i) unanimously vote not to hire Premier; or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Premier because they had determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would not be in Ashford Trust’s best interest to engage Premier or that another manager or developer could perform the project management or development duties materially better.
The Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement provides for a term ending August 29, 2020, including extensions exercised to date. The term will be automatically extended for two successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time of any such extension an event of default under the Ashford Trust Mutual Exclusivity Agreement does not exist.
Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement
Remington Lodging had previously entered into hotel master management agreements (collectively, the “Ashford Trust Original Master Management Agreement”) with Ashford TRS Corporation, a subsidiary of Ashford Trust OP, and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Ashford Trust TRS”), pursuant to which Remington Lodging provided Ashford Trust TRS both property management services and project management services with respect to hotels owned or leased by Ashford Trust TRS.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Premier, the parties divided the Ashford Trust Original Master Management Agreement into (i) an agreement between Ashford Trust and Remington Lodging with respect to the provision of property management services to Ashford Trust TRS (which was effectuated by consolidating, amending and restating the Ashford Trust Original Master Management Agreement to provide only property management services) and (ii) an agreement among Ashford Trust TRS, Ashford Trust OP and Premier with respect to the provision of project management services, solely in order to effect the transfer of the project management business to Premier. As a result, concurrently with the acquisition of Premier, Ashford Trust TRS, Ashford Trust OP and Premier entered into a Master Project Management Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 (the “Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement, Ashford Trust TRS has appointed Premier as its sole, exclusive and continuing manager to manage, coordinate, plan and execute the capital improvement budget and all major repositionings of hotels owned or leased by Ashford Trust TRS (“Ashford Trust Hotels”) and to provide construction management, interior design, architectural, FF&E purchasing, FF&E expediting/freight management, FF&E warehousing, and FF&E installation and supervision services (“Project Services”).
The Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall be paid a project management fee equal to four percent of the total project costs associated with the implementation of the capital improvement budget (both hard and soft) payable monthly in arrears based upon the prior calendar month’s total expenditures under the capital improvement budget until such time that the capital improvement budget and/or renovation project involves the expenditure of an amount in excess of five percent of the gross revenues of the applicable Ashford Trust Hotel, whereupon the project management fee shall be reduced to three percent of the total project costs in excess of the five percent of gross revenue threshold. In addition, the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall be paid additional fees at current market rates (“Market Service Fees”) for the Project Services, unless a majority of the independent directors of Ashford Trust affirmatively 
17

vote that such the Market Service Fees proposed by Premier are not market (in which case a consultant will be engaged to determine the Market Service Fees).
The Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Premier, at its option, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Premier is not then in default under the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement. In certain cases of early termination of the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Ashford Trust must pay Premier termination fees as described in the Ashford Trust Project Management Agreement, plus any amounts otherwise due to Premier.
Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement 
Remington Lodging had previously entered into a Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated November 19, 2013 (the “Braemar Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement”) with Braemar and Braemar OP. Under the Braemar Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, Remington Lodging gave Braemar a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Remington Lodging and any of its affiliates that met Braemar’s initial investment criteria, and Braemar agreed to engage Remington Lodging to provide property management, development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Braemar acquired or invested in, to the extent that Braemar had the right or controlled the right to direct such matters, subject to certain conditions.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Premier, the parties divided the Braemar Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement into: (i) an agreement among Braemar, Braemar OP and Remington Lodging with respect to the provision of property management services to Braemar (which was effectuated by amending and restating the Braemar Original Mutual Exclusivity Agreement to require Braemar to engage Remington Lodging only with respect to property management services); and (ii) an agreement among Braemar, Braemar OP and Premier with respect to the provision of development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, to Braemar, solely in order to effect the transfer of the project management business to Premier. As a result, concurrently with the acquisition of Premier, Braemar, Braemar OP and Premier entered into the Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 (the “Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement”).
Pursuant to the Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement, Premier has given Braemar a first right of refusal to purchase any lodging-related investments identified by Premier and any of its affiliates that meet Braemar’s initial investment criteria, and Braemar has agreed to engage Premier to provide development and construction, capital improvement, refurbishment, project management and other services, such as purchasing, interior design, freight management, and construction management, for hotels Braemar acquires or invests in, to the extent that Braemar has the right or controls the right to direct such matters, unless Braemar’s independent directors either: (i) unanimously vote not to hire Premier; or (ii) based on special circumstances or past performance, by a majority vote elect not to engage Premier because they had determined, in their reasonable business judgment, that it would not be in Braemar’s best interest to engage Premier or that another manager or developer could perform the project management or development duties materially better.
The Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement provides for an initial term until November 19, 2023. The initial term will be automatically extended for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time of any such extension an event of default under the Braemar Mutual Exclusivity Agreement does not exist.
Braemar Project Management Agreement
Remington Lodging had previously entered into a Hotel Master Management Agreement dated November 19, 2013 (the “Braemar Original Master Management Agreement”) with Braemar TRS Corporation, a subsidiary of Braemar OP (“Braemar TRS”), pursuant to which Remington Lodging provided Braemar TRS both property management services and project management services with respect to hotels owned or leased by Braemar TRS.
In connection with the Company’s acquisition of Premier, the parties divided the Braemar Original Master Management Agreement into: (i) an agreement between Braemar and Remington Lodging with respect to the provision of property management services to Braemar TRS (which was effectuated by amending and restating the Braemar Original Master Management Agreement to provide only property management services); and (ii) an agreement among Braemar TRS, Braemar OP and Premier with respect to the provision of project management services to Braemar TRS, solely in order to effect the transfer of the project management business to Premier. As a result, concurrently with the acquisition of Premier, Braemar TRS, Braemar OP and Premier entered into the Braemar Master Project Management Agreement dated as of August 8, 2018 (the “Braemar Project Management Agreement”).
18

Pursuant to the Braemar Project Management Agreement, Braemar TRS has appointed Premier as its sole, exclusive and continuing manager to manage, coordinate, plan and execute the capital improvement budget and all major repositionings of hotels owned or managed by Braemar TRS (“Braemar Hotels”) and to provide Project Services.
The Braemar Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall be paid a project management fee equal to four percent of the total project costs associated with the implementation of the capital improvement budget (both hard and soft) payable monthly in arrears based upon the prior calendar month’s total expenditures under the capital improvement budget until such time that the capital improvement budget and/or renovation project involves the expenditure of an amount in excess of five percent of the gross revenues of the applicable Braemar Hotel, whereupon the project management fee shall be reduced to three percent of the total project costs in excess of the five percent of gross revenue threshold. In addition, the Braemar Project Management Agreement provides that Premier shall also provide to Braemar Hotels the following services and shall be paid the following fees: (i) architectural (6.5% of total construction costs); (ii) construction management for projects without a general contractor (10% of total construction costs); (iii) interior design (6% of the purchase price of the FF&E designed or selected by Premier); and (iv) FF&E purchasing (8% of the purchase price of FF&E purchased by Premier; provided that if the purchase price exceeds $2.0 million for a single hotel in a calendar year, then the purchasing fee is reduced to 6% of the FF&E purchase price in excess of $2.0 million for such hotel in such calendar year).
The Braemar Project Management Agreement provides for an initial term of 10 years as to each hotel governed by the agreement. The term may be renewed by Premier, at its option, for three successive periods of seven years each and, thereafter, a final term of four years, provided that at the time the option to renew is exercised, Premier is not then in default under the Braemar Project Management Agreement. In certain cases of early termination of the Braemar Project Management Agreement with respect to one or more of the hotels, Braemar must pay Premier termination fees as described in the Braemar Project Management Agreement, plus any amounts otherwise due to Premier.
The foregoing descriptions of the Amended and Restated Mutual Exclusivity Agreement with Remington Lodging, Mutual Exclusivity Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust, and Master Project Management Agreements with Braemar and Ashford Trust are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements, which have been included as exhibits to other documents filed with the SEC and are incorporated by reference to this Form 10-K. 
Regulation 
General. The Company, Ashford Trust, and Braemar, as applicable, are subject, in certain circumstances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things regulate public disclosures, reporting obligations and capital raising activity. As an advisor to companies that own hotel properties, the operations and properties of such entities are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements.
REIT Regulations. Each of Ashford Trust and Braemar has elected and is qualified and expects to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. As REITs, such companies must currently distribute, at a minimum, an amount equal to 90% of their taxable income. In addition, such companies must distribute 100% of taxable income to avoid paying corporate federal income taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT status. These requirements include specific share ownership tests and assets and gross income composition tests. If either Ashford Trust or Braemar fails to continue to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it is subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if such companies continue to qualify for taxation as REITs, they may be subject to state and local income taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on their undistributed income. Under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, enacted on December 18, 2015, several Internal Revenue Code provisions relating to REITs and their stockholders were revised. These new rules were enacted with varying effective dates, some of which were retroactive.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we revalued our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017, using the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate. In addition, the TCJA repealed the provisions that provided for carryback of losses generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017, and we increased our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017, because we cannot consider tax paid in prior years as a source of taxable income to support realization of a portion of our net deferred tax assets. 
Americans with Disabilities Act. As the advisor to Ashford Trust and Braemar, we are responsible for ensuring that the hotels owned by such entities comply with applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or “ADA,” to the extent that such hotels are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations 
19

is an ongoing one, and we continue to assess the hotels and to advise Ashford Trust or Braemar, as applicable, to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Affordable Care Act. We could be subject to penalties under the employer mandate provisions of the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) if we did not offer affordable, minimum value health care coverage to substantially all of our full-time equivalent employees and their dependents. Any such penalty would be based on the number of full-time employees. We do not anticipate being subject to a penalty under the ACA; however, even in the event that we are, any such penalty would be less than approximately $970,000 based on our number of full-time employees. As of December 31, 2018, we had 116 full-time domestic corporate employees and approximately 700 employees at our consolidated subsidiaries that provide products and services to the lodging industry.
Environmental Matters. Under various laws relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator (including tenants) of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. These costs could be substantial and liability under these laws may attach without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar may expose such entities, and potentially us, to third-party liability or materially and adversely affect the ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to incur debt using the real estate as collateral.
The hotels owned by Ashford Trust and Braemar are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that address a wide variety of issues, including, but not limited to, storage tanks, air emissions from emergency generators, storm water and wastewater discharges, lead-based paint, mold and mildew and waste management. These hotels incur costs to comply with these laws and regulations, and we or the property owners could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance.
Some of these hotels may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other adverse conditions, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation. The presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar could require a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected hotel or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from guests or employees at the hotels and others if property damage or health concerns arise.
In the judgment of management, while we may incur significant expense complying with the various regulation to which we are subject, existing statutes and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to forecast the nature of future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
Distributions and Our Distribution Policy
Evaluation of our distribution policy and the decision to make a distribution is made solely at the discretion of our board of directors and is based on factors including, but not limited to, our ability to generate income, availability of existing cash balances, the performance of our business, capital requirements, applicable law, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.
Future distribution levels are subject to adjustment based upon any one or more of the factors set forth above, the matters discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other document we file with the SEC under the Exchange Act and other factors that our board of directors may, from time to time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate distribution. Our board of directors may also determine not to make any distribution.
Competition
The asset management industry is highly competitive. We compete on an industry, regional and niche basis based on a number of factors, including ability to raise capital, investment opportunities and performance, transaction execution skills, access to and retention of qualified personnel, reputation, range of products, innovation and fees for our services. Our clients compete with many third parties engaged in the hotel industry, including other hotel operating companies, ownership companies (including hotel REITs) and national and international hotel brands. Some of these competitors, including other REITs and private real estate companies and funds may have substantially greater financial and operational resources than Ashford Trust or Braemar and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest. Such competitors may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating 
20

efficiencies. Future competition from new market entrants may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to Ashford Trust and Braemar. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a more narrow margin over the borrowing cost for Ashford Trust and Braemar, making it more difficult to originate or acquire new investments on attractive terms. Certain competitors may also be subject to different regulatory regimes or rules that may provide them more flexibility or better access to pursue potential investments and raise capital for their managed companies. In addition, certain competitors may have higher risk tolerance, different risk assessment or a lower return threshold, which could allow them to consider a broader range of investments and to bid more aggressively for investment opportunities that we may want to pursue.
Ashford Trust and Braemar each compete with many third parties engaged in the hotel industry. Competition in the hotel industry is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services, guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which properties are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels. We believe that hotels that are affiliated with leading national brands, such as the Marriott or Hilton brands, will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with operating under such brands. Increased competition could have a material adverse effect on the occupancy rate, average daily room rate and RevPAR of the hotels owned by Ashford Trust or Braemar or may require capital improvements that otherwise would not have to be made, which may result in decreases in the profitability of Ashford Trust or Braemar and decreased advisory fees to us. Since the fees we receive are based in part upon total equity market capitalization and total shareholder returns, such fees are impacted by relative performance of the share price of Ashford Trust and Braemar compared to competitive REITs.
Insurance
We are required under our advisory agreements to maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and other insurance coverage in amounts which are carried by managers performing functions similar to those we provide.
Shareholder Rights Plan 
On August 8, 2018, we adopted a shareholder rights plan by entering into a Rights Agreement, dated August 8, 2018, with ComputerShare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent (the “Rights Agreement”). The terms of this plan are consistent with the terms of an earlier shareholder right plan originally adopted on November 16, 2014. Our stockholders voted at the 2018 annual meeting to extend the terms of that plan until February 25, 2021. 
We intend for the shareholder rights plan to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding shares of common stock. Our board of directors implemented the rights plan by declaring a dividend of one preferred share purchase right that was paid on August 20, 2018, for each outstanding share of our common stock on August 20, 2018, to our stockholders of record on that date. Each of those rights becomes exercisable on the Distribution Date (defined below) and entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share of our Series C Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price of $275 per one one-thousandth of a share of our Series C Preferred Stock represented by such a right, subject to adjustment.
Initially, the rights will be attached to all certificates representing our common stock, and no separate certificates evidencing the rights will be issued. The Rights Agreement provides that, until the date on which the rights separate and begin trading separately from our common stock (which we refer to as the “Distribution Date”), the rights will be transferred only with the shares of our common stock. The Distribution Date will occur, and the rights would separate and begin trading separately from the shares of our common stock, and certificates representing the rights will be issued to evidence the rights, on the earlier to occur of:

(i) | 10 business days following a public announcement, or the public disclosure of facts indicating, that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired beneficial ownership (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock, (referred to, subject to certain exceptions as “Acquiring Persons”) (or, in the event an exchange of the rights for shares of our common stock is effected in accordance with certain provisions of the Rights Agreement and our board of directors determines that a later date is advisable, then such later date that is not more than 20 days after such public announcement); or


(ii) | 10 business days (or such later date as may be determined by action of our board of directors prior to such time as any person becomes an Acquiring Person) of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock following the commencement of, or announcement of an intention to make, a tender offer or exchange offer the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock.

21

The rights also become exercisable if a person or group that already beneficially owns 10% or more of our common stock acquires any additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors, except that the Distribution Date will not occur as a result of our company, one of our subsidiaries, one of our employee benefit plans or a trustee for one of those plans, or Mr. Monty J. Bennett and certain of his affiliates and associates (so long as they own 20% or less of our outstanding common stock), acquiring additional shares of our common stock, and those persons will not be Acquiring Persons.
If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person at any time, with certain limited exceptions, the rights will become exercisable for shares of our common stock (or, in certain circumstances, shares of our Series C Preferred Stock or other of our securities that are similar) having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right. From and after the announcement that any person has become an Acquiring Person, if certificated rights are or were at any time on or after the earlier of (i) the date of such announcement or (ii) the Distribution Date acquired or beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person or an associate or affiliate of an Acquiring Person, such rights shall become void, and any holder of such rights shall thereafter have no right to exercise such rights. In addition, if, at any time after a person becomes an Acquiring Person, (i) we consolidate with, or merge with and into, any other person; (ii) any person consolidates with us, or merges with and into us and we are the continuing or surviving corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the shares of our common stock are or will be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person (or of ours) or cash or any other property; or (iii) 50% or more of our consolidated assets or earning power (as defined in the Rights Agreement) are sold, then proper provision will be made so that each holder of a right will thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise of a right at the then current exercise price of the right, that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction will have a market value of two times the exercise price of the right. Upon the occurrence of an event of the type described in this paragraph, if our board of directors so elects, we will deliver upon payment of the exercise price of a right an amount of cash or securities equivalent in value to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of a right. If we fail to meet that obligation within 30 days following of the announcement that a person has become an Acquiring Person, we must deliver, upon exercise of a right but without requiring payment of the exercise price then in effect, shares of our common stock (to the extent available) and cash equal in value to the difference between the value of the shares of our common stock otherwise issuable upon the exercise of a right and the exercise price then in effect.
Employees
At December 31, 2018, Ashford LLC had 116 corporate employees who directly or indirectly perform various acquisition, development, asset and investment management, capital markets, accounting, tax, risk management, legal, redevelopment, and corporate management functions for Ashford Inc., Ashford Trust and Braemar. Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have a total of approximately 700 employees as of December 31, 2018, who provide hospitality products and services to the lodging industry, including project management, audio visual and other services.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”), and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.” These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act.
We will cease to be an emerging growth company on December 31, 2019. We would also cease to be an emerging growth company and, therefore, become ineligible to rely on the above exemptions prior to December 31, 2019, if we:

• | issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period; or


• | become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, which would occur after: (i) we have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Exchange Act; (ii) we have been an SEC-reporting company for at least 12 months; and (iii) the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
