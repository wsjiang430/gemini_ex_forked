ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we use the terms the “Company,” “Clipper Realty,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Clipper Realty Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."
 
Overview
 
Clipper Realty Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company that acquires, owns, manages, operates and repositions multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area, with a portfolio in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Company was formed to continue and expand the commercial real estate business of the 50/53 JV LLC (a Delaware limited liability company), Renaissance Equity Holdings LLC (a Delaware limited liability company), Berkshire Equity LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) and Gunki Holdings LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) (collectively, the “Predecessor” or the “predecessor entities”). Our primary focus is to continue to own, manage and operate our portfolio, and to acquire and re-position additional multifamily residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area.
 
We were incorporated on July 7, 2015. On August 3, 2015, we closed a private offering of shares of our common stock, in which we raised net proceeds of approximately $130.2 million. In connection with the private offering, we consummated a series of investment and other formation transactions that were designed, among other things, to enable us to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015.
 
On February 9, 2017, the Company priced an initial public offering of 6,390,149 primary shares of its common stock (including the exercise of the over-allotment option, which closed on March 10, 2017) at a price of $13.50 per share (the “IPO”). The net proceeds of the IPO were approximately $78.7 million. We contributed the proceeds of the IPO to Clipper Realty L.P., our operating partnership subsidiary (the “Operating Partnership”), in exchange for units in the Operating Partnership.
 
On May 9, 2017, the Company completed the purchase of 107 Columbia Heights, a 161-unit apartment community located in Brooklyn Heights, New York, in vacant condition, for $87.5 million, financed with a $59.0 million secured mortgage loan. The Company also entered into a construction loan secured by the building that will provide up to $14.7 million for eligible capital improvements and carrying costs.
 
On October 27, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of an 82-unit residential property at 10 West 65th Street in Manhattan, New York, for $79.0 million, financed with a $34.4 million secured mortgage loan.
 
As of December 31, 2018, the properties owned by the Company consist of the following (collectively, the “Properties”):
 

• | Tribeca House in Manhattan, comprising two buildings, one with 21 stories and one with 12 stories, containing residential and retail space with an aggregate of approximately 483,000 square feet of residential rental Gross Leasable Area (“GLA”) and 77,000 square feet of retail rental and parking GLA;

These properties are located in the most densely populated major city in the United States, each with immediate access to mass transportation.
 
The Company’s ownership interest in its initial portfolio of properties (Tribeca House, Flatbush Gardens, 141 Livingston Street and 250 Livingston Street) was acquired in the formation transactions in connection with the private offering.  These properties are owned by the predecessor entities, which after the formation transactions are referred to as the “LLC subsidiaries.” The LLC subsidiaries are managed by the Company through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership’s interests in the LLC subsidiaries generally entitle the Operating Partnership to all cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the LLC subsidiaries, other than the preferred distribution to the continuing investors who hold Class B LLC units in these LLC subsidiaries (described below). In connection with the formation transactions, holders of interests in the predecessor entities received Class B LLC units in the Operating Partnership or shares of our common stock.  At December 31, 2018, the continuing investors owned an aggregate amount of 26,317,396 Class B LLC units, representing 59.6% of the Company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, the Operating Partnership’s interests in the LLC subsidiaries entitle it to receive 40.4% of the aggregate distributions from the LLC subsidiaries.
 
The Tribeca House properties were purchased in December 2014 and consist of two nearly adjacent properties in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. They comprise approximately 483,000 square feet of leasable residential area, with 506 apartment units, 11-foot ceilings and extensive amenities, and approximately 77,000 square feet of retail space, including an externally managed garage.
 
The Flatbush Gardens property complex was purchased in September 2005 and consists of 59 primarily six-story buildings, approximately 1.7 million leasable residential square feet and 2,496 apartment units, in East Flatbush, Brooklyn. The property is subject to rent control regulations of New York City. Since acquisition, the management team has undertaken a comprehensive renovation and repositioning strategy that has included upgrades to both the exteriors and the interiors of the buildings.
 
The 141 Livingston Street property in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood was purchased in 2002, along with the below-mentioned 250 Livingston Street property. It is a 15-story office building with approximately 206,000 square feet gross leasable area of commercial space. The property’s primary commercial tenant, the City of New York, executed a new 10-year lease in December 2015. Under the agreement, the City of New York has an option to terminate the lease after five years; if it decides to continue to occupy the building at such time, the annual rent will increase by 25% beginning the sixth year of the lease.
 
The 250 Livingston Street property in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood was purchased in 2002 (along with the 141 Livingston Street property), and consists of a 12-story office and residential building. It has approximately 294,000 square feet gross leasable area of commercial space and approximately 27,000 square feet of residential space. The property’s sole office tenant, the City of New York, has its two leases expiring in August 2020. The Company is in active discussions with the City regarding renewal of its leases. The office space has been remeasured to approximately 353,000 square feet, according to Real Estate Board of New York (“REBNY”) standards.
 
The Aspen property, purchased in June 2016, is located at 1955 1st Avenue in Manhattan, New York. It is a seven-story building that consists of approximately 187,000 square feet, 232 residential rental units, three retail units and a parking garage. The residential units are subject to regulations established by the New York City Housing Development Corporation (the “HDC”), under which there are no rental restrictions on approximately 55% of the property’s units, and low- and middle-income rental restrictions on approximately 45% of the units.
 
The 107 Columbia Heights property, purchased in May 2017 in vacant condition, is located in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. The property consists of approximately 102,000 square feet of residential space. Renovations are almost complete to create 158 well-appointed studio, one- and two-bedroom units, with amenities and indoor parking for 68 cars.

The 10 West 65th Street property, purchased in October 2017, is located in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, less than a block from Central Park. The property consists of approximately 76,000 square feet of leasable residential area, with 82 apartment units, plus an additional 53,000 square feet of air rights. Touro College, which had leased 40 apartment units in accordance with an agreement entered into when the Company purchased the property, exercised its option to terminate the leases, effective January 31, 2019. The Company is in the process of repositioning the apartments and expects to lease them at market rates.
 
History
 
The Company’s Predecessor is a combination of four limited liability companies - Renaissance Equity Holdings LLC, Berkshire Equity LLC, Gunki Holdings LLC and 50/53 JV LLC - which were formed by principals of our management team from 2002 to 2014. Upon completion of the private offering and the formation transactions, we assumed responsibility for managing the predecessor LLCs.
Business and Growth Strategies
 
Our primary business objective is to enhance stockholder value by increasing cash flow from operations and total return to stockholders through the following strategies:
 

● | Increase existing below-market rents – capitalize on the successful repositioning of our portfolio and solid market fundamentals to increase rents at several of our properties.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Disciplined acquisition strategy – opportunistically acquire additional properties, with a focus on premier submarkets and assets, by utilizing the significant experience of our senior management team.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proactive asset and property management – utilize our proactive, service-intensive approach to help increase occupancy and rental rates, and manage operating expenses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reposition assets – execute on our targeted capital program to selectively reposition properties and achieve rent growth in an expedited fashion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that the following competitive strengths distinguish us from other owners and operators of multifamily residential and commercial properties:
 

● | Diverse portfolio of properties in the New York metropolitan area, which is characterized by supply constraints, high barriers to entry, near- and long-term prospects for job creation, vacancy absorption and long-term rental rate growth.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expertise in repositioning and managing multifamily residential properties.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experienced management team with a proven track record over generations in New York real estate.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Balance sheet well-positioned for future growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Strong internal rent growth prospects.
--+---------------------------------------

Regulation
 
Environmental and Related Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner and operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances (such as lead, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls), waste, petroleum products and other miscellaneous products (including but not limited to natural products such as methane and radon gas) at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage.

In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. We are not presently aware of any material liabilities related to building conditions, including any instances of material noncompliance with asbestos requirements or any material liabilities related to asbestos.
 
In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage, or costs for remediation. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.
 
Americans with Disabilities Act and Similar Laws
 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. We have not conducted a recent audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with these or other federal, state or local laws. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Insurance
 
We carry commercial general liability insurance coverage on our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct and indirect physical damage to our properties including coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock. Our policies also cover the loss of rental revenue during any reconstruction period. Our policies reflect limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the buildings and portfolio. We also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to our real properties. We currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our properties, these policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, there are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from known environmental conditions or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. In addition, for properties we may self-insure certain portions of our insurance program, and therefore, use our own funds to satisfy those limits, when applicable. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured.
Competition
 
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the greater New York metropolitan market in which we operate. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial and residential real estate, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The principal means of competition are rents charged, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased.
 
In addition, we face competition from numerous developers, real estate companies and other owners and operators of real estate for buildings for acquisition and pursuing buyers for dispositions. We expect competition from other real estate investors, including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in transactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue.
