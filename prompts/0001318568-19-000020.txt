Item 1.  Business. 
Overview 
Everi is a leading supplier of technology solutions for the casino gaming industry. We provide casino operators with a diverse portfolio of products including innovative gaming machines that power the casino floor, and casino operational and management systems that include comprehensive end-to-end payments solutions, critical intelligence offerings, and gaming operations efficiency technologies.
Everi Holdings reports its results of operations based on two operating segments: Games and FinTech. Effective April 1, 2018, we changed the name of the operating segment previously referred to as “Payments” to “Financial Technology Solutions” (“Everi FinTech” or “FinTech”). We believe this reference more accurately reflects the focus of the business segment on delivering innovative and integrated solutions to enhance the efficiency of the casino operator, support the comprehensive regulatory and tax requirements of their gaming customers, and improve players’ gaming experience by providing easy access to their funds and payment of winnings.
Everi Games provides gaming operators products and services, including: (a) gaming machines primarily comprised of Class II and Class III slot machines placed under participation or fixed fee lease arrangements or sold to casino customers, including TournEvent® that allows operators to switch from in-revenue gaming to out-of-revenue tournaments; (b) system software, licenses, ancillary equipment, and maintenance; and (c) business-to-consumer and business-to-business interactive activities. In addition, Everi Games develops and manages the central determinant system for the video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) installed in the State of New York and it also provides similar technology in certain tribal jurisdictions.
Everi FinTech provides gaming operators cash access and related products and services, including: (a) access to cash at gaming facilities via Automated Teller Machine (“ATM”) cash withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions, point of sale (“POS”) debit card cash access transactions, and check verification and warranty services; (b) equipment that provides cash access and efficiency-related services; (c) products and services that improve credit decision making, automate cashier operations, and enhance patron marketing activities for gaming establishments; (d) compliance, audit, and data solutions; and (e) online payment processing solutions for gaming operators in states that offer intrastate, Internet-based gaming, and lottery activities.
Everi Holdings was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on February 4, 2004 and was converted to a Delaware corporation on May 14, 2004. Our principal executive offices are located at 7250 South Tenaya Way, Suite 100, Las Vegas, Nevada 89113. Our telephone number is (800) 833-7110. Our website address is www.everi.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC.
Our Business Segments 
We report our financial performance, and organize and manage our operations, across the following two business segments: (a) Games; and (b) FinTech. For additional information on our segments and the revenues generated by our products and services see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” and “Note 18 — Segment Information” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Products and Services 
Everi Games 
Our Games products and services include commercial devices, such as Native American Class II offerings and other bingo products, Class III offerings, video lottery terminals, accounting and central determinant systems, and other back office systems. We conduct our Games segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (a) Gaming Operations; (b) Gaming Equipment and Systems; and (c) Gaming Other.
Gaming Operations
With respect to our Gaming Operations revenue stream, we primarily offer: (a) leased gaming equipment on a participation or a fixed daily fee basis; (b) local-area progressive machines; (c) wide-area progressive machines (“WAP”); (d) TournEvent® machines; (e) accounting and central determinant systems; and (f) interactive gaming activities. 
5

In connection with our leased gaming equipment, we generally retain ownership of the machines installed at customer facilities. We receive recurring revenue based on a percentage of the net win per day generated by the leased gaming equipment or a fixed daily fee. We continue to expand our game placements into new jurisdictions, increase investment in research and development, and introduce premium game hardware and theme content. From our historical focus on placement of games into the Oklahoma and Washington tribal markets, Everi Games has diversified its installed base in recent years with entry into new commercial and tribal markets. Everi Games has grown premium game installations with approximately 2,859 units installed (representing approximately 20.4% of our installed base as of December 31, 2018) since entering the category approximately six years ago. 
In connection with our WAP offering, machines placed under such arrangements fall into the leased gaming equipment category and we retain ownership of such machines. We debuted our first WAP in Class II markets in 2017 and are now operating in Class III tribal markets as well. Spanning three product lines, our WAP is offered to customers on the Player Classic, Core HDX, and Empire MPX cabinets. The original Class II offering, Jackpot Lockdown®, debuted with two themes — Jackpot Lockdown Mega Meltdown™ and Jackpot Lockdown High Voltage™. With the release of Diamond Blaze™ along with multiple other product offerings active on the link, the original Class II offering has expanded to Everi’s new premium sign package offering, Renegade 3600™. 
Gaming operations also include revenues generated under our arrangement to provide the New York State Gaming Commission with an accounting and central determinant system for the VLTs in operation at licensed State of New York gaming facilities. In January 2018, an amendment to the agreement between Everi Games and the New York State Gaming Commission was approved and became effective. Under this amendment, Everi Games will continue to provide and maintain the central determinant system for the New York Lottery through December 2019. As of December 31, 2018, this system is connected to approximately 18,500 VLTs and has the ability to interface with, provide outcomes to, and manage the VLTs. Pursuant to our agreement with the New York State Gaming Commission, we receive a portion of the network-wide net win (generally, cash-in less prizes paid) per day in exchange for provision and maintenance of the central determinant system. We also provide central determinant system technology to Native American tribes in other licensed jurisdictions for which we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the VLTs connected to the system.
In connection with our interactive activities, Everi operates in the following two areas: (a) business-to-consumer (“B2C”); and (b) business-to-business (“B2B”). B2C relates to games offered directly to consumers through our social, mobile application, which can be played using virtual currency. The Company earns revenues by providing the virtual currency to the consumers, or the players, whenever the consumers purchase additional virtual currency. This offering is limited to the area of free-to-play also referred to as social casinos, and is offered through connectivity with Facebook as well as mobile platforms such as the Apple App Store for Apple devices and the Google Play Store for Android devices. B2B relates to games offered to the online business partners who then offer the games to consumers. Everi has developed its own remote gaming server (“RGS”) leveraging our extensive library of land-based content that is delivered through the RGS. This library contains casino-themed social and mobile games, and games available for real money gaming (“RMG”) offered to the online business partners that operate in play-for-fun, or social casinos, and the regulated online casinos that operate in the RMG regulated markets. We enter into revenue share agreements with online business partners offering Everi's virtual games.
Gaming Equipment and Systems
With respect to our Gaming Equipment and Systems revenue stream, we enter into direct sales contracts generally for some combination of: (a) gaming equipment and player terminals, including TournEvent® machines; (b) game content; (c) license fees; (d) ancillary equipment; and (e) maintenance.
Gaming Other
With respect to our Gaming Other revenue stream, we offer our TournEvent of Champions® that allows winners of local and regional tournaments throughout the year to participate in a national tournament that results in the determination of a final champion. 
Our Games products include:
Classic Mechanical Reel Games. Our full range of classic mechanical reel games provides players with a traditional, high denomination slot gaming experience.

Empire MPX (E43). The Empire MPX debuted in April 2017 with the launch of the Company’s first premium participation cabinet on its WAP, and then launched its for-sale category Empire MPX products in December 2017. The new cabinet features a single-screen 43-inch monitor, full 1080p HD graphics capabilities, and a fully-customizable touchscreen button panel. Its efficient design allows for tighter bank configuration. Empire MPX licensed video content includes Casablanca™, Penn & Teller®, Buffy the Vampire Slayer™, Singin’ in the Rain™, and Willie Nelson™.
Empire MPX (E5527). The E5527 is also uniquely designed to occupy less space on the casino floor, allowing for easy game bank and pod configurations. The all-new premium lease cabinet features a portrait oriented 55-inch upper display and landscape oriented 27-inch lower display that are sure to dazzle players. The cabinet leverages proven technology from Everi’s Empire MPX to deliver an exciting new player experience with visuals never before seen on an Everi gaming device. With its leading-edge cabinet design and innovative technology features, that both players and casino operators will appreciate, E5527 commands attention on the casino floor.
The Texan HDX™. The Texan HDX is an 8-foot tall cabinet with dual 42-inch HD video screens and features a two-person bench seat, integrated touch screens, and a premium three-way sound system. The cabinet is designed to showcase the Everi standard video library in an oversized format, allowing games to be prominently displayed on the casino floor.
TournEvent®. Our slot tournament system that allows gaming operators to switch from in-revenue gaming to out-of-revenue tournaments and to design and build a variety of flexible tournament formats, such as solo or team tournament play, session or round winner advancement, and cumulative or maximum scoring, including providing bonus opportunities that improve scores or automatically move a player to first place. The latest TournEvent® 5.0 game version includes new system enhancements that improve operator efficiencies and hardware and offers engaging tournament games that attract players. With the wireless tablet option, casino operators will be able to sign up players for tournaments remotely, allowing for a more efficient tournament registration and an overall better tournament experience for the casinos and players alike. TournEvent® also is available with multiple sign options, consisting of a 65-inch television, lighted accent dividers, and the ability to be featured on new bank configurations.
Everi FinTech
Our FinTech products and services include solutions that we provide directly to gaming establishments to offer their patrons cash access-related services and products including: access to cash at gaming facilities via ATM cash withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions, and POS debit card cash access transactions; check-related services; fully integrated kiosks and maintenance services; compliance, audit, and data software; casino credit data and reporting services; and other ancillary offerings. We conduct our FinTech segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (a) Cash Access; (b) Equipment; and (c) Information Services and Other.
Cash Access
In connection with our Cash Access services, we offer the following:
ATM Cash Withdrawals. ATM cash withdrawal transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollar and transaction volume. In an ATM cash withdrawal transaction, a patron directly accesses funds from a device enabled with our ATM service by either using an ATM card or a debit card to withdraw funds from the patron’s demand deposit account, or using a credit card to access the patron’s line of credit. In either event, the patron must use the personal identification number (“PIN”) associated with such card. Our processor then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) network to the patron’s bank or issuer, as applicable. 
7

Depending upon a number of factors, including the patron’s account balance or credit limit and daily withdrawal limit (which limits are set by the bank or issuer, as applicable), the bank or issuer will either authorize or decline the transaction. If the transaction is authorized, then the ATM-enabled device dispenses the cash to the patron. For a transaction using an ATM card or a debit card, the patron’s demand deposit account is debited by the amount of cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the ATM service. For a transaction using a credit card with a PIN, the patron’s credit card account is charged by the amount of the cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the ATM service. In both cases, the service fee is currently a fixed dollar amount and not a percentage of the transaction size. We also receive a fee, which we refer to as a reverse interchange fee, from the patron’s card-issuing bank for accommodating the card issuer’s customer. In most circumstances, we pay a percentage of the service fee that we receive from the patron and, in some circumstances, a portion of the reverse interchange fees we receive, as a commission to our gaming establishment customers for the right to operate on their premises.
Credit Card Cash Access Transactions and POS Debit Card Cash Access Transactions. Patrons can perform credit card cash access transactions and POS debit card cash access transactions using many of our enabled devices. A patron’s credit card cash access limit is usually a sub-limit of the total credit line and is set by the card-issuing bank, not Everi FinTech. These limits vary significantly and can be larger or smaller than the POS debit cash access limit. A credit card cash access transaction obligates the patron to repay the issuing bank over time on terms that are preset by the cardholder agreement. A patron’s POS debit card allows the patron to make cash withdrawals at the POS in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of funds in the account, or a daily limit that is generally five to ten times as large as the patron’s daily ATM limit.
When a patron requests a credit card cash access or POS debit card cash access transaction, our processor routes the transaction request through one of the card associations, or EFT networks, to the issuing bank. Depending upon several factors, such as the available credit or bank account balance, the transaction is either authorized or declined by the issuing bank. If authorized, the patron’s bank account is debited or the patron’s credit card balance is increased, in both cases, by an amount equal to the funds requested plus our service fee. The service fee is a fixed dollar amount, a percentage of the transaction size, or a combination of a fixed dollar amount and percentage of the transaction size. If the transaction is authorized, the device informs the patron that the transaction has been approved. The device then further instructs the patron to proceed to the gaming establishment’s cashier, or Company-operated satellite cage (“financial services center”), to complete the transaction because credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions must, in most circumstances, be completed in face-to-face environments and a unique signature must be received in order to comply with rules of the card associations. We reimburse the gaming establishment for the amount of cash that it provided to the patron by paying the gaming establishment via wire transfer or other similar form of electronic payment. In addition, we pay the gaming establishment a portion of the service fee as a commission for the right to operate on its premises. We are also obligated to pay interchange fees to the issuing bank and processing costs related to the electronic payment transaction to card associations.
Check-Related Services. Patrons are able to cash checks at certain gaming establishments. When a patron presents a check to the cashier, the gaming establishment can accept or deny the transaction based on its own customer information and at its own risk, obtain third-party verification information about the check writer, the bank account number, and other information relating to the check to manage its risk, or obtain a warranty on payment of the check, which entitles the gaming establishment to reimbursement of the full amount of the check if it is dishonored.
If a gaming establishment chooses to have a check warranted, it sends a request to a check warranty service provider, inquiring whether it would be willing to accept the risk of cashing the check. If the check warranty provider accepts the risk and warrants the check, the gaming establishment negotiates the patron’s check by providing cash for the face amount of the check. If the check is dishonored by the patron’s bank upon presentment, the gaming establishment invokes the warranty, and the check warranty service provider purchases the check from the gaming establishment for the full check amount and then pursues collection activities on its own.
For those gaming establishments that seek to manage their own risk, we provide a subscription check verification service via a database operated by our subsidiary, Central Credit, LLC (“Central Credit”), which is used by gaming establishments to make credit issuing decisions. Central Credit maintains information on the check cashing and credit history of many gaming establishment patrons. For those gaming establishments that prefer to obtain a warranty, we provide check warranty services through a third-party check warranty service provider. We pay this third-party provider to assist with the warranty decision, check processing, billing, and collection activities. On our behalf, this third-party provider charges our gaming establishment customers a fee for the check warranty services, which is typically a percentage of the face amount of the check being warranted. In such circumstances, we receive all of the check warranty revenue. We are exposed to risk for the losses associated with any warranted items that cannot be collected from patrons issuing the items. Warranty expenses are defined as any amounts paid by the third-party provider to gaming establishments to purchase dishonored checks that will not be collectible from patrons and any expenses related to the collection on these amounts. We also pay certain fees and operating expenses to our third-party provider related to the provision of these services.

Casino Cash Plus 3-in-1 ATMs are unmanned, cash-dispensing machines that enable ATM cash withdrawals, POS debit card cash access transactions, and credit card cash access transactions directly or using our 3-in-1 Rollover functionality. Most financial institutions that issue debit cards impose daily ATM withdrawal limits, and, in some instances, aggregate and count Friday, Saturday, and Sunday as a single day in calculating such limits. If a patron has reached his or her daily ATM limit, our 3-in-1 Rollover functionality automatically enables the patron to obtain funds via a POS debit card cash access transaction or a credit card cash access transaction instead.
CashClub® is a software payments platform that provides gaming establishments with a personal computer workstation software user interface and point-of-sale terminal that streamlines credit and debit card cash access transaction processing and check warranty transactions for casino patrons. It allows for electronic signature capture and dynamic currency conversion. It also interfaces with our Everi Compliance solutions (defined below) to assist casino operations with meeting regulatory requirements under Title 31 of the Bank Secrecy Act.
Equipment
In connection with our Equipment, we offer the following:
Fully Integrated Kiosks are a complete line of products that provide multiple functions to the casino floor. This includes cash access functionality, such as our 3-in-1 Rollover, which provides casino patrons access to perform cash advance, POS debit, and ATM transactions. The kiosks also provide functionality to perform check cashing transactions, slot machine ticket redemption, bill breaking, and loyalty program access as well as integration with mobile and wallet technology. The availability of our cash access platform on these slot ticket redemption devices provides us with additional points of contact with gaming patrons at locations that are usually closer to gaming devices than traditional cash access devices that are typically located on the periphery of the gaming area within the casino floor and also provides gaming patrons with more opportunities to access their cash with less cashier involvement.
Other Integrated Kiosk Solutions provide casinos with more efficient and streamlined methods for cash handling and transaction processing. These products are designed to be integrated with our cash access products and cage compliance software ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and provide an automated way to process common tax forms, such as the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G or Form 1042-S. In addition, we offer equipment in the form of standalone, non-ATM terminals that perform authorizations for credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions. Our kiosk solutions include the following products:

• | JackpotXchange family of kiosks, JXC 4.0, and JXC-L, enable casino personnel to efficiently access funds to pay out jackpots for their guests. These kiosks are integrated with all major slot systems to offer jackpot processing and pay-out in a combination of cash or slot tickets. These kiosks offer gaming operators the ability to reduce workload at the cage and for slot personnel.


• | JackpotXpress is a full-featured jackpot and tax form management platform that allows casino personnel to work through the complex jackpot process using a mobile tablet or kiosk. JackpotXpress allows gaming operators to reduce jackpot wait times, eliminate cumbersome paper documents, and perform “know your customer” checks. It is fully integrated with our Everi Compliance (defined below), CageXchange, and JackpotXchange products.


• | CageXchange is a cash dispensing device that helps streamline casino cage operations. With CageXchange, cash is securely vaulted, creating increased security while also reducing cash shrinkage and helping to improve cashier accuracy. Additional efficiencies are achieved from accelerating the process of cage cashiers obtaining money from the vault. CageXchange is integrated with CashClub® to create an efficient transaction for casino guests.


• | Our Cash Recycling Solutions allow casinos to fully automate the check in and check out process of money, saving time and expense. As gaming establishments vary in size and complexity, these Cash Recycling Solutions support a number of diverse resort operations such as retail, food and beverage, entertainment, and gaming operations.

Information Services and Other
In connection with our Information Services and Other solutions, we offer the following:
Maintenance provides for various forms of support to maintain our fully integrated kiosks. Our support operations, field service, and customer engagement teams provide quarterly and annual maintenance on these products and software systems to help maximize the efficiency of our products.

Everi Compliance is our suite of compliance software offerings for gaming operators that help gaming establishments comply with financial services and gaming regulations, which include software to assist with anti-money laundering regulations, such as filing currency transaction reports (“CTRs”), and suspicious activity reports (“SARs”). In addition, these compliance solutions assist with “know your customer” checks to ensure transactions are appropriately conducted.
Central Credit is our gaming patron credit bureau service which, on a subscription basis, allows gaming establishments to improve their credit-granting decisions by obtaining access to a database containing credit information and transaction data on millions of gaming patrons. Our gaming credit reports are comprised of information recorded from patron credit histories at hundreds of gaming establishments. We provide such information to gaming establishments that subscribe to the service. These establishments then use that data, among other things, to determine how much credit, if any, they will grant to a gaming patron. We typically charge our customers for access to gaming patron credit reports on a monthly basis and our fees are generally comprised of a fixed minimum fee plus per-transaction charges for certain requests.
Other solutions include database services that allow gaming establishments access to information from our proprietary patron transaction database for purposes of player acquisition, direct marketing, market share analysis, and a variety of other patron promotional uses. Our proprietary patron transaction database includes information that is captured from transactions we process. Patrons may “opt out” of having their names included in marketing mailing lists. We also offer an online payment processing solution for gaming operators in states that offer intra-state, Internet-based gaming, and lottery activities.
Manufacturing 
We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the cabinets that make up our electronic gaming machines (“EGMs”), kiosk products, and other sub-assemblies. We have assembly facilities in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada, where we assemble the EGMs and our kiosk products, which include the cabinets, computer assemblies, LCD screens, printers, bill validators and acceptors, and other wiring and harnesses. We believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials for our products are generally adequate and we have few sole-sourced parts.
Research and Development 
We conduct research and development activities primarily to develop gaming systems, game engines, casino data management systems, bingo outcome determination systems, video lottery outcome determination systems, gaming platforms, and gaming content, and to enhance our existing product lines. We believe our ability to deliver differentiated, appealing products and services to the marketplace is based on our research and development investments, and we expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, consulting fees, and game lab testing fees. Once the technological feasibility of a project has been established, it is capitalized until it becomes available for general release. 
Customers 
As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 1,450 casinos and other gaming properties in the United States, Europe, Canada, the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia. In certain limited circumstances, we provide our products and services to non-gaming establishments, such as gas stations and other retail businesses associated with gaming establishment customers. However, the revenue generated from these operations is not material to our operations and we do not actively market or target non-gaming establishment customers.
Sales and Marketing
In our Games business, we sell and market our products and services to gaming establishments primarily through the use of a direct sales force, which targets gaming establishments in the United States and in certain international markets. With respect to our gaming products, we participate in the Class II and Class III gaming machine markets, and the central determinant system market in North America, through participation, or revenue share, and fixed fee arrangements, and the sale of proprietary EGMs and systems. 
In our FinTech business, we sell and market Cash Access (i.e., Cash Advance, ATM, and Check Services), Equipment (i.e., Kiosks Sales), Information Services and Other (i.e., Kiosk Services, Compliance Sales and Services, Central Credit Services, and Ancillary Services) through the use of a direct sales force, which targets gaming establishments in the United States and in certain international markets. 
With respect to both our Games and FinTech businesses, our sales and marketing efforts are directed by a team of customer service executives, each of whom has business development responsibility for gaming establishments in specified geographic regions. 
10

These customer service executives direct their efforts at various levels of gaming establishment personnel, including: senior executives, finance professionals, marketing staff, slot directors, and cashiers, and seek to educate them on the benefits of our products and services. In some cases, our customer service executives are supported by field service and customer engagement teams, who provide on-site customer service to most of our customers. In other cases, our sales executives directly maintain the customer relationships. These customer service executives and field service and customer engagement teams generally reside in the vicinity of the specific gaming establishments they support to ensure a prompt response to the needs of those gaming establishments. We also have joint sales efforts with a number of strategic partners, including independent sales organizations, which allow us to market our products and services to gaming establishments through channels other than our direct sales force.
Competition 
With respect to our Games business, we compete across different gaming markets with a variety of gaming equipment suppliers. Competition is generally based upon the: (a) amount of revenue our products generate for our customers relative to the amount of revenue generated by our competitors’ products; (b) prices and fees we and our competitors charge for products and services offered; and (c) appeal of our competitors’ products to gaming patrons, which has a direct effect on the volume of play generated by a product and, accordingly, the revenues generated for our customers. To drive customer demand and improve product attractiveness, we continually work to develop new game themes, game engines, hardware platforms, and systems that appeal to gaming patrons, all while working to release these new products to the marketplace in a timely manner.
With respect to our FinTech business, we compete with other providers of cash access services to the gaming industry as well as with financial institutions and other regional and local banks that operate ATMs on the premises of gaming establishments. Some of these other providers and financial institutions have established cooperative relationships with each other to expand their service offerings. We also face increased competition from: (a) independent sales organizations, which provide basic services and aggressive pricing; (b) other manufacturers that provide similar goods and services; and (c) traditional transaction processors that have entered the gaming patron cash access services market. This increased competition amongst these various providers of cash access services has resulted in pricing pressure and margin erosion with respect to our core cash access products and services. In addition to competing with various providers of cash access services, FinTech has experienced competition from either those same providers or stand-alone providers of anti-money laundering compliance products and self-service kiosks for ticket redemption and jackpot redemption. 
Intellectual Property 
We believe the ability to introduce and respond to technological innovation in the gaming industry will be an increasingly important qualification for the future success of any provider of cash access and gaming-related products and services. Our continued competitiveness will depend on: (a) the pace of our new product development; (b) our patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection; and (c) our relationships with customers. Our business development personnel work with gaming establishments, our technology and other strategic partners, and the suppliers of the financial services upon which our cash access services rely, to design and develop innovative products and services that appeal to gaming patrons.
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. The expiration dates of these patents vary and are based on their filing and issuances dates. We intend to continue to actively file for patent protection, when such filings are commercially reasonable, within and outside the United States. We also seek trademark protection for our names and products and have registered hundreds of trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. Under permission or license agreements with third parties, we also sell gaming products covered by independently filed copyrights, trademarks, or patents. Typically, these contracts require us to pay royalties to the licensing party. Royalty expenses are included in the cost of gaming and systems in our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our patents, trademarks, and copyrights, we also rely on a broader scope of intellectual property including trade secrets, in-house know-how, and innovation.
Seasonality
Our revenues and cash flows may fluctuate throughout the year driven by seasonality in player demand and activity. We generally experience higher operating results during the first half of a year and lower operating results during the second half of a year, however, such fluctuations do not have a material impact on our revenues and cash flows. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,250 employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have never experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

REGULATION 
General
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material gaming and financial institution laws applicable to our business. We have a diligent internal compliance program to ensure compliance with our business activities, as well as legal requirements generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is directed on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Compliance Officer. Legal advice is provided by attorneys from the Company’s legal department and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Corporate Compliance Committee, which includes a gaming law expert as an independent member. We can give no assurance, however, that our business activities or the activities of our customers in the gaming industry will not be subject to any regulatory or legal enforcement proceedings in the future and a violation of applicable laws by us or any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, prospects, and results of operations. Depending on the nature of any noncompliance, our failure to comply with such laws, regulations, and ordinances may result in the suspension or revocation of any license, registration, or other approval, a partial or complete cessation of our business, seizure of our assets, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.
Gaming Regulation 
The gaming industry is highly regulated under legal systems that frequently evolve and change based on governmental public policies. Various aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to the ownership, management, and operation of gambling establishments as well as certain financial services conducted at such establishments. The stated policies and other purposes behind such laws, regulations, and ordinances are generally to: (i) ensure the public’s trust and confidence in legalized gambling through a system of mandated regulation, internal controls, accounting practices, and operating procedures; and (ii) promote economic activity for the state, county, and local governments through revenue opportunities emanating from taxes, licensing fees, and other economic benefits arising out of gambling and related activities.
A description of the material regulations to which we are subject is set forth below.

We are regulated by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal, and foreign government agencies (collectively, “Gaming Authorities”) in the jurisdictions where we conduct business as either a: (i) manufacturer of gaming devices, in those jurisdictions where we manufacture gaming devices and systems; (ii) supplier of “associated equipment,” in those jurisdictions where we sell and service fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions; and (iii) non-gaming supplier or vendor, in those jurisdictions where we provide cash access and Central Credit services only. We must maintain those licenses, registrations, or other approvals in good standing to continue our business. Gaming Authorities have broad discretion in determining whether to grant a license, registration, or other approval. Subject to complying with certain procedural requirements, Gaming Authorities may deny any application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification, or other approval for any cause deemed reasonable to them. 
Approvals, Licensing and Suitability
The process of obtaining necessary licenses, registrations, or other approvals often involves substantial disclosure of confidential or proprietary information about us and our officers, directors, key personnel and, in certain instances, beneficial owners of our debt or equity securities, and requires a determination by the regulators as to our suitability as a manufacturer, supplier, or vendor to gaming establishments. Gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may require any beneficial holder of our securities, regardless of the number of shares of common stock or amount of debt securities owned, to file an application, make personal or confidential disclosures, be investigated, and be subject to a determination of suitability. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to Gaming Authorities, and Gaming Authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.

Product Approvals
Our gaming devices and certain other products and technologies must be certified or approved by Gaming Authorities in many jurisdictions where we conduct business. These Gaming Authorities test the gaming devices, systems, and related equipment directly or through an independent testing laboratory and may also require a field trial under the regulator’s technical standards before allowing us to sell the product. Although we collaborate closely with the Gaming Authorities and independent testing laboratories, we cannot control whether our products will be approved or the length of time taken to review our products for sale to third parties. Moreover, there are no guarantees that we will be successful in obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals and to continue to hold other necessary gaming licenses, permits, and approvals to conduct our businesses either as currently being conducted by us or to expand our businesses.
Our Native American customers are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”), which was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”). The NIGC has regulatory authority over certain aspects of Native American gaming and defines the boundaries of our dealings with the Native American marketplace and the level of regulatory authority to which these games are subject. IGRA establishes three classes of gaming, each with a different regulatory framework:

Class | Type of Games | Regulatory Oversight 
I | Social gaming for minimal prizes and traditional Indian gaming. | Exclusive regulation and oversight by tribal governments. 
II | Bingo (both in traditional and electronic form). | Regulation by tribal governments with NIGC oversight. 
III | Casino style games (including slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette). | Must be permitted by the state in which the tribe is located. The state and the tribe must have negotiated a compact approved by NIGC, and the tribe must have adopted a gaming ordinance approved by the NIGC.


We sell our gaming devices and systems in both Class II and Class III markets.
Class III gaming on Native American tribal lands is usually subject to the negotiation of a compact between the tribe and the proximate state attendant to where the tribe intends to operate a gaming facility. These tribal-state compacts typically include provisions entitling the state to receive significant sums of money in exchange for the tribe’s operation of Class III gaming. While tribal-state compacts are intended to document the agreement between the state and a tribe, these tribal-state compacts can be subject to disputes relative to permitted Class III gaming operations.
The Johnson Act. The Johnson Act, as amended by the federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (the “Johnson Act”), requires that we register annually with the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice and requires a wide variety of record keeping and equipment identification efforts on our part. Registration is required in order for us to sell, distribute, manufacture, transport, or receive gaming equipment, machines, or components across state lines. If we fail to comply with the requirements set forth under the Johnson Act, we could become subject to a variety of penalties, including, but not limited to, the seizure and forfeiture of equipment.
Internet and Online Gaming Regulation. Several states have passed implementing legislation and regulations to allow certain intra-state, wager-based, online casino, or lottery games, such as online poker, online lottery, lottery ticket purchases, or lottery ticket subscriptions. To date, several states have authorized some form of Internet or online gaming or lottery activities. However, the legislative and regulatory framework governing these activities may continue to evolve in the future.
Financial Services Regulation 
Our FinTech business is also subject to a number of financial services regulations:
Durbin Amendment. Rules promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, required as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), including the so-called Durbin Amendment (the “Durbin Amendment”), establish, among other things, standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by certain debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Debit card interchange fees are established by payment card networks and ultimately paid by merchants to debit card issuers for each debit transaction.

Anti-Money Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, other federal statutes, generally referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act, and implementing federal regulations require us to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program. Our anti-money laundering program includes: internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to identify and report money laundering, a designated compliance officer, an ongoing employee training program, and an independent audit function to test the program. In addition, the cash access services that we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Our gaming establishment customers are required to file a SAR with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to report any suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. We are also required to file a SAR where we provide our cash access services directly to patrons through financial services centers that we staff and operate. To be reportable, such a transaction must meet criteria that are designed to identify the hiding or disguising of funds derived from illegal activities. Our gaming establishment customers, in situations where our cash access services are provided through gaming establishment cashier personnel, and we, in situations where we provide our cash access services through a financial services center, are required to file a CTR of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer by, through, or to us which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 in a single day. Our CashClub® product can assist in identifying transactions that give rise to reporting obligations. 
Fund Transfers. Our POS debit card cash access transactions, credit card cash access transactions, and ATM services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides cardholders with rights with respect to electronic fund transfers, including the right to dispute unauthorized charges, charges that list the wrong date or amount, charges for goods and services that are not accepted or delivered as agreed, math errors, and charges for which a cardholder asks for an explanation or written proof of transaction along with a claimed error or request for clarification. We believe the necessary policies and procedures have been implemented throughout our organization in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for fund transfers.
State Money Transmission Laws. Many states where we complete credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions or offer our online payment processing solution require us to have a money transmitter license.
Credit Reporting. Our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services and check verification and warranty services are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACTA”) and their implementing rules, which require consumer credit bureaus, such as Central Credit, to provide credit report information to businesses only for certain purposes and to otherwise safeguard credit report information, to disclose to consumers their credit report on request, and to permit consumers to dispute and correct inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit report. These laws and rules also govern the information that may be contained in a consumer credit report. We continue to implement policies and procedures as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition to federal regulations, our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services are subject to the state credit reporting regulations that impose similar requirements to the FCRA and the FACTA.
Debt Collection. We currently outsource most of our debt collection efforts to third parties. However, we do engage in debt collection to collect on chargebacks on our cash access products and unpaid balances for services performed for our check services, Central Credit services, compliance services, receivables relating to the sale and service of our fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, and other amounts owing to us in connection with performing various services for our customers. All such collection practices may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”), which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive debt collection practices, as well as consumer-debt-collection laws and regulations adopted by the various states.
Privacy Regulations. Our collection of information from patrons who use our financial products and services, such as our cash access services, are subject to the financial information privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) and its implementing federal regulations. We gather, as permitted by law, non-public, personally-identifiable financial information from patrons who use our cash access services, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank and credit card account numbers, and transaction information. The GLBA requires us to safeguard and protect the privacy of such non-public personal information and also requires us to make disclosures to patrons regarding our privacy and information sharing policies and give patrons the opportunity to direct us not to disclose information about them to unaffiliated third parties in certain situations. We are also subject to state privacy regulations which, in some cases, may be even stricter than federal law. We continue to implement policies and programs as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations. In addition, we are also subject to foreign data protection and privacy laws including, but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and requires companies to meet new requirements regarding data privacy and security. 
ATM Operations. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires us to disclose certain notices regarding the fees that we charge for performing an ATM transaction as well as to incorporate such notices on the ATM screens to notify patrons of such fees prior to completing an ATM transaction. Our ATM services are also subject to applicable state banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs which require, among other things, that we register with the state banking regulators as an operator of 
14

ATMs, that we provide gaming patrons with notices of the transaction fees assessed upon use of our ATMs, that our transaction fees do not exceed designated maximums, that we offer gaming patrons a means of resolving disputes with us, and that we comply with prescribed safety and security requirements. In addition, the ATMs that we operate are subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons.
Check Cashing. In jurisdictions in which we serve as a check casher, we are required to be licensed by the applicable state banking regulator to operate as a check casher. Some states also impose restrictions on this activity, such as limits on the amounts of service fees that may be imposed on the cashing of certain types of checks, requirements as to records that must be kept with respect to dishonored checks and requirements as to the contents of receipts that must be delivered to gaming patrons at the time a check is cashed.
Network and Card Association Regulations. In addition to the governmental regulation described above, some of our services are also subject to rules promulgated by various payment networks, EFT networks, and card associations. For example, we must comply with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard. We have been designated as a compliant service provider under the PCI Data Security Standard. We must be certified to maintain our status as a compliant service provider on an annual basis.
EMV, designed to deter fraudulent card transactions related to identity theft, counterfeit cards, and the misuse of lost or stolen cards via enhanced card authentication, transaction authorization, and cardholder verification using chip-based smart-cards. EMV has been adopted in many regions of the world as the global standard for fraud deterrence in chip-based smart-card payments. In October 2015, the network and card associations began shifting liability for fraudulent POS and ATM transactions generated through EMV-capable cards onto merchants whose devices are not capable of processing chip-based smart-card EMV transactions. This shifts the responsibility for chargebacks due to fraudulent transactions on such cards from the card issuer onto the merchant.
As a merchant of cash access transactions processed through MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express, all who have adopted the EMV standard, and as an operator of ATMs, our POS, fully integrated kiosk, and ATM devices are subject to the EMV standard. This requires us to maintain our fleet of U.S.-based POS, fully integrated kiosk, and ATM devices to support the EMV standard.
International Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of gaming and financial services regulations and other laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in the international markets in which we operate. We expect to become subject to additional gaming and financial services regulations and other laws in the jurisdictions into which we expand our operations. Our expansion into new markets is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions. 
In addition, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation of Our Industry” for additional industry, state, and federal regulations impacting our business.
