ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 
Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on improving the lives of patients by developing best-in-class treatments to address some of the most important unmet patient needs. We are developing novel, patient-focused solutions that apply our innovative science and technologies to already-approved pharmacological agents for patients suffering from cancer or pain. 
 On August 9, 2016, our first commercial product, SUSTOL, was approved by the FDA. SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist that utilizes Herons Biochronomer Technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for ³5 days. We commenced commercial sales of SUSTOL in the U.S. in October 2016. 
 On November 9, 2017, our second commercial product, CINVANTI, was approved by the FDA. CINVANTI, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC). CINVANTI is an intravenous (IV) formulation of aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist. CINVANTI is the only IV formulation of an NK1 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC that is free of polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. We commenced commercial sales of CINVANTI in the U.S. in January 2018.

 HTX-011, which utilizes Herons proprietary Biochronomer Technology, is an investigational, long-acting, extended-release formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for postoperative pain management. By delivering sustained levels of both a potent anesthetic and a local anti-inflammatory agent directly to the site of tissue injury, HTX-011 was designed to deliver superior pain relief while reducing the need for systemically administered pain medications such as opioids, which carry the risk of harmful side effects, abuse and addiction. HTX-011 has been shown to reduce pain significantly better than placebo or bupivacaine alone in five diverse surgical models: hernia repair, abdominoplasty, bunionectomy, total knee arthroplasty and breast augmentation. HTX-011 was granted Fast Track designation from the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Breakthrough Therapy designation in the second quarter of 2018. The FDA recently accepted our New Drug Application (NDA) for HTX-011, and has granted it a Priority Review designation. The FDA set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of April 30, 2019 and indicated that it is not currently planning an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application. 
 HTX-034, our next-generation product candidate for postoperative pain management, is in development for postoperative pain via local application. Based on the positive results of preclinical studies in which HTX-034 demonstrated significant pain reduction for seven days, we have initiated formal development of this next-generation postoperative pain management product candidate. 
 Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Product Portfolio 
 SUSTOL 
 SUSTOL was our first commercial product. SUSTOL was approved by the FDA on August 9, 2016, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in October 2016. 
 SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that utilizes our Biochronomer Technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for ³5 days. The SUSTOL global Phase 3 development program was comprised of two, large, guideline-based clinical studies that evaluated SUSTOLs efficacy and safety in more than 2,000 patients with cancer. SUSTOLs efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting was evaluated in both the acute phase (0  24 hours following chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24  120 hours following chemotherapy). 
 SUSTOL is the first extended-release 5-HT3 receptor antagonist approved for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with both MEC and AC combination chemotherapy regimens. A standard of care in the treatment of breast cancer and other cancer types, AC regimens are among the most commonly prescribed HEC regimens, as defined by both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). 
 In February 2017, the NCCN included SUSTOL as a part of its NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Antiemesis Version 1.2017. The NCCN has given SUSTOL a Category 1 recommendation, the highest level category of evidence and consensus, for use in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving HEC or MEC regimens. The guidelines now identify SUSTOL as a preferred agent for preventing nausea and vomiting following MEC. Further, the guidelines highlight the unique, extended-release formulation of SUSTOL. 
 In January 2018, a product-specific billing code, or permanent J-code (J-code), for SUSTOL became available. The new J-code was assigned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and will help simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of SUSTOL. 
 CINVANTI 
 CINVANTI is our second commercial product. CINVANTI was approved by the FDA on November 9, 2017, and we commenced commercial sales in the U.S. in January 2018. 
 CINVANTI, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (HEC) including high-dose cisplatin and nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy (MEC).

 CINVANTI is an IV formulation of aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist. CINVANTI is the first IV formulation to directly deliver aprepitant, the active ingredient in EMEND® capsules. Aprepitant (including its prodrug, fosaprepitant) is the only single-agent NK1 receptor antagonist to significantly reduce nausea and vomiting in both the acute phase (0  24 hours after chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (24  120 hours after chemotherapy). CINVANTI is the only IV formulation of an NK1 receptor antagonist indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC that is free of polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. 
 NK1 receptor antagonists are typically used in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The only other injectable NK1 receptor antagonist currently approved in the U.S. for both acute and delayed CINV, EMEND® IV (fosaprepitant), contains polysorbate 80, a synthetic surfactant, which has been linked to hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and infusion site reactions. The CINVANTI formulation does not contain polysorbate 80 or any other synthetic surfactant. Our CINVANTI data has demonstrated the bioequivalence of CINVANTI to EMEND IV, supporting its efficacy for the prevention of both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with HEC and nausea and vomiting associated with MEC. Results also showed CINVANTI was better tolerated in healthy volunteers than EMEND IV, with significantly fewer adverse events reported with CINVANTI. 
 In November 2018, a J-code for CINVANTI was assigned with an effective date of January 1, 2019. The new J-code was assigned by CMS and will help simplify the billing and reimbursement process for prescribers of CINVANTI. 
 Pain Management Product Portfolio 
 HTX-011
HTX-011, which utilizes our Biochronomer Technology, is an investigational, long-acting, extended-release formulation of the local anesthetic bupivacaine in a fixed-dose combination with the anti-inflammatory meloxicam for postoperative pain management. By delivering sustained levels of both a potent anesthetic and a local anti-inflammatory agent directly to the site of tissue injury, HTX-011 was designed to deliver superior pain relief while reducing the need for systemically administered pain medications such as opioids, which carry the risk of harmful side effects, abuse and addiction. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for HTX-011, and has granted it a Priority Review designation. The FDA set a PDUFA goal date of April 30, 2019 and indicated that it is not currently planning an advisory committee meeting to discuss this application. 
 In January 2019, we reported positive topline results of a multi-center postoperative pain management study in which 63 patients undergoing hernia repair surgery received the investigational agent, HTX-011, together with a regimen of generic over-the-counter (OTC) oral analgesics (acetaminophen and ibuprofen). Designed as a follow-up to the Phase 3 study in hernia repair completed in 2018, this study included many of the same investigators and the same entry criteria as the Phase 3 study. The goal of the current study was to increase the proportion of opioid-free patients by combining HTX-011 with a regimen of readily available, oral analgesics. Topline results of the study include the following: 
 

 | 90% of patients receiving HTX-011 with the OTC analgesic regimen did not require opioids to manage their postoperative pain through 72 hours post-surgery, compared to 51%, 40% and 22% of patients receiving HTX-011, bupivacaine and placebo, respectively, in the prior Phase 3 study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 81% of patients receiving HTX-011 with the OTC analgesic regimen remained opioid-free through 28 days post-surgery.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Over 72 hours post-surgery, patients receiving HTX-011 plus the OTC analgesic regimen consumed an average of 0.9 morphine milligram equivalents (MME), which compares to 10.8 MME, 14.5 MME and 17.5 MME for patients receiving HTX-011, bupivacaine and placebo, respectively, in the prior Phase 3 study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In June 2018, we reported positive topline results from two completed Phase 2b studies of HTX-011: Study 209 (local administration in total knee arthroplasty) and Study 211 (instillation or pectoral pocket nerve block in breast augmentation). HTX-011 achieved the primary endpoints in both studies.

 Total Knee Arthroplasty  Study 209 Results
Study 209 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2b clinical study in patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of locally administered HTX-011 into the surgical site. Following a dose-escalation phase, 222 patients were randomized to receive: (1) HTX-011 400 mg administered via instillation into the surgical site (HTX-011 alone); (2) HTX-011 400 mg administered via instillation into the surgical site with a low dose of ropivacaine injected into the posterior capsule (HTX-011 combination); (3) bupivacaine 125 mg administered via multiple injections into the surgical site; and (4) placebo. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine are generically available standard-of-care local anesthetics used in postoperative pain management. This study included a pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy for the primary and key secondary endpoints for the HTX-011 400 mg treatment groups. The primary endpoint was pain intensity as measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0 to 48 hours post-surgery (AUC 0-48) for HTX-011 compared to placebo. The key secondary endpoint was pain intensity as measured by the AUC from 0 to 72 hours post-surgery (AUC 0-72) for HTX-011 compared to placebo. The primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved: 
 

 | The HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone resulted in reductions of 23% and 19%, respectively, in pain intensity measured at rest through 48 hours when compared to placebo (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002, respectively). These pain reductions from HTX-011 were approximately double that of bupivacaine, which resulted in a reduction of 11%. The HTX-011 combination reduction was significantly better than that of bupivacaine (p=0.0212).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone resulted in reductions of 22% and 19%, respectively, in pain intensity measured at rest through 72 hours when compared to placebo (p<0.0001 and p=0.0004, respectively). These pain reductions from HTX-011 were also approximately double that of bupivacaine, which resulted in a reduction of 11%. The HTX-011 combination reduction was significantly better than that of bupivacaine through 72 hours (p=0.0325).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | With the more conservative assessment of pain with activity, the HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone resulted in reductions of 16% and 12%, respectively, in pain intensity measured with activity through 48 hours when compared to placebo (p<0.0001 and p=0.0017, respectively). These pain reductions from HTX-011 were significantly better than that of bupivacaine, which resulted in a reduction of 4% (p=0.0012 and p=0.0366, respectively). Both the HTX-011 combination and HTX-011 alone maintained control of pain with activity through 72 hours with a 15% (p=0.0002) and 11% (p=0.0058) reduction compared to placebo, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The HTX-011 combination significantly reduced opioid use through 48 and 72 hours compared to placebo (p=0.0091 and p=0.0253, respectively).

 Breast Augmentation  Study 211 Results
Study 211 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2b dose-finding study in patients undergoing augmentation mammoplasty to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of HTX-011 when administered by instillation into the surgical site or via ultrasound-guided lateral and medial pectoral nerve block before surgery. The study consisted of three cohorts comparing HTX-011 nerve block (60 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg) to the standard dose of bupivacaine 50 mg, administered as a nerve block, and placebo, and a final cohort comparing both HTX-011 400 mg administered by instillation and HTX-011 400 mg administered as a nerve block to the same two control groups. A total of 243 patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was pain intensity as measured by the AUC from 0 to 24 hours post-surgery (AUC 0-24) compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was achieved: 
 

 | HTX-011 400 mg administered by instillation into the surgical site and HTX-011 400 mg administered as a nerve block both resulted in reductions of 22% in pain intensity measured at rest through 24 hours when compared to placebo (p=0.0023 and p=0.0055, respectively). These pain reductions from HTX-011 were approximately triple that of bupivacaine administered as a nerve block, which resulted in a reduction of 8%. The HTX-011 400 mg instillation reduction was significantly better than that of bupivacaine (p=0.0383).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | With the more conservative assessment of pain with activity, HTX-011 400 mg instillation and HTX-011 400 mg nerve block resulted in reductions of 24% and 23%, respectively, in pain intensity measured with activity through 24 hours when compared to placebo (p=0.0004 and p=0.0015, respectively). These pain reductions from HTX-011 were approximately double that of bupivacaine administered as a nerve block, which resulted in a reduction of 12%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | HTX-011 400 mg instillation and HTX-011 400 mg nerve block resulted in reductions in total opioid use of 33% and 26%, respectively, when compared to placebo (p=0.0093 and p=0.0435, respectively). These reductions from HTX-011 were approximately triple that of bupivacaine administered as a nerve block, which resulted in a reduction of 10%. The HTX-011 400 mg instillation reduction was significantly better than that of bupivacaine (p=0.0455).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There was a strong correlation between pain reduction and the pharmacokinetics of HTX-011 in both studies. 
 HTX-011 was well tolerated in both studies, with a safety profile comparable to placebo and bupivacaine solution. There were no deaths and no clinically meaningful differences in overall adverse events, serious adverse events, premature discontinuations due to adverse events, potential local anesthetic systemic toxicity related adverse events or wound healing. 
 In June 2018, we announced that we have been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for HTX-011 from the FDA for postoperative pain management. Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates substantial improvement over available therapies on clinically significant endpoint(s). Breakthrough Therapy designation was granted for HTX-011 based on the results of Phase 2 studies and two recently completed Phase 3 studies, which showed that HTX-011 produced significant reductions in both pain intensity and the need for opioids through 72 hours post-surgery compared to placebo and bupivacaine solution, the standard of care. 
 In March 2018, we reported positive topline results from EPOCH1 and EPOCH2, our pivotal Phase 3 studies of HTX-011 in bunionectomy and hernia repair, respectively. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Furthermore, HTX-011 is the only long-acting local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and opioid use compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control, through 72 hours. 
 The primary and key secondary endpoints for both Phase 3 studies were identical. The primary endpoint was pain intensity as measured by the AUC 0-72 compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints in order of evaluation were: 
 

 | comparison of AUC 0-72 of pain intensity to bupivacaine solution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the total amount of opioid rescue medication consumption compared to placebo through 72 hours after surgery;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the proportion of patients who received no opioid rescue medication after surgery compared to bupivacaine solution; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the total opioid consumption through 72 hours after surgery compared to bupivacaine.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Bunionectomy  Study 301/EPOCH1 Results
EPOCH1 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of locally administered HTX-011 at 60 mg compared to the standard dose of bupivacaine solution (50 mg) and placebo for postoperative pain control following bunionectomy surgery in 412 subjects. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved: 

 | There was a 27% reduction in pain intensity as measured by AUC 0-72 when comparing HTX-011 to placebo (p<0.0001);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | There was an 18% reduction in pain as measured by AUC 0-72 when comparing HTX-011 to bupivacaine solution (p=0.0002);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Over 72 hours post-surgery, patients receiving HTX-011 consumed 37% less opioids than placebo patients (p<0.0001) and 25% less opioids than patients receiving bupivacaine solution (p=0.0022); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 29% of patients receiving HTX-011 required no opioid medication for 72 hours post-surgery compared to only 2% receiving placebo (p<0.0001) and 11% receiving the standard-of-care, bupivacaine solution (p=0.0001). These results parallel the significantly reduced incidence of severe pain in patients receiving HTX-011 compared to both placebo (36% reduction; p<0.0001) and bupivacaine (29% reduction; p<0.0001).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hernia Repair  Study 302/EPOCH2 Results
EPOCH2 was a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of locally administered HTX-011 at 300 mg compared to the standard dose of bupivacaine solution (75 mg) and placebo for postoperative pain control following hernia repair surgery in 418 subjects. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved: 

 | There was a 23% reduction in pain intensity as measured by AUC 0-72 when comparing HTX-011 to placebo (p=0.0004);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | There was a 21% reduction in pain as measured by AUC 0-72 when comparing HTX-011 to bupivacaine solution (p<0.0001);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Over 72 hours post-surgery, patients receiving HTX-011 consumed 38% less opioids than placebo patients (p=0.0001) and 25% less opioids than patients receiving bupivacaine solution (p=0.0240); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | 51% of patients receiving HTX-011 required no opioid medication for 72 hours post-surgery compared to only 22% receiving placebo (p<0.0001) and 40% receiving the standard-of-care, bupivacaine solution (p=0.0486). These results parallel the significantly reduced incidence of severe pain in patients receiving HTX-011 compared to both placebo (40% reduction; p<0.0001) and bupivacaine (19% reduction; p=0.0372).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 HTX-011 was well tolerated in both studies, with a safety profile comparable to placebo and bupivacaine solution. There were no drug-related serious adverse events or discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events in HTX-011-treated patients, and there were fewer opioid-related adverse events in HTX-011-treated patients. 
 HTX-011 is the only long-acting anesthetic designed to address both postoperative pain and inflammation in a single administration at the surgical site. The unique synergy of bupivacaine and meloxicam in HTX-011 has consistently been shown to reduce pain over 72 hours significantly better than bupivacaine alone in multiple diverse surgical models. HTX-011 is administered as a single-dose application via needle-free syringe to directly coat the affected tissue within the surgical site prior to suturing, which makes HTX-011s route of administration faster, easier and potentially safer compared to numerous injections required with current local anesthetics. 
 In October 2017, we announced that we have been granted Fast Track designation for HTX-011 from the FDA for local administration into the surgical site to reduce postoperative pain and the need for opioid analgesics for 72 hours. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs by providing sponsors with the opportunity for frequent interactions with the FDA. 
 Biochronomer Technology 
 Our proprietary Biochronomer Technology is designed to deliver therapeutic levels of a wide range of otherwise short-acting pharmacological agents over a period from days to weeks with a single administration. Our Biochronomer Technology consists of bioerodible polymers that have been the subject of comprehensive animal and human toxicology studies that have shown evidence of the safety of the polymer. When administered, the polymers undergo controlled hydrolysis, resulting in a controlled, sustained release of the pharmacological agent encapsulated within the Biochronomer-based composition. Furthermore, our Biochronomer Technology is designed to permit more than one pharmacological agent to be incorporated, such that multimodal therapy can be delivered with a single administration. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our U.S.-based sales and marketing team consists of 68 employees as of February 1, 2019. The sales and marketing infrastructure includes a targeted, oncology sales force to establish relationships with a focused group of oncologists and oncology nurses. Additionally, the sales and marketing teams manage relationships with key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, hospital systems, oncology group networks and government accounts. The sales force is supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. We are currently building our U.S.-based sales and marketing team to support the commercialization of HTX-011, if approved.

 Customers 
 SUSTOL is distributed in the U.S. through a limited number of specialty distributors (Customers) that subsequently resell SUSTOL to healthcare providers, the end users of SUSTOL. CINVANTI is distributed in the U.S. through a limited number of Customers that resell CINVANTI to healthcare providers and hospitals, the end users of CINVANTI. 
 Sales to three different Customers separately accounted for 10% or more of our SUSTOL and CINVANTI net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales to two Customers accounted for 10% or more of our SUSTOL net product sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
 We have engaged a third-party service provider to act as our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of our products to our Customers in the U.S. In addition to distribution services, other related services, including product storage, returns, customer support and administrative support are provided. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors are many in number and include major and mid-sized pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. SUSTOL, CINVANTI and HTX-011 compete in, and any other products that we may develop or discover, if approved, will compete in, highly competitive markets. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and product candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
SUSTOL faces significant competition. Currently available 5-HT3 receptor antagonists include: AKYNZEO® (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Helsinn Therapeutics (U.S.), Inc.); SANCUSO® (granisetron transdermal patch, marketed by ProStrakan Group Plc); and generic products including ondansetron (formerly marketed by GlaxoSmithKline plc as ZOFRAN), granisetron (formerly marketed by Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. as KYTRIL) and palonosetron (formerly marketed by Eisai in conjunction with Helsinn Healthcare S.A. as ALOXI). Currently, palonosetron is the only 5-HT3 receptor antagonist other than SUSTOL that is approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with MEC regimens. SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens, which is considered to be a HEC regimen by the NCCN and ASCO. No other 5-HT3 receptor antagonist is specifically approved for the prevention of delayed CINV associated with a HEC regimen. 
 NK1 receptor antagonists are also administered for the prevention of CINV, in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, to augment the therapeutic effect of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. CINVANTI faces significant competition. Currently available NK1 receptor antagonists include: AKYNZEO® (palonosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, combined with netupitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist, marketed by Eisai, Inc.); EMEND® (aprepitant, marketed by Merck & Co, Inc.); EMEND® IV (fosaprepitant, marketed by Merck & Co); VARUBI® (rolapitant, marketed byTerSera Therapeutics LLC) and potentially other products that include an NK1 receptor antagonist that reach the market. 
 If we are able to successfully develop HTX-011 for postoperative pain management, we will compete with MARCAINE (bupivacaine, marketed by Hospira, Inc.) and generic forms of bupivacaine; NAROPIN (ropivacaine, marketed by Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC) and generic forms of ropivacaine; EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension, marketed by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and potentially other products in development for postoperative pain management that reach the market.

 Manufacturing and Clinical Supplies 
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of commercial or clinical quantities of SUSTOL, CINVANTI or HTX-011. We rely on a small number of third-party manufacturers to produce our compounds and expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates and for all of our commercial needs. We currently have long-term commercial supply agreements with certain third-party manufacturers. Our manufacturing and processing agreements require that all third-party contract manufacturers and processors produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products in accordance with the FDAs current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain confidentiality agreements with potential and existing manufacturers in order to protect our proprietary rights related to SUSTOL, CINVANTI, HTX-011, HTX-034 and our Biochronomer Technology. 
 Some of the critical materials and components used in manufacturing SUSTOL, CINVANTI and HTX-011 are sourced from single suppliers. An interruption in the supply of a key material could significantly delay our research and development process or increase our expenses for commercialization or development of products. Specialized materials must often be manufactured for the first time for use in drug delivery technologies, or materials may be used in the technologies in a manner that is different from their customary commercial uses. The quality of materials can be critical to the performance of a drug delivery technology, so a reliable source that provides a consistent supply of materials is important. Materials or components needed for our drug delivery technologies may be difficult to obtain on commercially reasonable terms, particularly when relatively small quantities are required or if the materials traditionally have not been used in pharmaceutical products. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our success will depend in large part on our ability to: 
 

 | obtain and maintain international and domestic patents and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prosecute and defend our patents;
--+----------------------------------


 | preserve our trade secrets; and
--+--------------------------------


 | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for the product candidates in our research and development programs and their uses by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. 
 We have filed a number of U.S. patent applications on inventions relating to the composition of a variety of polymers, specific products, product groups and processing technology. As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 25 issued U.S. patents and an additional 32 issued (or registered) foreign patents. The patents on the bioerodible technologies expire between May 2021 and March 2026. Currently, SUSTOL is covered by seven patents issued in the U.S. and by 30 patents issued in foreign countries including Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. U.S. patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to September 2024; foreign patents covering SUSTOL have expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to September 2025. Currently, CINVANTI is covered by five patents issued in the U.S. with expiration dates of September 2035. HTX-011 is protected by eight patents issued in the U.S. with expiration dates ranging from May 2021 to April 2035 and one patent issued in Mexico and one patent issued in Japan both with expiration dates of March 2034. Our policy is to actively seek patent protection in the U.S. and to pursue equivalent patent claims in selected foreign countries, thereby seeking patent coverage for novel technologies and compositions of matter that may be commercially important to the development of our business. Granted patents include claims covering the product composition, methods of use and methods of preparation. Our existing patents may not cover future products, additional patents may not be issued and current patents, or patents issued in the future, may not provide meaningful protection or prove to be of commercial benefit. 
 
12 


 Although we believe that our rights under patent applications we own provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. Any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors. 
 Government Regulation 
 Pharmaceutical Regulation 
 Pharmaceutical products that we market in the U.S. are subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation. 
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, research and development activities, manufacturing, quality, storage, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, there is a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs and ongoing oversight of marketed products. We are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug products if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the U.S. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our development of commercial products and industry regulation. 
 Regulation in the U.S. 
 The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. The FDA approval process for new drugs includes, without limitation: 
 

 | preclinical studies;
--+---------------------


 | submission in the U.S. of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), for clinical trials conducted in the U.S.;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review of an NDA in the U.S.; and
--+----------------------------------


 | inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDAs current cGMP regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDAs risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also place a hold on one or more clinical trials conducted under an IND for a drug if it deems warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval of an NDA is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions. 
 
13 


 Preclinical Testing 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product and animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to Good Laboratory Practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. 
 An IND is the request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes information regarding the preclinical studies, the investigational products chemistry and manufacturing, supporting data and literature and the investigational plan and protocol(s). Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials begin. We have filed INDs in the U.S. and Clinical Trial Applications (CTAs) in the European Union (EU), and we may file additional INDs and CTAs in the future. We cannot assure that submission of any additional INDs or CTAs for any of our product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials. 
 Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator and in accordance with a clinical trial protocol, which sets forth details, such as the study objectives, enrollment criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) in the U.S. or ethics committee in the EU at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB or ethics committee will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. In addition, clinical trials in the U.S. must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents. Some studies include oversight by an independent group of experts, known as a data safety monitoring board, which authorizes whether a study may move forward based on certain data from the study and may stop the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds. 
 The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or it may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials in the U.S. typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and 4. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a small number of healthy volunteers to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. Follow-on Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants. 
 In Phase 2 clinical trials, the investigational product is usually tested on a limited number of patients (generally up to several hundred) to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 In Phase 3 clinical trials, the investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to confirm proof of concept and efficacy claims, provide evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple clinical sites.
 In Phase 4 clinical trials or other post-approval commitments, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA may require a commitment to conduct post-approval Phase 4 studies as a condition of approval. Additional studies and follow-up may be conducted to document a clinical benefit where drugs are approved under accelerated approval regulations and based on surrogate endpoints. In clinical trials, surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms. Failure to timely conduct Phase 4 clinical trials and follow-up could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 
 
14 


 Clinical Data Review and Approval in the U.S. 
 The data from the clinical trials, together with preclinical data and other supporting information that establishes a drug candidates safety, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, or NDA supplement (for approval of a new indication if the product candidate is already approved for another indication). Under applicable laws and FDA regulations, the FDA reviews the NDA within 60 days of receipt of the NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDAs threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If deemed complete, the FDA will file the NDA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application. The FDA can refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable. 
 The FDA has established internal substantive review goals of ten months for most NDAs. The FDA has various programs, including Breakthrough, Fast Track, Priority Review, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval based on surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority Review designation, which is requested at the time of an NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and Priority Review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for Priority Review. Accelerated approval provides an expedited approval of drugs that treat serious diseases and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. The FDA, however, is not legally required to complete its review within these periods, and these performance goals may change over time. 
 If the FDA approves the NDA, it will issue an approval letter authorizing the commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In many cases, the outcome of the review, even if generally favorable, is not an actual approval, but a complete response that generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission, which may require substantial additional testing or information before the FDA will reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. 
 Satisfaction of FDA requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial financial resources. Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the process. Accordingly, the actual time and expense required to bring a product to market may vary substantially. Data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or have conditions placed on it that restrict the commercial applications, advertising, promotion or distribution of these products. 
 Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety or effectiveness of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. The FDA may also request or require additional Phase 4 clinical trials after a product is approved. The results of Phase 4 clinical trials can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDAs voluntary adverse drug reaction reporting system. Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements on us and our third-party manufacturers. 
 
15 


 In addition, both before and after approval is sought, we are required to comply with a number of FDA requirements. For example, we are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain limitations and other requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with continuing cGMP. In addition, discovery of problems, such as safety problems, may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or NDA holder, including removal of the product from the market. 
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. Approval may be subject to post-marketing surveillance and other record-keeping and reporting obligations, and involve ongoing requirements. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. 
 Clinical Trial Conduct and Product Approval Regulation in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions 
 In addition to regulations in the U.S., we may be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Our clinical trials conducted in the EU must be done under an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier, and the oversight of an ethics committee. If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our product candidates will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa. The process for clinical trials in the EU is similar, and trials are heavily scrutinized by the designated ethics committee. 
Section 505(b)(2) Applications 
 Some of our product candidates may be eligible for submission of applications for approval under the FDAs Section 505(b)(2) approval process, which provides an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, and allows approval of NDAs that rely, at least in part, on studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Such studies can be provided by published literature, or the FDA can rely on previous findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved drug. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDAs previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification (e.g., a new indication or new dosage form) of an eligible approved drug. In such cases, the additional information in 505(b)(2) applications necessary to support the change from the previously approved drug is frequently provided by new studies submitted by the applicant. Because a Section 505(b)(2) application relies in part on previous studies or previous FDA findings of safety and effectiveness, preparing 505(b)(2) applications is generally less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information from a full set of clinical trials. The FDA may approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The law governing Section 505(b)(2) or FDAs current policies may change in such a way as to adversely affect our applications for approval that seek to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) approach. Such changes could result in additional costs associated with additional studies or clinical trials and delays. 
 The FDA provides that reviews and/or approvals of applications submitted under Section 505(b)(2) will be delayed in various circumstances. For example, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of market exclusivity during which the FDA will not approve, and may not even review, a Section 505(b)(2) application from other sponsors. If the listed drug is claimed by one or more patents that the NDA holder has listed with the FDA, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit a certification with respect to each such patent. If the 505(b)(2) applicant certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the product that is the subject of the Section 505(b)(2) application, it must notify the patent holder and the NDA holder. If, within 45 days of providing this notice, the NDA holder sues the 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of a court decision favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant or the expiration of 30 months. The regulations governing marketing exclusivity and patent protection are complex, and it is often unclear how they will be applied in particular circumstances. 
 
16 


 Drug Enforcement Agency Regulation 
 Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals. Some of these hazardous materials are considered to be controlled substances and subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The CSA governs, among other things, the distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. We must be registered by the DEA in order to engage in these activities, and we are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEAs regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation, or a denial of renewal, of the DEA registration, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Commercial success of SUSTOL, CINVANTI and any of our other product candidates that are approved or commercialized for any indication will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies and managed care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the U.S. may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include: 
 

 | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program or requiring that new or additional rebates be provided to Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reforming drug importation laws.
--+---------------------------------

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. 
 Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the U.S., the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit widespread use and lower potential product revenues. 
 Anti-Kickback, Fraud and Abuse and False Claims Regulation 
 We are subject to health care fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of SUSTOL, CINVANTI and any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. 
 
17 


 Regulations under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the federal health care programs Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral or purchase of any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors. In addition, the False Claims Act (FCA) imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. 
 The risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened many of these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, PPACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. 
 The continuing interpretation and application of these laws could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to compete should we commence marketing a product. 
 Federal and State Sunshine Laws 
 We must comply with federal sunshine laws, now known as Open Payments that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with health care providers. This would include the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any payment or transfer of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information can result in civil monetary penalties. A number of states have laws that require the implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report payments, gifts and other benefits provided to physicians and other health care professionals and entities. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (FCPA). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
 
18 


 Patient Privacy and Data Security 
 We are required to comply, as applicable, with numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, and to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union that became effective in May 2018. In addition, most healthcare providers who prescribe SUSTOL or CINVANTI or who may prescribe other products we may sell in the future and from whom we may obtain patient health information are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations. We are not a HIPAA covered entity, do not intend to become one, and we do not operate as a business associate to any covered entities. Therefore, these privacy and security requirements do not apply to us. However, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business, and any failure to comply could result in harm to our reputation, and potentially fines and penalties. 
 In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Environmental, Health and Safety Laws 
 Our operations are subject to complex and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Further, in the future, we may open manufacturing facilities that would likely be subject to environmental and health and safety authorities in the relevant jurisdictions. These authorities typically administer laws which regulate, among other matters, the emission of pollutants into the air (including the workplace), the discharge of pollutants into bodies of water, the storage, use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances, the exposure of persons to hazardous substances, and the general health, safety and welfare of employees and members of the public. Violations of these laws could subject us to strict liability, fines or liability to third parties. 
Other Laws 
 We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of The Nasdaq Capital Market, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. 
Employees 
 As of February 1, 2019, we had 198 full-time employees; 103 are involved in research and development activities, 68 are involved in sales and marketing activities and 27 are involved in administration, human resources, finance, legal and information technology. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and management considers relations with our employees to be good. 
Company Information 
 We were founded in February 1983 as a California corporation under the name AMCO Polymerics, Inc. (AMCO). AMCO changed its name to Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (APS) in 1984 and was reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1987. APS changed its name to A.P. Pharma, Inc. (APP) in May 2001. In January 2014, APP changed its name to Heron Therapeutics, Inc.
