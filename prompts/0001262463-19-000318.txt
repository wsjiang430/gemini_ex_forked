Organizational History and General Background of the Registrant
 
The Company was incorporated in Florida in 1995 for the purpose of designing and manufacturing heat pump pool heaters, residential air conditioners and parallel flow coils for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. In June 2002, the Registrant and its subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida. The Company emerged from bankruptcy in March 2004 free and clear of all liens, claims and obligations. On July 17, 2017, Peregrine Industries, Inc., (the "Registrant") issued a total of 22,477,843 or 97.7% of the issued common restricted shares of the Registrant's common stock, par value $0.0001 (the "Shares") to Dolomite Holdings Ltd., organized under the laws of the State of Israel and the corporate parent and principal shareholder of the Registrant ("Dolomite"). The Shares were issued upon the conversion by Dolomite, effective July 14, 2017, of principal and accrued interest owed by the Registrant to Dolomite evidenced by convertible notes and other short-term debt in the aggregate amount of $443,718, representing all of the liabilities of the Registrant at its fiscal year-ended June 30, 2017. The fair value of the shares was deemed to be the carrying value of the principal and accrued interest, $443,718. Dolomite was a related party therefore the settlement had no gain or loss. The issuance of the Shares was made in reliance upon the exemptions provided in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and Regulation S promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). . Effective July 21, 2017, Dolomite sold, transferred and assigned the total of 22,477,843 restricted shares of the Registrant's common stock, to four persons, none of whom were affiliated with the Registrant or with Dolomite. The 22,477,843 Shares represented in excess of 97% of the Registrant's total issued and outstanding Shares at July 21, 2017, resulting in a change of control of the Company.
 
The new management has developed a business plan which they anticipate implementing within the current fiscal year.

Business Objectives of the Registrant
 The Registrant has no present operations, but, the new management has a business plan which it intends to pursue during the coming fiscal year. The Company has selected a target business on which to concentrate and plans to implement a business combination, unless Management determines that such transaction is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in the Company's common stock to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the particular industry in which it operates. To the extent we effect a business combination with a company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of an early stage or potential emerging growth company.
