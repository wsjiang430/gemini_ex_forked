Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biotechnology company, focused on leveraging artificial intelligence (“A.I.”), machine learning and genomic data to streamline the drug development process and to identify the patients that will benefit from our targeted oncology therapies. Our portfolio of therapies consists of small molecules that others have tried, but failed, to develop into an approved commercialized drug, as well as new compounds that we are developing with the assistance of our proprietary A.I. platform and our biomarker driven approach. Our A.I. platform, known as RADR®, currently includes more than 25 billion data points, and uses big data analytics (combining molecular data, drug efficacy data, data from historical studies, data from scientific literature, phenotypic data from trials and publications, and mechanistic pathway data) and machine learning to rapidly uncover biologically relevant genomic signatures correlated to drug response, and then identify the cancer patients that we believe may benefit most from our compounds. This data-driven, genomically-targeted and biomarker-driven approach allows us to pursue a transformational drug development strategy that identifies, rescues or develops, and advances potential small molecule drug candidates at what we believe is a fraction of the time and cost associated with traditional cancer drug development.
 
Our strategy is to both develop new drug candidates using our RADR® platform and other machine learning driven methodologies, and to pursue the development of drug candidates that have undergone previous clinical trial testing or that may have been halted in development or deprioritized because of insufficient clinical trial efficacy (i.e., a meaningful treatment benefit relevant for the disease or condition under study as measured against the comparator treatment used in the relevant clinical testing) or for strategic reasons by the owner or development team responsible for the compound. Importantly, these historical drug candidates appear to have been well-tolerated in many instances, and often have considerable data from previous toxicity, tolerability and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) studies that have been completed. Additionally, these drug candidates may also have a body of existing data supporting the potential mechanism(s) by which they achieve their intended biologic effect, but often require more targeted trials in a stratified group of patients to demonstrate statistically meaningful results. Our dual approach to both develop de-novo, biomarker-guided drug candidates and “rescue” historical drug candidates by leveraging A.I., recent advances in genomics, computational biology and cloud computing is emblematic of a new era in drug development that is being driven by data-intensive approaches meant to de-risk development and accelerate the clinical trial process. In this context, we intend to create a diverse portfolio of oncology drug candidates for further development towards regulatory and marketing approval with the objective of establishing a leading A.I.-driven, methodology for treating the right patient with the right oncology therapy.
 
A key component of our strategy is to target specific cancer patient populations and treatment indications identified by leveraging our RADR® platform, a proprietary A.I. enabled engine created and owned by us. We believe the combination of our therapeutic area expertise, our A.I. expertise, and our ability to identify and develop promising drug candidates through our collaborative relationships with research institutions in selected areas of oncology gives us a significant competitive advantage. Our RADR® platform was developed and refined over the last five years and integrates billions of data points immediately relevant for oncology drug development and patient response prediction using artificial intelligence and proprietary machine learning algorithms. By identifying clinical candidates, together with relevant genomic and phenotypic data, we believe our approach will help us design more efficient preclinical studies, and more targeted clinical trials, thereby accelerating our drug candidates’ time to approval and eventually to market. Although we have not yet applied for or received regulatory or marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we believe our RADR® platform has the ability to reduce the cost and time to bring drug candidates to specifically targeted patient groups. We believe we have developed a sustainable and scalable biopharma business model by combining a unique, oncology-focused big-data platform that leverages artificial intelligence along with active clinical and preclinical programs that are being advanced in targeted cancer therapeutic areas to address today’s treatment needs.

Scientific literature offers a definition for “drug rescue” as research involving abandoned small molecules and biologics that have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). These rescued molecular compounds are often abandoned by pharmaceutical companies in the drug discovery or preclinical testing phase, typically because they do not prove effective for the specific use for which they were developed. Some of these compounds may be useful in treating other diseases for which they have not been tested. See, Hemphill, Thomas A., “The NIH Promotes Drug Repurposing and Rescue,” Research Technology Management, v. 5, no. 5, pp. 6-8 (2012). Our use of the term “rescue”, “drug rescue”, or “drug rescuing” refers to, “…a system of developing new uses for chemical and biological entities that previously were investigated in clinical studies but not further developed or submitted for regulatory approval, or had to be removed from the market for safety reasons.”, which is a definition we believe is recognized in the drug discovery, drug development and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. See, Naylor, S. and Schonfeld J., “Therapeutic Drug Repurposing, Repositioning and Rescue,” DDW (Drug Discovery World) Winter 2014, and Mucke, HAM, A New Journal for the Drug Repurposing Community. Drug Repurposing, Rescue & Repositioning 1, 3-4 (2014). The use of the term “drug rescue,” “rescuing,” or words of similar meaning in this report should not be construed to mean that our RADR® platform has resolved all issues of safety and/or efficacy for any of our drug candidates. Issues of safety and efficacy for any drug candidate may only be determined by the U.S. FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States.
 
Our current portfolio consists of four compounds and an Antibody Drug Conjugate (ADC) program: two drug candidates in clinical phases, two in the pre-IND preclinical stage and our ADC program in research optimization. All of these drug candidates and our ADC program are leveraging precision oncology, A.I. and genomic driven approaches to accelerate and direct development efforts.
 
We currently have two drug candidates in clinical development, LP-100 and LP-300, where we are leveraging data from prior preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with insights generated from our A.I. platform, to target the types of tumors and patient groups we believe will be most responsive to the drug. Both LP-100 and LP-300 showed promise in important patient subgroups, but failed pivotal Phase III trials when the overall results did not meet the predefined clinical endpoints. We believe that this was due to a lack of biomarker-driven patient stratification. LP-300 has been studied in multiple randomized, controlled, multi-center non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, trials that included administration of either paclitaxel and cisplatin and/or docetaxel and cisplatin, and we are currently conducting a targeted phase II trial (the Harmonic™ trial) for LP-300 in never smoking patients with NSCLC in combination with chemotherapy, under an existing investigational new drug application. LP-100 was previously out-licensed by us to Allarity Therapeutics A/S. In July 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to reacquire global development and commercialization rights for LP-100 from Allarity.
 
Additionally, we have two new drug candidates, LP-184 and LP-284, in pre-IND preclinical development for multiple potentially distinct indications where we are leveraging machine learning and genomic data to streamline the drug development process and to identify the patients and cancer subtypes that will best benefit from these drugs, if approved. Subject to regulatory clearance to move forward under future IND applications, we are planning a Phase I clinical trial for LP-184 to begin in mid 2023 and a Phase I clinical trial for LP-284 to begin in mid 2023. Our ADC program commenced in early 2021 is aimed at identifying targeted or therapeutic antibodies to conjugate with selected compounds. In January 2023, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Starlight Therapeutics Inc. (“Starlight”), to develop drug candidate LP-184’s central nervous system (CNS) and brain cancer indications – including glioblastoma (GBM), brain metastases (brain mets.), and several rare pediatric CNS cancers. Following the formation of Starlight, we will refer to the molecule LP-184, as it is developed in CNS indications, as “STAR-001”.
 
Our development strategy is to pursue an increasing number of oncology focused, molecularly targeted therapies where artificial intelligence and genomic data can help us provide biological insights, reduce the risk associated with development efforts and help clarify potential patient response. We plan on strategically evaluating these on a program-by-program basis as they advance into clinical development, either to be done entirely by us or with out-licensing partners to maximize the commercial opportunity and reduce the time it takes to bring the right drug to the right patient.

As part of our overall growth strategy, we plan to grow our pipeline by identifying new drug candidates and pursuing potential indications for LP-300, LP-184, LP-284, and LP-100 while leveraging our RADR® platform. We are also pursuing the identification and design of potential combination therapies in cancer for our compounds by leveraging our RADR® platform to analyze synergistic genomic networks and biological pathways with other currently approved drugs.
 
We have an extensive multi-national portfolio of intellectual property directed to our drug candidates, and to protect the targeted use and development of our portfolio of compounds in specific patient populations and in specific therapeutic indications. In addition, as our RADR® platform and other machine learning driven methodologies progress and mature, we will continue to evaluate additional ways to further protect these assets.
 
As of March 1, 2023, we own or control over 80 active patents and patent applications across over 16 patent families whose claims are directed to our drug candidates and what we plan to do with our drug candidates. We have in-licensed or acquired patents and patent applications from AF Chemicals, and BioNumerik that are directed to the compounds, LP-100, LP-184, LP-284 and LP-300, and methods of using the compounds. Additionally, we have also filed patent applications to further enhance, and extend the use of these in-licensed compounds. Our 14 patent families are directed to our drug candidates, their usage, manufacturing and other matters. These matters are essential to precision oncology and relate to: (a) data-driven, biologically relevant biomarker signatures, (b) patient selection and stratification approaches that rely on prediction of response derived from these signatures and, (c) the ability to develop novel, combination therapy approaches with existing therapeutics.
 
Our Drug Candidate Pipeline
 
One of the ways we are building our drug candidate pipeline is by in-licensing clinical stage drug candidates that may have been discontinued for development. We use our RADR® platform to assist in analyzing prior clinical research conducted by others to identify small-molecule oncology drug candidates that have (i) a well-tolerated profile evidenced by completion of phase I clinical trials, and (ii) demonstrated at least limited antitumor or anticancer activity in clinical trials. We intend to advance the drug candidates in our pipeline as potential precision medicine treatments for cancer. Our targeted development workflow includes preclinical studies where drug activity and associated gene signatures are identified, in part through strategic collaborations with some of the top academic institutions and clinical translational centers in the world. Using this collaborative approach, together with innovative observations from our RADR® platform, we intend to develop and add drug candidates to our pipeline with the objective of treating the right patient populations with the right oncology therapies.

Our Precision Cancer Therapy Development Using Our Innovative RADR® Platform
 
RADR® is one of the world’s largest A.I. and machine learning (M.L.) oncology drug discovery and development platforms, consisting of over 25+ billion oncology-focused data points. These data points consist of large-scale multi-omic data, derived from 130,000+ patient records, 150+ drug-tumor interactions, thousands of drug classes, and covering over 135 cancer subtypes. RADR® leverages this data and over 200+ advanced ML algorithms to power its drug discovery and development modules. RADR®’s data, capabilities, and insights have powered the development of new Lantern drug candidates, advancement of new indications for existing drugs, and identification of potential new drug combinations.
 
Historically, cancer treatment protocols include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Treatments have been selected based on histologic type and disease spread, irrespective of genetic differences among patients. With the advent of precision therapies, cancer treatments increasingly target specific genes or mechanisms of action for a more personalized approach to patient care. This trend represents a substantial advance in cancer treatment because tumor growth is highly dependent on genetic changes and the genetic profile of the individual and the progression of the disease is highly variable amongst patients.
 
Our RADR® platform is core to our drug development approach for identifying the desired candidates to in-license and develop. According to a recent article in JAMA (Estimated Research and Development Investment Needed to Bring a New Medicine to Market, 2009-18, JAMA, March 3, 2020) oncology drug development is costly, risky, and highly competitive with an average success rate of 4% to 8% and average developmental costs of over $1 billion per successful drug. There is a critical need to rescue clinical research on drugs that have failed clinical trials in order to provide additional possible therapies for patients while reducing the overall cost of therapeutic development. Many drug failures within oncology may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the tested patient population, even though there may be a strongly positive therapeutic impact on certain patient subgroups within that population.
 
As data-centric and machine learning approaches begin to change the pace and scale of drug discovery and development, research and development (“R&D”) we believe efforts in large biopharma companies will begin to shift away from traditional approaches towards new data and A.I.-centric approaches. According to Deloitte Consulting, in Ten Years On | Measuring the return from pharmaceutical innovation 2019, “decades of advances in science and technology have driven improvements in health care outcomes and influenced stakeholder expectations of the role of the biopharmaceutical industry (biopharma). However, the past decade has seen increasing pressures undermine the productivity of biopharma R&D, leading to multiple years of decline in the return on investment. At the same time, innovative new treatments are changing the face of disease management. New treatment modalities and an increasing understanding of precision medicine have led to the need for new R&D models...” The Deloitte Consulting report further describes that R&D costs will, “shift from traditional discovery and trial execution to a process driven by large datasets, advanced computing power and cloud storage”.
 
Analysts estimate that this shift from traditional screening, and trial-based studies to leveraging in silico, data and A.I. methodologies has driven a significant increase in the spending on A.I. by the biopharma and drug discovery community to approximately $4 billion in 2021, increasing by about 40% annually from $730 million in 2019 according to PMLive and Global Market Insights. As a result of these trends and changes in the R&D model in biopharma, we believe that we, and companies that are using data-centric and A.I. centric approaches to drug discovery and development, are in an ideal position to benefit from this industry shift that has the potential to help deliver drugs to the right patients faster, with a higher degree of personalization and a potentially lower amount of average costs in the development cycle.
 
Our drug rescue approach leverages substantial prior research and development investments in candidates that were withdrawn from development prior to submission for FDA approval. The large volume of failed compounds, recent developments that permit increased access to validated genomic and biomarker data, and the rapid evolution of A.I. technology creates an opportunity to efficiently capitalize on these investments.

Our RADR® platform is rapidly emerging as a robust and scalable platform for targeted cancer therapy development. Through the use of A.I. and machine learning, RADR® is designed to quickly identify and guide the development of compounds that we can develop as potential oncology agents through either a process of drug rescue, drug repositioning or de-novo development. RADR® is being developed through an accumulation and curation of genomic and biomarker data that is directly relevant to the measurement and classification drug-tumor interaction, and clinical datapoints related to patient response and patient stratification.
 
Predicting optimal drug responses in cancer patients requires the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers. Our RADR® platform seeks to identify biomarkers to assist in selecting patients who have the highest likelihood to respond to our drug candidates. For example, the targeted indications for our drug candidate LP-184 were chosen in part because they are known to highly express the protein coding gene PTGR1. Our planned clinical trial for LP-184 is intended to provide additional information regarding biomarkers related to LP-184’s molecular and cellular targets. This method of using and validating targeted biomarkers during development and then using these biomarkers during clinical trials can lead to shortening of the development timeline and compression of costs associated with oncology drug development.
 
Similarly, we believe LP-300 targets molecular pathways that are more common in never smokers than in other groups and also targets kinases involved in key signaling pathways involving enzymes critical for DNA synthesis and repair, such as Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1 (ERCC1), Ribonucleotide Reductase 1 (RNR1), Ribonucleotide Reductase 2 (RNR2), as well as enzymes and proteins important in regulating cell redox status, such as Thioredoxin (TRX), Peroxiredoxin (PRX), Glutaredoxin (GRX), and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI).
 
Our RADR® Platform
 
The human genome consists of 19,000 to 20,000 protein coding genes. One input record derived from available data bases and analyzed by our RADR® platform consists of datapoints (expression values) from approximately 20,000 genes, another input record type is drug sensitivity data (IC20, IC50), and other sets include key clinical parameters from HIPAA compliant patient data and clinical histories. Our RADR® platform uses a data-driven gene feature selection methodology that is a combination of biology, informatics, and statistics – computational biology. The architecture, tools and software of our platform are depicted in the figures below.

We developed our platform using primarily open-source third party supervised algorithms such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Penalized Multivariate Regression. Each algorithm is trained with input data to predict drug sensitivity (regressor models) and stratify patient response as responder or non-responder (classifier models). Model tuning and optimization is then performed using a hyperparameter search algorithm in order to produce the predicted lowest cross validation error. The models are then evaluated using traditional performance metrics such as accuracy, area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, precision, root mean square error and mean absolute error calculations.
 
A feature reduction algorithm is then used to reduce the number of genes under analysis to a biomarker gene panel of less than approximately 50 genes. This set of genes is intended to carry the highest coefficient to predict drug sensitivity and the highest variable importance in classifying a responder from a non-responder. Genes that do not help in predicting the output variable are eliminated sequentially.
 

Our RADR® Platform Workflow
 
Our RADR® platform’s proprietary workflow involves preliminary statistical analysis on approximately 18,000 features typically from whole transcriptomic datasets reducing the set to approximately 2,000 features. This is followed by gene filtering via biological and statistical methodologies yielding approximately 200 significant genes. The platform currently contains 6 feature selection methods and 13 machine learning methods to analyze the drug and omics data, in order to fine tune the model and get better and improved prediction accuracy. Feature selection ensures that genes that do not contribute to response prediction are excluded from the output dataset. The prediction component subsequently applies an A.I.-driven reduction algorithm to the previously filtered genes generating a targeted set of typically less than 50 candidate biomarkers predictive of response to a particular molecule. The figure below illustrates RADR®’s workflow.
 

A distinct and unique benefit of the RADR® platform is its ability to integrate biological knowledge and data-driven feature selection to generate hypothesis-free biomarker signatures. This can then aid in identifying novel targets for predictive screening and drug development.

Our RADR® platform is enabled through access to, and analysis of, a number of key datasets: (i) publicly available databases (ii) data from commercial clinical studies and trials and (iii) our proprietary data generated from ex vivo 3D tumor models specific to drug-tumor interactions. We incorporate automated supervised machine learning strategies along with big data analytics, statistics and systems biology to facilitate identification of new correlations of genetic biomarkers with drug activity.
 
The value of the platform architecture is derived from its validation through the analysis of over 25 billion oncology-specific clinical and preclinical data points, more than 154 drug-cancer interactions, thousands of drug classes, data covering more than 135 cancer subtypes, and over 130,000 patient records from 16 databases, one of which is our internal database. RADR® leverages this data and over 200+ advanced ML algorithms to power its drug discovery and development modules. Our long-term objective is to collect and analyze over 100 billion oncology-specific clinical and preclinical data points to further enhance the prediction power of our RADR® platform. We use cancer cell line gene expression profiles and drug sensitivity data (IC50) as one of its input types. In a population of 10 case studies our platform was able to distinguish responders from non-responders with an average historical accuracy of over 80%. We have also used our platform to generate genetic signatures that we believe to have applicability for the majority of FDA approved drug-tumor indications. External validation, through retrospective data analysis, of patient datasets from 10 independent clinical studies achieved an average response prediction accuracy greater than 80%, and internal analysis of 120 drug-tumor interactions in cell lines achieved an accuracy of greater than 85%. The figure below illustrates examples of RADR®’s algorithms and how they can be used.
 

We have developed our platform in a cloud environment that efficiently uses parallel processing to analyze patient stratification and biomarker selection. Best software engineering practices are followed while designing and developing our platform’s architecture. In order to track modifications in the software, a version control system is in place. We use a software release process, including a rigorous regression testing process, to ensure functions and programs are working as designed.

Our platform uses a simple user input and GUI based AI architecture that can be used in many pharmaceutical research areas such as biomarker identification, patient stratification, drug rescue and reposition by bioinformaticians, clinicians and trained wet-lab scientists.
 
In late 2021, the Code Ocean Platform, a secure cloud-based computing environment manager, was integrated into RADR®. The Code Ocean environment has upgraded RADR®’s data organization, synchronization, scalability and accessibility. These architecture changes have enhanced the reproducibility of RADR® aided insights and analysis and created an environment that improves the ability to collaborate and share insights within Lantern and with Lantern’s collaborators. The figure below illustrates ways that RADR®’s modules can be used to facilitate drug discovery and development within Lantern and with our collaborators.
 

Actuate Therapeutics Collaboration Utilizing RADR Platform
 
In May 2021, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Actuate Therapeutics, Inc. (“Actuate”), a clinical stage private biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of compounds for use in the treatment of cancer, and inflammatory diseases leading to fibrosis. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, we are collaborating with Actuate on utilization of our RADR® platform to develop novel biomarker derived signatures for use with one of Actuate’s product candidates. As part of the collaboration, we received 25,000 restricted shares of Actuate stock subject to meeting certain conditions of the collaboration, as well as the potential to receive additional Actuate stock if results from the collaboration are utilized in future development efforts.
TTC Oncology Collaboration to Expand the Clinical Development of Drug Candidate TTC-352
 
In February 2023, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with TTC Oncology (“TTC”). The collaboration is focused on using RADR® to accelerate and sharpen the drug development of TTC’s Phase 2 ready drug candidate TTC-352. TTC-352, is a novel, first- and best-in-class selective human estrogen receptor (ER) partial agonist (ShERPA) for the treatment of patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer. TTC-352 was recently evaluated in a Phase 1 accelerated dose escalation study for hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer, and it showed early efficacy signals in heavily pretreated hormone refractory patients. The initial aims of the collaboration are to 1) identify biomarker or gene signatures to power potential patient selection for an upcoming TTC-352 Phase 2 clinical trial, 2) further characterize TTC-352’s mechanism of action, and 3) discover additional treatment indications for TTC-352. Under the terms of the collaboration, Lantern is receiving an exclusive right to license TTC-352, including any collaboration intellectual property (“IP”), during an exclusive option period. Additionally, Lantern and TTC will each participate in upfront, milestone, and royalty payments in the event a third-party licenses IP resulting from the collaboration.

Our Strategy
 
Our mission is to bring the right cancer drugs to the right patients by transforming the drug development process through the use of artificial intelligence and data-driven development approaches. Our proprietary A.I.-enabled, and precision oncology approach, which focuses on developing our own pipeline of compounds by rescuing drug candidates that have previously failed and developing new compounds that are targeted to specific biological activity and genomic pathways, has the potential, we believe, to bring drugs to market faster, with lower costs, and with reduced risk, thereby enabling a change in the cost and availability of precision cancer therapy. We work with leading research laboratories, translational medicine and cancer centers to develop our studies and clinical trials for our portfolio, and actively update and improve our RADR® platform to incorporate additional biomarker data, patient outcome data, cancer drug efficacy studies and computational models that relate to oncology drug development and prediction of patient response.
 
As part of our growth strategy, we plan to:
 

● | Pursue existing indications for LP-300, LP-184, LP-284 and LP-100, leveraging our RADR® platform to refine and optimize our trial design and biomarker signatures that correlate to potential patient response. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Expand our pipeline by identifying new drug candidates that have either been abandoned or have failed in late stage clinical trials, and have the potential to benefit from a precision medicine approach that leverages our expertise and A.I. platform. 
● | Identify and design potential combination therapy approaches to use our compounds in conjunction with currently approved drugs by leveraging our RADR® platform to analyze and uncover synergistic mechanisms and biological pathways using genomics and machine learning.

LP-300
 
General Overview
 
We are currently advancing LP-300 in a Phase II clinical trial (the “HARMONIC™ Study”) of LP-300 in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in never smoker patients with relapsed advanced primary adenocarcinoma of the lung after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
 
LP-300 is a cysteine-modifying molecular entity that works to modulate multiple cellular pathways simultaneously and is a potential combination agent for targeted indications in NSCLC. LP-300 is a small molecule (molecular weight 326.4 Da) that was in-licensed from BioNumerik Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in May 2016, and subsequently acquired by us in 2018. We are focused on repositioning LP-300 as a potential combination therapy for never smokers NSCLC patients with histologically defined adenocarcinoma. Prior clinical trials conducted by BioNumerik for LP-300 did not meet their primary clinical endpoints, and at least one or more future clinical trials that meet their pre-specified primary endpoints with statistical significance will be required before we can obtain a regulatory marketing approval, if any, to commercialize LP-300. Safety and efficacy determinations are solely within the authority of the FDA in the U.S. or other regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. Currently there is no approved therapy specifically for the growing indication of never-smokers with NSCLC, and female never smokers appear to be uniquely responsive to LP-300. With both chemosensitizing and chemoprotective activity, LP-300 has potential as a combination agent or adjuvant in front line, second line or salvage therapy in newly diagnosed, relapsed, metastatic or advanced NSCLC for overall survival enhancement and toxicity alleviation from primary chemotherapy or standard of care. We are currently in the early stages of defining a specific biomarker signature that correlates with heightened sensitivity to LP-300. We believe that this signature may help accelerate the clinical development of LP-300 and has the potential to guide patient selection for targeted clinical trials.
 
Prior clinical trials conducted by BioNumerik for LP-300 did not meet their primary clinical endpoints and at least one or more future clinical trials that meet their pre-specified primary endpoints with statistical significance will be required before we can obtain a regulatory marketing approval, if any, to commercialize LP-300. Prior clinical trial observations are not necessarily predictive of the outcome of any future clinical trials we may conduct.
 
LP-300 has been administered in multiple clinical trials to more than 1,000 subjects and has been generally well-tolerated. Retrospective analyses of the results of a multi-country phase III lung cancer trial (study ID DMS32212R) in subgroups of adenocarcinoma patients receiving LP-300, paclitaxel and cisplatin demonstrated substantial improvement in overall survival, particularly among female never smokers, where a 13.6 month improvement in overall survival (p-value 0.0167, hazard ratio 0.367) in favor of LP-300 was observed, as compared to placebo in the subgroup of paclitaxel/cisplatin-treated patients. Similar retrospective findings of increased overall survival in the subgroup of LP-300/paclitaxel/cisplatin treated female Asian patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were observed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in Japan. Prior historical clinical trial observations are not necessarily predictive of the outcome of future trials. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining marketing approval for LP-300. The chemical structure of LP-300 is depicted below.

LP-300 Phase II Clinical Trial
 
We are conducting a Phase II clinical trial (the “HARMONIC™ Study”) of LP-300 in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed in never smoker patients with relapsed advanced primary adenocarcinoma of the lung after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our purpose in conducting the study is to determine the potential clinical advantages for this drug combination in the study-defined patient population. As of the date of this report, we have activated 5 clinical trial sites in the US, across 12 locations, and we anticipate multiple additional sites in the US during the first half of 2023, with first enrolled patients anticipated in the second quarter of 2023.
 
The trial is designed as a multicenter, open label, Phase II trial with planned enrollment of approximately 90 patients. Patients who are never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and have relapsed after prior treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors will be eligible for enrollment. Following a six-patient safety lead-in stage, the trial consists of randomization in a 2:1 allocation ratio to one of two arms: Arm A (consisting of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and LP-300) or Arm B (consisting of carboplatin and pemetrexed).
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine progression-free survival and overall survival in the study-defined patient population when co-administered LP-300 with combination chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) versus carboplatin and pemetrexed alone. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate tumor response measured by objective response rate, duration of objective response, and clinical benefit rate. We will also determine any associations between the efficacy endpoints and patient biomarkers (e.g., circulating tumor DNA and tumor genome characteristics) as an exploratory objective. Other exploratory objectives for the study may include evaluating quality of life in all patients and performance of patients based on the type, duration, and number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors received.
 
Key Findings from Prior LP-300 Clinical Trials
 
Summarized below are some key findings from LP-300’s prior clinical trials:
 

● | LP-300 targets molecular pathways that are more common in female non-smokers than in any other group. Key mechanisms have been elucidated to support LP-300’s role in the observed treatment benefits for females and never smokers noted in the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial. The rationale for these observations includes the following: (1) Met/ALK & EGFR alterations are more common in non-smokers, who are most commonly female and present with advanced stage adenocarcinoma; (2) laboratory data indicate that LP-300 targets both EGFR WT/mut+ and Met/ALK; and (3) a high percentage of adenocarcinoma patients are either EGFR mutants or Met/ALK positive. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | There are several key pathways in NSCLC adenocarcinoma whose targets are often overexpressed in females, and LP-300 modulates these pathways. LP-300 targets the following key pathways: (1) kinases involved in key signaling pathways (ALK, ROS, MET); (2) enzymes critical for DNA synthesis and repair (ERCC1, RNR1, RNR2); and (3) enzymes and proteins important in regulating cell redox status (TRX, PRX, GRX, PDI). The alterations that are targeted and modulated by LP-300 are more likely in women with lung adenocarcinoma, especially non-smokers. 
● | LP-300 showed that females had a survival increase from 13 months to 25 months, based on a retrospective subgroup analysis of a Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial. Results from a Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial exhibited an overall survival of 25.0 months, with a 2-year survival of 51.4%, in the subgroup of females with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung receiving paclitaxel/cisplatin and LP-300. The observed results were statistically significant (p-value = 0.0477; HR=0.579) and were observed in a subgroup of 114 patients in retrospective analyses. Consistent statistically significant retrospective subgroup analysis results were observed in female NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients receiving paclitaxel/cisplatin and LP-300 in a prior LP-300 double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial conducted in Japan. 
● | LP-300 exhibits potential to reduce anemia and protect against chemotherapy-induced kidney toxicity, both of which are conditions that disproportionately affect females. The LP-300 arm of the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial also demonstrated the potential for LP-300 to protect against chemotherapy-induced kidney toxicity and anemia. These findings complement earlier clinical observations regarding LP-300’s potential to protect against neuropathy and other chemotherapy-induced toxicities.

Background-Scope of Prior Phase III NSCLC Adenocarcinoma Trial (LP-300)
 
LP-300 was studied in a randomized, multi-center (trial locations in four US states and five European countries), double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase III trial from 2010 to 2013 in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung (the “Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial”). The aim of the trial was to determine whether LP-300, combined with a standard combination of chemotherapy drugs, would increase survival in patients with advanced NSCLC adenocarcinoma. The secondary aim of the trial was to determine if the chemoprotective properties of LP-300 were effective in preventing or reducing common side-effects of cancer treatment, including kidney damage, anemia, nausea and vomiting that can occur with these drug combinations. The trial enrolled NSCLC patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent advanced (stage IIIB/IV) primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. Patients with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of inoperable and measurable advanced primary adenocarcinoma (including bronchioalveolar cell carcinoma) of the lung, and no prior systemic treatment for NSCLC including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapies or investigational drugs, were included in the trial. Overall survival was the primary outcome measure. Patients in the control arm received standard of care (cisplatin and either paclitaxel or docetaxel) plus placebo, whereas patients in the treatment arm received standard of care (cisplatin and either paclitaxel or docetaxel) plus LP-300. The primary results of the trial for patients receiving cisplatin and paclitaxel are outlined in the table below. While the overall results of the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial did not meet the specified endpoint of the trial in increasing overall survival in all patients, when the data were retrospectively separated by gender and smoking status, the trial data demonstrated that all never smokers, especially female never smokers, saw increased survival with LP-300 combination treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin. Furthermore, the LP-300 group in the phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial exhibited well-tolerated advantages relating to the potential to protect against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity, neuropathy and nausea along with reduced anemia.
 


The figure below depicts the survival curves for cisplatin/paclitaxel subgroups for the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial that ended in 2013, as summarized. The Kaplan Meier curves maintain consistent separation between treatment arms for the never smokers, females, and female never smokers.
 

Rationale Behind LP-300 Rescue and Repositioning Efforts
 
Based on the results from the prior Phase III NSCL adenocarcinoma trial, we have launched the HARMONIC™ LP-300 Phase II clinical trial to target the subpopulation of never smokers with adenocarcinoma that saw strong benefit in the previous Phase III trial. Although the incidence of never-smokers with NSCLC is rising currently there is no approved therapy specifically for the growing indication of never-smokers with NSCLC. Preclinical observations support that LP-300 preferentially modulates ALK and EGFR, two commonly mutated genes in non-smokers with adenocarcinoma. Based on the findings from the previous Phase III NSCL adenocarcinoma trial, it is possible that the benefits of combining LP-300 with standard of care chemotherapy could be further improved by identifying additional molecular biomarkers in patients who respond well to LP-300 combination treatment. We continue to seek additional opportunities for LP-300. Some of our considerations include a never smoker population with a specific genetic signature that correlates to increased LP-300 sensitivity.

Disease Background and Opportunity 
 
Lung cancer remains one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide. Lung cancer accounts for 12% of all new cancer diagnoses, but 21% of all cancer deaths in the US. Lung cancer kills more people annually than cancers of the breast, prostate, colon, liver, kidney, pancreatic, and melanoma combined. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the US for 2023 are:

● | Approximately 238,340 new cases of lung cancer (117,550 in men and 120,790 in women) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Approximately 127,070 deaths from lung cancer (67,160 in men and 59,910 in women) 

 
The most common type of lung cancer is called non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”), which represents about 80% to 85% of all lung cancer.
 
Lung adenocarcinoma, a histological subtype of NSCLC that originates within the glands that line the lung, is the most common subtype of lung cancer in the world inflicting approximately 50% to 65% of non-Asians and approximately 70% to 85% of Asians diagnosed with lung cancer. According to LUNGevity Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and other published literature, 60% to 65% of all new lung cancer diagnoses are among people who are former smokers or have never smoked, while 10-15% of new lung cancer cases are among never-smokers.
 
Over one-half of the patients diagnosed with NSCLC in any given year will present with inoperable advanced (stage IV) disease, for which there is no cure. Patients with stage IV NSCLC exhibit a median overall survival time of 7 to 12 months; approximately one-third of patients will survive for a year, and only 10% to 21% of those patients will survive for two years.
 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of global cancer-related mortality, leading to over a million deaths each year and adenocarcinoma is its most common histological subtype. Worldwide, lung cancer occurred in approximately 2.2 million patients in 2020 and caused an estimated 1.8 million deaths. NSCLC is described as any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”). The 5-year survival rate for NSCLC is 25%.
 
Rapid advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of NSCLC have demonstrated that NSCLC is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Although the initial treatment of localized disease is the same, the molecular characterization of tumor tissue in patients with NSCLC serves as a guide to treatment both in those who present with metastatic disease and in those who relapse after primary therapy. Molecularly targeted therapies have dramatically improved treatment for patients whose tumors harbor somatically activated oncogenes such as mutant EGFR1 or translocated ALK, RET, or ROS1. Smoking is the major cause of lung adenocarcinoma but, as smoking rates decrease, proportionally more cases occur in never-smokers (defined as less than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime). KRAS mutations in lung cancer cases are nearly exclusive to smokers. KRAS, “Kristen rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog,” is a protein involved in regulating cell division. KRAS mutation is a gain-of-function mutation (i.e. somatic mutation turns RAS, a benign gene “proto-oncogene” into KRAS, an oncogenic driver of many tumors). KRAS-mutated non-small cell lung cancer represents 20% to 25% of all NSCLC. FDA granted accelerated approval to KRAS inhibitor sotorasib and Antibody Drug Conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu) for KRAS G12C -mutated and HER2 mutated advanced stages non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), respectively. In 2022, the combination of CTLA-4 inhibitor tremelimumab and the anti-PDL1 antibody durvalumab was approved by FDA for treating metastatic NSCLC patients lacking EGFR mutation or ALK translocation. Tumor suppressor gene abnormalities, such as those in TP53, CDKN2A8, KEAP1, and SMARCA4 are also common but are not currently clinically actionable.

In reviewing lung cancer incidence and mortality rates among never-smokers in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Wakelee, H.A. et al. have reported that the age-adjusted incidence rates of lung cancer among never-smokers aged 40 to 79 years from large population-based cohorts ranged from 14.4 to 20.8 per 100,000 person-years in women and 4.8 to 13.7 per 100,000 person-years in men, supporting earlier observations that women are more likely than men to have never smoking-associated lung cancer. The biology of lung cancer in never-smokers is apparent in differential responses to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors and an increased prevalence of adenocarcinoma histology in never-smokers. Lung cancer in never-smokers is an important public health issue needing further exploration of its incidence patterns, etiology, and biology. Due to the fact that there are no known therapy options for this group, we believe that aggressive development of therapy options is needed and is a high unmet clinical need.
 
In the US in 2023, there will be an estimated 12,000 diagnosed cases of NSCLC in female non-smokers, accounting for approximately 5% of all lung cancer cases. Globally in 2020, there were an estimated 111,583 adenocarcinoma cases of NSCLC in female non-smokers. Due to the specificity of this indication, it may be possible to classify it as a rare disease. When attempting to explain some gender susceptibility differences, research has demonstrated that women with NSCLC tend to be:
 

● | Younger; 
--+-----------------------------------------------
● | Asian; 
● | 2-3 times more likely to be non-smokers; 
● | more likely to develop adenocarcinoma and; 
● | more likely to have metastatic disease. 

 
The high rate of adenocarcinomas in non-smoking women suggests the possible existence of other etiological factors in addition to smoking. Some factors that have been considered include gender-specific genetic alterations and predispositions, passive smoke effects, different nicotine metabolism in women, occupational exposure, diet, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based upon estimates published by Global Cancer Statistics 2020 and 2023 estimates published by the American Cancer Society, below is an overview of relevant potential patient population and market sizes that we believe LP-300 could address, if approved:
 

Lung cancer | Global (2020) | | | US (2023)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+-----------+---+----------
Total lung cancer estimated incidence (new cases) | | 2,210,000 | | | 238,340 | 
NSCLC incidence (~85% of all lung cancer cases) | | 1,878,500 | | | 202,589 | 
NSCLC adenocarcinoma incidence (~60% of all NSCLC) | | 1,127,100 | | | 121,553 | 
Never-smokers estimate (~15% of adenocarcinoma) | | 169,065 | | | 18,233 | 
Female never-smoker estimate (~66% of never-smokers with lung cancer are female) | | 111,583 | | | 12,034 | 
Total Potential Patient Segment in New Lung Cancer | | 5 | % | | 5 | %

Limitations on Current Treatment
 
Treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC in the first-line setting usually includes chemotherapy (including taxanes, vinorelbine, or gemcitabine) in combination with a platinum doublet (cisplatin or carboplatin). According to the clinical practice guidelines published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, many of these combinations have reached a plateau in terms of overall response (≥ 25% to 35%), time to progression (four to six months), median survival time (eight to ten months), one-year survival rate (30% to 40%), and two-year survival rate (10% to 15%) in patients with good performance status. Treatment remains palliative and is limited due to inherent toxicities that may affect the quality of life resulting from treatment. Toxicities can be life-threatening or cause treatment delays, thereby limiting the intensity of treatment delivered and affecting its efficacy. Common and serious chemotherapy-induced toxicities, such as anemia, emesis, and peripheral neurotoxicity resulting from treatment with platinum and taxanes, and nephrotoxicity due to cisplatin can result in treatment delays, dose modifications, and in severe cases, discontinuation of treatment.

The identification of gene mutations in lung cancer has led to the development of molecularly targeted therapy to improve the survival of subsets of patients with metastatic disease. In particular, genetic abnormalities in EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways in subsets of NSCLC may define mechanisms of drug sensitivity and primary or acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). To date, approximately 21 TKIs have been approved for use in treating NSCLC with identified tyrosine kinase (TK) mutations; the TKs targeted by these inhibitors include EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF/MEK, RET, and MET. If patients are found to have specific TK mutations to which inhibitors are known to respond, treatment with such TKIs is currently standard-of-care for this population of advanced NSCLC. Most tumors will respond to initial treatment with TKIs, exhibiting tumor shrinking or delayed progression. Unfortunately, most patients will eventually develop resistance to the inhibitory effects of initial used inhibitors. Therefore, second- or third-line therapy often involves treatment with alternate inhibitors targeting the same kinase but with differing mutations. Such treatment again is often initially successful, but further kinase mutations, or mutations arising in different kinases, often leads to relapse and the need to switch to alternative treatment schemes. This next therapy usually involves chemotherapy (often carboplatin plus pemetrexed), sometimes used in combination with immunotherapy, or enrollment in clinical trials testing new treatment approaches.
 
We believe it is important to pursue the development of novel therapies and combinations thereof that can substantially improve patient survival and quality of life by potentiating the antitumor activity of chemotherapy treatment while protecting against chemotherapy-induced toxicity.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Most never-smoker patients with lung cancer are women, and adenocarcinoma is the most common type. Non-smoker patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) generally have a better response to inhibitors of epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, including without limitation gefitinib and erlotinib, than do those with a history of tobacco smoking. Studies have identified differences in chromosomal aberrations, genetic polymorphisms, gene mutations, and methylation status between lung cancer in non-smokers and tobacco-associated lung cancer. These clinical and biological differences suggest that the two cancers have overlapping but unique pathways of carcinogenesis. The EGFR mutation is one of the most important genetic change in lung cancer in people who have never smoked because it is more common in lung cancer in never-smokers than in tobacco associated lung cancer and is associated with greater therapeutic benefit from inhibitors of EGFR. Other alterations associated with never-smokers include mutations, fusions or amplifications in ALK, ROS1, RET and MET genes. Based upon published articles in CA: Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Nature Review Cancer, incidence in never-smokers is 10% to 15% of all lung cancers and globally, NSCLC in never-smokers comprises 15% to 20% of cases in men and greater than 50% in women. In Asia, never-smokers with NSCLC are 60% to 80% women and 20% to 40% men.
 
We are focused on advancing LP-300 as a potential combination therapy for never smoking NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma by leveraging our A.I. platform to help uncover the genomic and biomarker networks that are associated with response in the never-smoker and non-smoker groups. Additionally, through our early, preclinical work to define a gene signature that correlates with heightened sensitivity to LP-300, we believe there is potential to further expand the indication to include all NSCLC patients that have this identified genetic profile in their cancer. Currently there is no approved therapy specifically for the growing indication of never-smokers with NSCLC, and female never smokers appear to be uniquely responsive to LP-300. If successful, LP-300 could provide improved patient benefit in terms of improved survival, and secondarily through the concurrent prevention and mitigation of common and serious chemotherapy-induced toxicities.

Prior Completed Trials of LP-300
 
Phase I. LP-300 has been evaluated in five Phase I studies (DMS10001, BioNumerik, 09/1997 through 04/2004; DMS10002, BioNumerik, 12/1997 through 08/2001; DMS12209, ASKA Pharmaceutical, 04/2000 through 12/2001; DMS10011, BioNumerik, 02/2006 through 07/2006; and DMS12307, Baxter, 07/2002 through 07/2005) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”), and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy of LP-300 (alone or in combination with cisplatin, cisplatin/paclitaxel, or carboplatin/paclitaxel). An MTD for LP-300 was not reached in any of the Phase I studies at dose levels of up to 41 g/m2.
 
Phase II. In a U.S. multi-center, randomized, open-label trial (n=160 patients) with advanced (Stage IIIB and IV) NSCLC treated with LP-300 or no LP-300 (DMS22210/CALGB 30303, Cancer and Leukemia Group B, 08/2004 through 03/2007), although the overall population did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoint, an analysis of a subgroup of patients with adenocarcinoma revealed that the difference in the median overall survival period between the 2 treatment groups was statistically significant (LP-300 = 15.6 months, no LP-300 = 8.9 months; Log-rank p=0.0326), and the median overall survival for patients who received LP-300 was 6.7 months longer than that of those who did not receive LP-300.
 
Phase III. LP-300 has been evaluated in five Phase III studies: two in patients with metastatic breast cancer, with a primary endpoint examining the ability to reduce platinum/taxane induced peripheral neuropathy, and three in patients with NSCLC or advanced primary lung adenocarcinoma. (DMS32205R, ASKA Pharmaceutical, 08/2005 through 02/2008; DMS30203R, BioNumerik, 09/2001 through 10/2006; DMS30204R, ASKA Pharmaceutical, 04/2003 through 03/2006; DMS32206R, Baxter, 10/2002 through 04/2006; and DMS32212R, BioNumerik, 04/2010 through 06/2013) Although the overall population did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoints in any of the trials, analysis of subgroups of patients in one multi-country lung adenocarcinoma trial and one Japanese NSCLC trial revealed differences in the median overall survival between the two treatment arms (with or without LP-300 treatment). The results from the two key lung cancer trials obtained from retrospective analyses are described below:
 

● | Multi-country, double-blind, randomized, multi-center & placebo-controlled trial (n=540 patients) with advanced primary lung adenocarcinoma treated with LP-300 or Placebo & paclitaxel or docetaxel with cisplatin (DMS32212R). (the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ø | Treatment with LP-300 nearly doubled the Overall Survival in women receiving paclitaxel/cisplatin (25.0-month median OS in LP-300 arm vs. 13.2-month OS in control arm) and the results in this subgroup were statistically significant (P-value = 0.0477; HR = 0.579) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ø | For never smoking women with adenocarcinoma of the lung receiving paclitaxel/cisplatin, the Overall Survival in the LP-300 arm was more than double the control arm (27.0 months vs. 13.4 months, respectively) also being statistically significant in favor of LP-300 (P-value = 0.0167; HR = 0.367) and the 2-year survival was 72.4% in the LP-300 arm vs. 32.3% in the control arm. 


● | Statistically significant subgroup analyses and trends from this LP-300 Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial support repositioning LP-300 for non- or never smokers with adenocarcinoma of the lung. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and multi-center trial in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving paclitaxel & cisplatin (Japan Trial) (DMS32205R). The Japan Trial observations support and complement observations in the multi-country Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial. The observations for the female adenocarcinoma patient population in the LP-300 multi-country Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial are consistent with observations made for the subgroup of females with adenocarcinoma of the lung receiving paclitaxel/cisplatin and LP-300 or placebo in the Japan Trial. Although the overall population in the Japanese trial did not meet the pre-specified primary endpoint, a retrospective analysis of the subgroup consisting of female patients with adenocarcinoma revealed that the difference in the median overall survival period between the two treatment arms in this subgroup was significant (P-value = 0.0456, HR = 0.376).

The LP-300 arm of the multi-country Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial also demonstrated safety profile advantages in terms of the potential to protect against chemotherapy-induced kidney toxicity and chemotherapy-induced anemia. These observations complemented earlier clinical observations regarding LP-300’s potential to protect against neuropathy and other chemotherapy-induced toxicities. Results from these trials indicate that treatment with LP-300 may, in further clinical testing, lead to improved survival in female and non- or never smoking patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the lung receiving cisplatin/paclitaxel combination chemotherapy.
 
Phase II and III LP-300 Adverse Events Summary
 
The following summarizes adverse events reported from a total of 1,712 patients enrolled in five randomized multi-center phase II and phase III studies with chemotherapy, with or without LP-300. A total of 1,712 patients were enrolled in these studies, of which 856 patients received LP-300 with chemotherapy.
 

● | All Adverse Events (AEs). The most frequently-occurring adverse events in patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy were generally similar to patients receiving placebo or chemotherapy alone. These events included blood and lymphatic system disorders (myelosuppression manifested as anemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia; also including decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, red blood cell count, platelet count, and white blood cell count), with an incidence ranging from 12% to 83%; gastrointestinal disorders including constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, stomatitis, and vomiting, with an incidence ranging from 22% to 83%; general disorders and administrative site conditions including fatigue (ranging from 17% to 85%); infusion/injection site pain/reactions (ranging from 12% to 18%); malaise (ranging from 16% to 28%); peripheral edema (ranging from 13% to 22%); pyrexia (ranging from 10% to 17%); infections and infestations disorders including nasopharyngitis (ranging from 11% to 16%); investigations including increased liver function tests including ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase (ranging from approximately 10% to 55%); increased blood lactate dehydrogenase (ranging from approximately 17% to 26%); increased blood urea or blood uric acid (ranging from approximately 11% to 32%); increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (ranging from approximately 23% to 33%); decreased total protein (ranging from approximately 12% to 21%); metabolic and nutritional disorders including weight decreased (ranging from 15% to 22%), anorexia (ranging from 14% to 82%), and hypomagnesemia (ranging from 22% to 30%); musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders including arthralgia, back pain, and myalgia (ranging from 7% to 80%); nervous system disorders including dysgeusia (ranging from 12% to 22%), headache (ranging from 14% to 17%), and peripheral neuropathy (motor and sensory – ranging from 22% to 86%); psychiatric disorders including insomnia (ranging from 12% to 17%); respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders including dyspnea (ranging from 12% to 40%); skin and subcutaneous disorders including alopecia (ranging from 33% to 92%); rash (ranging from 22% to 29%); nail disorder/discoloration (10%); and vascular disorders including angiopathy (ranging from 64% to 69%) and flushing (ranging from 15% to 39%).

● | Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). 11% to 49% of patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy, and 7% to 42% of patients in control groups receiving chemotherapy alone experienced SAEs during randomized multicenter studies. Frequently-occurring SAEs in patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy included pneumonia, hypersensitivity or drug hypersensitivity, dyspnea, pyrexia and dehydration, diarrhea, anaphylactic shock or anaphylactic reactions, vomiting, disease progression, infection, bronchospasm, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, hemolysis, nausea, chills, fatigue, sudden death, neutropenic infection, sepsis, anorexia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, pneumonitis, rash, and hypotension. Multiple allergic reactions have been reported in clinical trials of LP-300, and some of these reactions have been severe. It is possible that patients could experience an allergic reaction that is life-threatening. Five reports of grade 3 or 4 hemolysis events with three fatal outcomes were reported in patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy in a study involving the weekly drug administration schedule. Two events of hemolysis were reported in a study involving drug administration every two weeks. No events of hemolysis were reported in studies using the three weeks schedule of administration, which is the administration schedule used for the multi-country Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial.

● | Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events. Approximately 7% of patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy experienced treatment-related SAEs during randomized multicenter studies. The most frequently-occurring treatment-related SAEs experienced by patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy were hypersensitivity or drug hypersensitivity (five and two patients, respectively) and neutropenia (six patients). Other treatment-related SAEs experienced by patients receiving LP-300 with chemotherapy included hemolysis, bronchospasm, febrile neutropenia, anemia, nausea, and pulmonary edema (three patients, each); chills, diarrhea, pyrexia, neutropenic infection, hyperglycemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary embolism, sudden death, infection, and rash (two patients, each); and angina pectoris, cardiac arrest, tachycardia, sudden hearing loss, abdominal pain, vomiting, adverse drug reaction, anaphylactic shock, C. difficile colitis, pneumonia, sepsis, chemical cystitis, thrombosis in device, dehydration, leukopenia, anorexia, atrial fibrillation, fatigue, weight decrease, muscle disorder, pain in extremity, dizziness, peripheral sensory neuropathy, dyspnea, hypotension, and thrombosis (one patient, each). 

Clinical Evidence of Toxicity Protection by LP-300 
 
The data from randomized multicenter studies of LP-300 and chemotherapy demonstrates objective evidence of several instances where treatment with LP-300 appears to provide potential benefit in terms of preventing and mitigating chemotherapy-induced toxicities, particularly in studies of LP-300 and chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. These data support that LP-300 has the potential to protect against chemotherapy-induced toxicities, including gastrointestinal, renal, electrolyte disturbances, and anemia; and there is data supporting the potential for LP-300 to protect against severe forms of these toxicities. In addition, treatment with LP-300 may protect against severe platinum-induced hearing loss and dehydration.
LP-300 Mechanism of Action
 
LP-300 is a water-soluble disulfide compound that lacks a free thiol or sulfate moiety. We postulate this unique structure of LP-300 may allow it to potentiate antitumor activity of certain types of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and exert chemoprotective effects, through distinct and interrelated mechanisms. In plasma, the lack of a free thiol prevents untoward reactivity and drug-drug interactions, and thereby may allow chemotherapeutic agents to retain their efficacy. Once inside the tumor cell, LP-300 is metabolized and may then potentiate antitumor activity of cytotoxic certain types of chemotherapy. A significant fraction of LP-300 is taken up by the kidneys, where LP-300’s metabolites can interact with chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, and potentially diminish the chemotherapy drug’s ability to cause organ damage. We believe the postulated mechanisms that can enhance tumor directed chemosensitivity include restoration of apoptotic sensitivity thereby countering drug resistance; oxidative stress enhancement; anti-angiogenesis; decreased DNA synthesis and gene expression; and decreased glutathione and precursors (limiting glutathione tumor-mediated drug resistance). When LP-300 accumulates in the kidneys it appears to reduce the toxicity of certain drugs, such as cisplatin, that are excreted through the renal system.

As depicted in the model below, we believe LP-300 and its metabolites can modulate key components of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems, which are believed to be involved as major mechanisms of the potentially enhanced antitumor effects of LP-300 with chemotherapy. The thioredoxin pathway is commonly upregulated in adenocarcinomas, and examination of primary lung tumors from non-smokers have shown significantly increased gene expression of thioredoxin. Overexpression of thioredoxin in cancer cells has been postulated to lead to resistance to apoptosis, increased cellular proliferation, increased gene expression, increased angiogenesis, increased conversion of DNA into RNA, and resistance to oxidative stress induction. We believe the modulation of thioredoxin expression is important for the observed increases in patient survival identified in retrospective analyses of certain subgroups of patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the lung receiving LP-300 in conjunction with cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Different glutaredoxin transcript variants have been found to be elevated in transformed cells, and glutaredoxin isoforms (e.g., variants of glutaredoxin 2) have been found to be elevated in NSCLC cell lines, lending evidence for potential roles of glutaredoxin in tumor progression.
 
We believe LP-300 and its metabolites may potentiate the antitumor activity of chemotherapy by:
 
(1) shifting the redox balance and concentrations of reduced forms of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin to inactive oxidized forms of thioredoxin and glutaredoxin, thereby restoring apoptotic sensitivity, increasing sensitivity to oxidative stress, inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis, RNA to DNA synthesis, and growth signaling, and
 
(2) forming thioredoxin or glutaredoxin adducts, which as inactive forms lead to thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-mediated reduction of downstream targets in the cell that are important for tumor resistance to chemotherapy, angiogenesis and cell growth.

Working Model for LP-300 Mechanism of Action
 

We believe that LP-300 may potentiate antitumor activity of certain types of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and exert chemoprotective effects through several distinct and interrelated mechanisms of action. LP-300 is a cysteine-modifying agent that appears to modulate multiple cellular pathways simultaneously. Experimental data indicate that LP-300 modifies and/or modulates the following key pathways:

● | Kinases involved in key signaling pathways (EGFR, ALK, ROS, MET) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enzymes critical for DNA synthesis and repair (ERCC1, RNR1, RNR2) 
● | Enzymes and proteins important in regulating cell redox status (TRX, PRX, GRX, PDI)

The following key mechanisms have been observed to support our belief that LP-300 has potential to play an important role in the treatment of females and never smokers with NSCLC adenocarcinoma. We believe these mechanisms help to explain the retrospective subgroup observations for females and never smokers receiving LP-300 together with cisplatin and paclitaxel in the Phase III NSCLC adenocarcinoma trial:
 

● | LP-300 targets cysteine residues. Computational and experimental data indicate that LP-300 demonstrates specificity towards cysteines. LP-300-mediated xenobiotic modulation of protein targets on cysteine results in distinct, (multi)target-specific effects correlated to the role of the cysteine residue(s) in the target. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | LP-300 alone inhibits human ALK and stimulates the inhibitory effect of crizotinib on human ALK. Alterations in ALK, along with MET, ROS1 & PDGFRA are thought to underlie nearly 10% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma cancers. Liquid Chromatography (LC), Mass Spectrometry (MS) and X-ray structural data demonstrate that LP-300 covalently modifies human ALK on Cys1156 and Cys1235. Enzyme assay data demonstrates that LP-300 inhibits human ALK’s kinase activity and stimulates the inhibitory effect of crizotinib on human ALK’s kinase activity. 
● | LP-300 inhibits human MET kinase activity and stimulates Staurosporine inhibition of human MET kinase activity. Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition Factor Kinase (MET) kinase mutations and amplification are an important, specific subset of NSCLC adenocarcinoma. Enzyme assays demonstrate that LP-300 inhibits human MET kinase activity and stimulates the inhibitory activity of staurosporine on human MET kinase. 
● | LP-300 inhibits EGFR kinase activity. EGFR mutations are an important, specific subset of NSCLC adenocarcinoma, particularly in non-smoker females. Enzyme assays demonstrate that LP-300 inhibits EGFR kinase activity and potentiates the inhibitory effect of eErlotinib on wild type as well as mutant EGFR kinase activity. 
● | LP-300 modestly inhibits retinal rod outer segment kinase (ROS1) activity. ROS1 chromosomal rearrangements are a recently identified class of mutations in NSCLC. Estimates of frequency of ROS1 rearrangements range from 1% to 2%. Experimental data are as follows: 


Ø | Enzyme activity data demonstrates that LP-300 has an effect on Human ROS1 activity when ROS1 is preincubated with LP-300. We hypothesize that pre-incubation allows slower reacting cysteine residues to be modulated by LP-300. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ø | Based on modeling studies, the cysteines on ROS1 appeared to be in less optimal orientations compared to cysteines in ALK. 
Ø | LP-300 appears not to impact ROS1 activity unless ROS1 and LP-300 are pre-incubated prior to kinase assays. Therefore, to see an effect in vivo, it may be necessary to administer LP-300 prior to LP-300’s effects on ROS1 through preincubation of ROS1 and LP-300, suggesting slower xenobiotic modulation reactions. However, there are several possible explanations for the LP-300 effect on ROS1 and in the absence of an X-ray structure this remains a hypothesis. 


● | LP-300 modifies Ribonucleotide Reductase 1 and 2 (RNR1 and RNR2). Selective, elevated expression of the RNR1 subunit is associated with gemcitabine resistance in NSCLC. RNR1/RNR2 are essential for DNA synthesis, DNA repair & cell proliferation. RNR1/2 catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis, from ribonucleotides. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | LP-300 targets proteins that may result in protection against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity and neuropathy. The LP-300 derivative-cisplatin/paclitaxel conjugate is inactive and this conjugate is not a substrate for aminopeptidase/γ-Glutamyl-transpeptidase (APN/GGT). These LP-300 heteroconjugates appear to cause potent inhibition of APN/GGT leading to suppression/bypass of renal APN/GGT xenobiotic metabolism pathways promoting protection against chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity. In addition, binding of the LP-300 derivative with reactive cisplatin/paclitaxel species, appears to inactivate the platinum-catalyzed microtubule hyper-polymerization. This action may serve to protect against chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. 
● | LP-300 modulates protein function in a way that may promote chemosensitization. LP-300 appears to promote covalent oxidation of redox proteins Thioredoxin (TRX), Peroxiredoxin1 (PRX1) and Glutaredoxin (GRX). This action may keep these redox proteins in an inactive non-signaling state, which could enhance sensitivity to oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by concomitant chemotherapy.

Using various in vitro experimental approaches, LP-300 has been observed to form adducts on cysteines of various protein targets such as those listed below. For several of these targets, studies evaluating enzyme activity associated with the targets have demonstrated inhibition, modulation or impairment of such activity. In addition, X-ray crystallographic studies support LP-300 derived adducts at specific cysteines on these proteins.
 
Targeted Proteins Modified by LP-300
 

Cellular Target of LP-300 | Cellular consequence of LP-300-modification and/or modulation 
----------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cellular thiol/disulfide balance | LP-300 and LP-300-derived mesna disulfide heteroconjugates are pharmacological surrogate/modulators of physiological thiols and disulfides (e.g., glutathione, cysteine, and homocysteine). 
Gamma-Glutamyltranspeptidase Aminopeptidase N | LP-300 and LP-300-derived mesna disulfide heteroconjugates can inhibit gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and aminopeptidase N enzyme activity. 
Tubulin | LP-300 exerts direct and indirect protective interactions with tubulin. 
Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) | LP-300 disrupts/blocks ATP binding site resulting in inhibition of ALK kinase activity (vide infra). 
Mesenchymal Epithelial Transition (MET) Factor Kinase | Modification of non-active site cysteine(s) resulting in enzyme inhibition (MET). 
ROS1 kinase | LP-300 xenobiotically modifies ROS1 kinase in a time dependent manner. 
Redox Balance | LP-300 and LP-300-derived mesna disulfide heteroconjugates assist in the maintenance of cellular redox balance and support cellular defenses against oxidative insult. 
Thioredoxin (Trx) Glutaredoxin (Grx) | LP-300 modifies non-catalytic cysteines important in redox protein function/structure (Grx and Trx). 
Thioredoxin (Trx) Glutaredoxin (Grx) | LP-300 and/or LP-300-derived mesna disulfide heteroconjugates function as alternative substrates/inhibitors (Trx, Grx) resulting in impaired enzyme activity. 
Peroxiredoxin (Prx) | LP-300 disrupts active site structure (Prx) resulting in impaired enzyme activity. 

 
Mechanistic evaluation of LP-300 revealed that it has cysteine-modifying activity on select Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) initiating proliferative signaling such as ALK, EGFR, MET and ROS1. LP-300 may also serve as a potential chemosensitizer for certain combination chemotherapies by inactivating proteins such as Thioredoxin (TRX), Glutaredoxin (GRX) and Peroxiredoxin (PRX) that are important in modulating cellular redox status and in turn drug resistance. Higher levels of PRX gene expression have been shown to correlate significantly with the absence of smoking history and with the female gender.
 
We believe well-tolerated profile advantages of LP-300 are imparted through its chemoprotective action via production of inactive LP-300-chemotherapeutic conjugates and preventing toxic taxane/platinum metabolites in the kidney, and targeting toxicity-inducing molecules and pathways (e.g. APN, GGT, and Tubulin).
 
Our RADR® Platform’s Approach to LP-300 Repositioning
 
Our RADR® platform has been implemented with the objective of uncovering insights from LP-300 rescued preclinical data as well as from lung cancer clinical trial data regarding actionable bioinformatics, biomarkers, target population demographics and smoking history. Differential expression analyses of RNAseq data on LP-300 pre- and post-exposure in selected NSCLC cell lines has revealed gene sets that could be upregulated and downregulated in response to LP-300 treatments involving the mapping of genes performing cellular redox functions, kinases involved in proliferating signaling, and apoptotic markers. We are currently in the early stages of defining a specific biomarker signature that correlates with heightened sensitivity to LP-300. We believe that this signature may help accelerate the clinical development of LP-300 and has the potential to guide patient selection for targeted clinical trials. We are also developing a list of approved cancer drugs that, when used in combination with LP-300, may have potential to improve the overall benefit to patients through either potentially greater anticancer properties or improved tolerability. We believe identifying such combinations would be attractive to established pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

LP-184
 
General Overview
 
LP-184 (hydroxyureamethylacylfulvene) is a small molecule that preferentially damages DNA in cancer cells that overexpress certain biomarkers or that harbor mutations in DNA repair pathways. LP-184 is converted into an active alkylating agent by the enzyme prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), which is overexpressed in many tumor types that are resistant to current standard of care treatments. The FDA has granted LP-184 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma and ATRT (Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors). We believe cancer cells are less likely to develop resistance to LP-184 because of its mode of action that is independent of efflux pumps and oncogene/tumor suppressor mutations. We also believe that LP-184 has the potential to address a significant unmet need in the current treatment landscape for multiple important cancer types.
 
LP-184 has nanomolar potency and it is a member of a new generation of acylfulvenes, a family of naturally-derived anticancer drug candidates. Earlier generations of acylfulvenes showed great promise in preclinical studies, but were hampered in human clinical studies because of the inability to deliver effective therapeutic doses due to unacceptable toxicities to normal cells. In preclinical studies, LP-184 has shown significantly enhanced antitumor activity as compared to earlier generation acylfulvenes. In addition, we have used our RADR® platform, together with work of collaborators, to develop a patient-specific biomarker test we believe will be predictive of LP-184’s anticancer activity in targeted patient populations. The chemical structure of LP-184 is depicted below.
 

LP-184 Chemical Structure
 
Starlight Therapeutics Inc. and STAR-001
 
In January 2023, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Starlight Therapeutics Inc. (“Starlight”), to develop drug candidate LP-184’s central nervous system (CNS) and brain cancer indications – including glioblastoma (GBM), brain metastases (brain mets.), and several rare pediatric CNS cancers. Following the formation of Starlight, we will refer to the molecule LP-184, as it is developed in CNS indications, as “STAR-001”.
Planned Phase I Clinical Trial for LP-184
 
We are advancing LP-184 towards a Phase I clinical trial in patients with late-stage solid tumors, including pancreatic, breast, lung, bladder, prostate, and ovarian cancers. For the dose escalation portion of the study, in addition to the primary objective of determining the MTD (maximum tolerated dose)/MAD (maximum administered dose) and the recommended dose range for LP-184, secondary objectives include correlation with expression of the gene PTGR1 (Prostaglandin Reductase 1) and correlations with mutations in DNA damage repair pathway genes. We expect to include up to 40 patients in the Phase 1A portion of the study from multiple clinical sites. For the Phase 1A (dose escalation safety) portion of the study, all-comer solid tumor patients are expected to be included.

Upon completion of enrollment in Phase IA and analysis of patient safety, PK, and therapeutic data, we, together with the clinical investigators participating in the study, will review the study data package to determine the recommended dose to be used in further clinical testing of LP-184.
 
LP-184 Development Opportunities
 
STAR-001 in Glioblastoma and other CNS Cancers – Starlight Therapeutics Inc.
 
Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of cancer that begins in the brain and accounts for more than half of all brain cancers. Glioblastoma has an overall five-year survival rate of 5%, meaning that only approximately 5 in 100 people survive GBM for five years and beyond. We believe that STAR-001’s molecular features and distinct mechanism of action, anti-tumor efficacy and strong correlation with specific biomarkers have the potential to provide a unique and powerful approach aimed at addressing high unmet needs in GBM and other aggressive CNS tumors.
 
Data and observations supporting the development of STAR-001 for GBM and other brain cancers include the following:
 

● | We have obtained favorable preclinical in vivo and in vitro data supporting the ability of STAR-001 to cross the blood brain barrier. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | STAR-001 treatment induced tumor regression evidenced by greater than 106% tumor growth inhibition in two subcutaneous xenograft models of GBM (U87 and M1123). STAR-001 also prolonged survival in mice bearing an intracranially implanted tumor model of GBM (U87), as compared with those that did not receive any drug substance. 
● | Intravenous administration of STAR-001 over two cycles reduced subcutaneous xenograft tumor volume in mice by greater than 85% within the treatment group. 
● | In an orthotopic GBM xenograft tumor model in mice, a single cycle of STAR-001 resulted in a statistically significant (p < 0.0001) extension of median overall survival in the STAR-001-treated group (42 days) versus the control group (33 days). 
● | Analyses driven by RADR® have identified, in clinical databases, GBMs with elevated PTGR1 expression and harboring defects in DNA damage repair components as a targeted subset of genetically defined patients who could potentially benefit from STAR-001-based therapy. 
● | Preclinical data supports the observation that STAR-001 can be an effective treatment in GBM regardless of MGMT (a DNA repair enzyme) status of the cancer. This has significant potential to provide a much-needed alternative to the standard-of-care drug, temozolomide (TMZ), especially in GBMs that over-express MGMT — which can be up to 50% of GBM cancers. 
● | In August 2021, the FDA granted STAR-001 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of GBM and other malignant gliomas.

The standard treatment for glioblastoma includes radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Based on an article in the journal Genes and Diseases (Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma multiforme, Genes Dis., 2016 May 11;3(3):198-210) and other publications, at least fifty percent of temozolomide treated patients do not respond to this treatment, and others often form resistance to temozolomide based regimens. We have obtained preclinical data supporting the observation that STAR-001 can be an effective treatment in GBM regardless of the MGMT (a DNA repair enzyme) status of the cancer. This has significant potential to provide a much-needed alternative to the standard-of-care drug, temozolomide (TMZ), especially in GBMs that over-express MGMT — which can be up to 50% of GBM cancers. Patients that have GBMs that over-express MGMT are generally unresponsive to TMZ and need new therapy options that can exploit other molecular pathways and mechanisms.
 
We believe STAR-001’s ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, together with its anti-tumor efficacy and sensitivity correlations with relevant biomarkers, highlight STAR-001’s potential for use as both monotherapy as well as a synergistic agent in combination with other drugs to address the unmet needs in GBM and other aggressive central nervous system tumors.
 
STAR-001 in ATRT and Pediatric Rare Disease Designation
 
ATRTs (Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors) are rare neurological tumors that primarily affect children under the age of three. These clinically aggressive tumors are associated with a very poor prognosis, including a median survival of 6-12 months and a 5 year survival rate of 30%. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that in the U.S. there are 600 living ATRT patients with 60 new patients diagnosed annually. These tumors are typically pathogenetically driven by loss of function of the SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 genes. We believe that STAR-001’s molecular features and distinct mechanism of action, observed preclinical anti-tumor efficacy and correlation with specific biomarkers have the potential to provide a unique and powerful approach aimed at addressing unmet needs for this ultrarare pediatric cancer. We plan to pursue further preclinical studies of STAR-001 in this indication.
 
Data and Observations supporting the development of STAR-001 for ATRT include the following:
 

● | We have obtained favorable preclinical in vivo and in vitro data supporting the ability of STAR-001 to cross the blood brain barrier. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | STAR-001 was observed to have a potent efficacy in ATRT cell lines CHLA-02, CHLA-05, and CHLA-06 with IC50s (nM) of 1776, 162, and 37.4, respectively. 
● | In ATRT xenograft tumor models in mice, i.v. injections of STAR-001 at either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg had high in vivo efficacy. At both concentrations xenografts showed complete tumor regression compared to the vehicle control group. 
● | Preclinical in vivo and in vitro data supports the in-silico observation that STAR-001 can be an effective treatment for ATRT. Currently, there is no standard of care for treatment of children with ATRT. 
● | STAR-001 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation to treat ATRT. 

 
The FDA grants rare pediatric disease designation for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect children ages 18 years or younger and fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program is intended to address the challenges that drug companies face when developing treatments for these unique patient populations. Under this program, companies are eligible to receive a priority review voucher following approval of a product with rare pediatric disease designation if the marketing application submitted for the product satisfies certain conditions, including approval prior to September 30, 2026 unless changed by legislation. If issued, a sponsor may redeem a priority review voucher for priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product candidate, or the priority review voucher could be sold or transferred to another sponsor.

LP-184 in Pancreatic Cancer
 
Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Despite rigorous highly cytotoxic therapies and a few approved targeted therapies, typical life expectancy for advanced pancreatic cancer remains below 1 year, leaving a large number of patients with no additional treatment options. LP-184 has demonstrated significant potency in multiple preclinical studies focused on pancreatic cancer, and we are positioning LP-184 for areas of high unmet need in genetically targeted pancreatic cancers.
 
Data and observations supporting the development of LP-184 for pancreatic cancer include the following:
 

● | We believe LP-184 acts by selectively damaging DNA in tumors that express high levels of the enzyme PTGR1 – which occurs in several solid tumors. Analysis with our data platform, RADR®, indicates that 35-40% of pancreatic tumors overexpress PTGR1. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Preclinical studies have shown significant and targeted anti-tumor effects of LP-184, even in pancreatic cancers that are resistant to standard-of-care drugs. 
● | Pancreatic tumors with DNA-damage repair deficiencies were significantly more sensitive (by two times) to LP-184 in preclinical studies. This and other observations support LP-184’s potential as a synthetic lethal agent in many HRD (homologous recombination deficient) and NERD (nucleotide excision repair deficient) cancers. 
● | LP-184, demonstrated significant and rapid pancreatic tumor shrinkage, by over 90%, in in-vivo mouse models in 8 weeks. In comparison, the tumors in the untreated mice grew by over eleven-fold in volume during the same 8 week period. 
● | Additional positive preclinical data on the efficacy and potency of LP-184 was gathered from 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines, and an additional 5 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) ex-vivo tumor models. Significant reduction of cancer cells and cancer cell growth was observed across all pancreatic cancer cell lines and PDX models that were tested in the study with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (45-270 nM). 
● | Our A.I. based identification of the key gene in the drug mechanism-of-action for LP-184 was validated by leveraging gene-editing (CRISPR) technology to validate PTGR1 as a fundamental driver of tumor sensitivity and cancer cell death. 
● | LP-184 treatment of 2 PDX models for HR deficient pancreatic cancer in preclinical studies resulted in 110-140% tumor growth inhibition. 
● | In August 2021, the FDA granted LP-184 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Additional LP-184 Background
 
We have evaluated LP-184 in a number of solid tumors that overexpress certain biomarkers that have been identified as correlating with potential response to LP-184. Our analysis indicates that LP-184 is expected to be a pro-drug activated by the enzyme Prostaglandin Reductase 1 (“PTGR1”). We believe LP-184’s mechanism of action is to alkylate DNA and protein macromolecules, form adducts, and arrest cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle.
 
Using our RADR® platform, we have derived a 10-gene signature composed of candidate biomarkers determining sensitivity to LP-184. Genes from this signature, such as PTGR1, were found to be implicated in the potential induction of bioactivation of LP-184. We believe LP-184 may be well positioned as a new drug candidate for individual patient genetic profiles identified as having DNA repair complex deficiencies or other commonly prevalent gene signatures. LP-184 displayed less bone marrow toxicity in preclinical studies (dog and mouse), had an improved pharmacokinetic profile (increased bioavailability as reflected by increased AUC), was stable in plasma, and had an increased shelf life or stability in pharmaceutical grade material (sterile glass containers) for its class of compounds. LP-184 retained selective cytotoxicity towards solid tumor derived cell lines in vitro.
 
We believe LP-184 is a non-hormone, next generation alkylating agent with nanomolar potency that preferentially damages DNA in cancer cells that overexpress certain biomarkers indicated primarily in solid tumors such as those in prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers. LP-184 was developed using combinatorial chemistry approaches. Based on screening against conventional therapies both in vitro and in vivo, LP-184 cytotoxicity appears to be mediated through the Transcription Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) pathway, via alkylation of DNA leading to cell cycle arrest in S phase. Additional cytotoxic effects on tumors may include the generation of reactive oxygen species, chemical modification of various intracellular proteins, and induction of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (“MAPK”) pathway followed by apoptosis. A proposed model for the mechanism of action of LP-184 is illustrated below.
 
Working Model for LP-148 Mechanism of Action
 


Our RADR® platform has identified multiple solid tumor cancer indications that highly express PTGR1, including prostate, ovarian, kidney, liver, lung, pancreatic and thyroid cancers. Our RADR® platform has and will be employed to correlate results from ongoing preclinical studies with gene expression data with the aim of determining the likely anticancer activity of LP-184 in these cancer indications. With the assistance of insights from RADR®, we have also conducted studies in patient derived xenografts (PDX) models to further elucidate precise targets and potential patient groups for future LP-184 clinical trials.

Use of RADR® in LP-184 Development

Using our RADR® platform, we matched LP-184 drug response data in cell lines and in ex vivo PDX models with gene expression from matched RNA-seq experiments in over 100 samples to build models that predict LP-184 response using a small number of gene expression values. (See Figure A below) The machine learning model was able to accurately predict LP-184 response. (See Figure B below) The final model required only 10 genes - as opposed to the entire transcriptome - to make predictions, with PTGR1 making a dominant contribution. This suggests PTGR1 is required for activity or has a strong effect to enhance drug sensitivity. (See Figure C below)
 
To test this hypothesis, PTGR1 was knocked down with a CRISPR-interference construct that ablated PTGR1 expression, and consequently, LP-184 sensitivity was lost. (See Figure C below) Because the LP-184 model can predict drug response with any RNA data, we surveyed public RNA-seq data to support targeted cancer indications of interest for LP-184. (See Figure D below)
 
We observed that Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT) was predicted to be highly responsive to LP-184, and the presence of its characteristic SWI/SNF-complex mutations in SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 were associated with lower predicted IC50 values. (See Figure E below) We performed mouse xenografts with an ATRT line and validated extreme responsivity to LP-184 that was previously predicted by RADR. This demonstrates RADR® ability to make valid drug response model predictions based on gene expression, which can be used to optimize drug positioning, uncover drug mechanism-of-action, and discover relevant biomarkers.
 


Disease Background for Pancreatic Cancer, Glioblastoma, Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRT), and Prostate Cancer
 
Initial target patient populations for LP-184 include pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) and prostate cancer.
 
Pancreatic Cancer
 
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with a five-year survival rate of 11.5% and a 10-year survival rate of just 1%. This means that only approximately 12 in 100 people will have survived for five years and beyond. Pancreatic cancer has among the lowest 5-year survival rate of any of the 22 common cancers. Global Cancer Statistics 2020 estimates that for pancreatic cancer there are approximately 495,773 new cases of pancreatic cancer globally.
 
The American Cancer Society’s estimates for pancreatic cancer in the United States for 2023 are:
 

● | About 64,050 people (33,130 men and 30,920 women) will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | About 50,550 people (26,620 men and 23,930 women) will die of pancreatic cancer. 

 
Targeting a specific subset of pancreatic cancer patients that are genetically defined has the potential to increase beneficial therapeutic options for patients and may ultimately improve survival for those with this cancer.

Glioblastoma
 
Glioblastoma is a fast-growing, aggressive type of CNS (Central Nervous System) tumor that forms on the supportive tissue of the brain. Glioblastoma is the most common high grade glioma (HGG). The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 24,810 malignant tumors of the brain or spinal cord (14,280 in males and 10,530 in females) will occur in the U.S. in 2023. It also estimates that in 2023, approximately 18,990 deaths will occur from brain and other nervous system cancers. Approximately 250,000 new glioblastoma cases are estimated to occur each year worldwide, with approximately 11,000 to 13,000 new glioblastoma cases estimated to occur each year in the U.S. Glioblastomas usually affect adults. Treating glioblastoma is very difficult due to the brain-blood barrier and treatment often focuses primarily on relieving symptoms.
ATRT
 
Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRT) are rare, rapidly progressing, and malignant pediatric tumors of the central nervous system and are primarily found in children under the age of three. The National Cancer Institute estimates there are 60 cases of ATRT diagnosed per year and 600 patients currently living with ATRTs, of which only 25% are in adults 15 years or older. Patients with ATRTs have a very poor prognosis including a median survival of 6-12 months and a 5 year survival rate of approximately 32%. ATRTs are difficult to treat due to the very rapid onset of these tumors as well as a requirement for therapies that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. The U.S. is expected to capture the majority share of the ATRT market with ~65%.
Prostate Cancer
 
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the US and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the US. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for prostate cancer in the United States for 2023 are:

● | Approximately 288,300 new cases of prostate cancer 
--+-------------------------------------------------------
● | Approximately 34,700 deaths from prostate cancer 

 
Approximately 50% of patients who die from prostate cancer have metastases at diagnosis. The survival gains over the last decade have been modest with acceleration in life-extending drug development occurring in the last three years. Hormonal therapy works to reduce testosterone levels in the body to a level equal to that seen if physical castration were to occur. However, hormonal therapy can become refractory after one to three years and tumor growth may resume. This is referred to as Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (“CRPC”). About 10 - 20 % of prostate cancer patients develop CRPC within five years. Typically, standard hormonal therapy involving Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) was prescribed in the past for all comer patients. Current prescribed regimens involve intensified therapy for most patients (docetaxel for high volume disease, and Zytiga for low and high volume disease) whereas upcoming molecularly selected agents in addition to hormonal therapy are used in an individualized approach to metastasis-directed or local therapy. Standard of care agents for prostate cancer include without limitation (i) Androgen production suppressors, such as Leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Trelstar), Histrelin (Vantas), Abiraterone (Zytiga), (ii) Androgen signaling blockers, such as Flutamide (Eulexin), Bicalutamide (Casodex), Nilutamide (Nilandron), and Enzalutamide (Xtandi), and (iii) chemotherapeutics such as docetaxel and cabazitaxel. In 2022 Pluvicto (active ingredient lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan) was approved by FDA for the treatment of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive mCRPC. Drug classes of new small molecules in development include PARP inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors and DNA Damage Repair (DDR) inhibitors. The PARP inhibitors olaparib (Lynparza) and rucaparib (Rubraca) and the PD1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda) have been approved by the FDA for a subset of the patient population. The identification and characterization of new molecular targets, agents exploiting new or non-parallel mechanisms of action, and the discovery of predictive biomarkers for mCRPC, are three of the major unmet needs in the prostate cancer space in the era of precision medicine that we believe LP-184 may address.

Strategic Academic Collaborations for LP-184
 
We are or have been involved in the following academic collaborations for LP-184:
 

● | The Research Institute of Fox Chase Cancer Center (“FCCC”). Our ongoing collaboration with FCCC has yielded results that strongly link LP-184 efficacy to the expression of PTGR1. PTGR1 was identified by our RADR analysis as the lead gene candidate, the expression of which is essential to LP-184 mediated cytotoxicity. Using CRISPR engineered cells, we have now demonstrated a total lack of activity in tumor cell lines where PTGR1 expression is artificially knocked out. These data continue to support our RADR based predictions and the strategies of using LP-184 for tumor indications based upon PTGR1 expression. Our RADR analysis has identified a multitude of tumors with a higher than required threshold of PTGR1 expression. We have further validated the activity of LP-184 in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. We have also conducted studies to evaluate the efficacy of LP-184 in pancreatic cancer PDX models and in xenografts. Additional wet lab studies are ongoing to further validate RADR defined combinations with standard of care drugs in order to identify optimal synergistic drugs that could be eventually used in potential treatments with LP-184.

● | Kennedy Krieger Institute and the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. We have an ongoing collaboration with Kennedy Krieger Institute and investigators at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We sought this collaboration following multiple unique findings regarding LP-184, including: the preclinical efficacy of LP-184 in glioblastoma (GBM); a positive result suggesting the ability of LP-184 to penetrate the Blood Brain Barrier, in amounts similar to the GBM standard of care agent Temozolomide (TMZ); and LP-184’s special ability to kill GBM cells irrespective of the methylation status of MGMT promoter. We believe there is an urgent unmet need for an effective therapy to treat GBM with unmethylated MGMT. Both wet lab data and RADR based gene correlations highlighted sensitivity of tumor cells that carry unmethylated MGMT to LP-184. We have obtained additional data in an expanded panel of GBM tumor cell lines, neurospheres obtained from patient biopsies and evaluation of LP-184 in GBM xenografts. Results from this collaboration continue to support the promise of LP-184 for GBM.

● | Georgetown University. In the first phase of our collaboration with Georgetown University, we confirmed the efficacy of LP-184 in a panel of prostate cancer organoid models. In the second phase, we are focusing on wet lab validation of the leads generated by our A.I. models of the gene dependency of most sensitive prostate cancers. This project is intended to provide necessary experimental data for use of LP-184 in a personalized medicine approach to treating prostate cancer. Our gene correlation data has highlighted the deficiency of several pathways that hypothetically would allow LP-184 to be synthetically lethal in tumors with such disruptions. Our RADR analysis also indicates that as many as 20% of prostate cancers carry markers that will make these tumors highly sensitive to LP1-84. In Phase 2 or our collaboration with Georgetown, we have focused on the development of gene specific isogenic engineered prostate cancer cell lines to dissect the pathways as well as extend the 2D and 3D prostate cancer studies to in vivo genomically defined prostate cancer PDXs. In addition, we have designed studies that will test LP-184 in combination with several other drugs that are known to inhibit pathways needed to repair damage to DNA caused by LP-184. The advantage of combining our DNA damaging agent along with a DNA damage repair inhibitor is that it is expected to substantially extend the tumor specific efficacy of LP-184, including prostate cancers that might otherwise not carry deficiencies in the DNA repair pathway. We expect that the drug sensitivity data and genomic data from these studies will further guide optimal positioning of LP-184. 
● | The Danish Cancer Society-Research Center. In January of 2022 we entered a new research collaboration with the Danish Cancer Society Research Center (DCRC). The collaboration is directed to examining the most common solid tumors in order to determine the patient populations most likely to benefit from our drug candidates LP-100 (irofulven) and LP-184. LP-100 and LP-184 have both been shown to have a synthetically lethal impact in tumors that are lacking nucleotide excision repair (NER) capabilities. An additional aim of this collaboration is to develop improved diagnostic tools to detect NER deficient patient profiles more accurately. Initially, the collaboration is focusing focus on the role of NER deficiency in breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, kidney, bladder, stomach, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers. We expect the data, genomic signatures, and biological models generated from the collaboration to add millions of data points to RADR®. 
● | The Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute (GCCRI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center-San Antonio. In February 2022, we announced a research collaboration with the Greehey Children’s Cancer Research Institute (GCCRI) at the University of Texas Health Science Center-San Antonio. The GCCRI research collaboration is focusing on the effectiveness of LP-184 and LP-284 in genomically-defined pediatric cancers, including several without any effective therapeutic approach. The collaboration is leveraging GCCRI’s pediatric tumor research models and knowledge base to advance LP-184 for the potential treatment of rare pediatric cancers including rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, MRT (malignant rhabdoid tumor), Wilms tumor, and ATRT (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor). Dr. Peter Houghton Ph.D. is leading the collaboration for the GCCRI and is widely regarded as leading expert on pediatric cancer research and in the development of novel approaches to treating childhood cancers. An integral component of Dr. Houghton’s research success has been the development and use of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX), which are clinically relevant cancer models that allow researchers to test novel therapeutics - such as LP-184 - in-vivo, and to directly study how tumors respond to treatment. 
● | Clinical Trials and Research Innovation Center in Northern Ireland. In 2019, we initiated a collaboration with the Clinical Trials and Research Innovation Center in Northern Ireland (“C-TRIC”) on a novel preclinical ex-vivo study focused on determining gene signatures correlated with LP-184 anticancer activity in human fresh prostate tumor tissue biopsies. This study was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impracticality of international travel and the reprioritization of projects due to the pandemic. We are collaborating with other studies in the U.S. and over the next several months will be evaluating the recommencement of the study with C-TRIC.

Pre-IND Enabling Animal Studies 
 
We have conducted IND enabling studies in rats and Beagle dogs to provide supporting information regarding safety profile and selection of the starting dose in humans in connection with the planned IND application for LP-184. These studies included (i) non-GLP dose range finding in rats, (ii) GLP analysis of toxicity in rats, (iii) non-GLP dose range finding in dogs, (iv) GLP analysis of toxicity in dogs, (v) analytical method development for the determination of LP-184 levels in rat and dog plasma, (vi) analytical method validation, and (vii) pharmacokinetic profiling of LP-184 in the plasma of dosed rats and dogs.
 
LP-284
 
LP-284 Chemical Structure
 

General Overview
 
LP-284 is a novel small molecule and DNA damaging agent being developed by Lantern for the treatment of several non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and double hit lymphoma (DHL). LP-284 belongs to the new generation of acylfulvenes, a family of naturally derived anti-cancer drug candidates and is the stereoisomer (enantiomer) of our drug candidate LP-184. In comparison to our other acylfulvenes, LP-100 and LP-184, LP-284 has distinct anti-tumor activities in a variety of hematological cancers including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. LP-284 has the potential to be developed as a monotherapy or combination therapy with other drugs to treat a broad array of hematological cancers. The FDA recently granted LP-284 Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, based on LP-284’s demonstrated anti-tumor activity across a comprehensive number of in vitro and in vivo models of MCL.

In preclinical studies, LP-284 has shown nanomolar potency in several hematological cell lines. Of the hematological cell lines tested, LP-284 had the highest potency against all 6 of the mantle cell lymphoma cell lines tested. LP-284 is also being explored for use as a combination therapy with spironolactone. In the multiple myeloma cell line RPMI8226, combination of 10 mM spironolactone with LP-284 significantly reduced LP-284’s IC50 by 2.4 fold. The absence of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) function in these lymphomas and the need for new agents in the setting of relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphomas support the development of LP-284 in this indication.
 
Additional data from in vitro and in vivo studies supports LP-284’s development for MCL, an aggressive form of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) with immediate patient needs. LP-284 treatment was demonstrated to have significantly greater tumor growth inhibition (TGI) in mice implanted with MCL cell derived xenograft (CDX) tumors, when compared to treatment with the standard-of-care (SOC) agents Ibrutinib or Bortezomib. The figure below describes results from LP-284 in-vitro and in-vivo preclinical studies for MCL and other B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.

Planned Phase I Clinical Trial for LP-284
 
We are advancing LP-284 towards a Phase I clinical trial in patients with relapsed refractory lymphomas. In addition to determination of the recommended dose range for future Phase 1B and Phase 2 studies, we will also evaluate clinical activity correlations with mutations in DNA damage repair pathway genes. We expect to include up to 30 patients in the dose escalation portion of the LP-284 Phase I trial, with the involvement of multiple clinical sites.
Disease Background for Mantle Cell Lymphoma
 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, heterogenous and aggressive subtype of B-cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). MCL is a blood cancer of the lymph nodes and tumor cells originating from the “mantle zone” of the lymph node and is characterized by constitutively dysregulated cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression. MCL is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is largely considered incurable.
 
Nearly all MCL patients relapse from the MCL standard-of-care agents Bortezomib and Ibrutinib and there is an urgent and unmet need for novel improved therapeutic options for these patients. According to Leukemia and Lymphoma society about 4,200 new cases of MCL are diagnosed in the United States annually, representing approximately 6% of all NHL patients.
 
LP-100
 
General Overview
 
LP-100 or 6-Hydroxymethylacylfulvene (or irofulven) exploits cancer cells’ deficiency in DNA repair mechanisms. We believe LP-100 has the potential to be an important compound — either as monotherapy or in combination — for several challenging cancers that are impacting patients globally.
 
We recently announced data for LP-100 supporting the development of LP-100 in combination with the class of anticancer agents known as PARP inhibitors (PARPi). In prostate cancer mouse xenograft studies, LP-100 demonstrated synergistic potency when used in combination with the FDA-approved PARP inhibitor Olaparib. LP-100 also demonstrated synergy with the FDA-approved PARP inhibitors Olaparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib in ovarian cancer cell line studies. The observations from these studies are further supported by in-silico evaluation of LP-100 in combination with PARP inhibitors using Lantern’s RADR® platform. We believe this development focus will enhance the potential to position LP-100 in earlier lines of therapy, while also opening the door to pursue treatment indications with larger market sizes.
 
LP-100 has previously been in a genomic signature guided phase 2 clinical trial in Denmark for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 9 patients (out of a targeted enrollment of 27) were treated in the trial. The median overall survival (OS) for the initial group of 9 patients was approximately 12.5 months, which is an improvement over other similar fourth-line treatment regimens for mCRPC. Based on our evaluation of the synergies of LP-100 with PARP inhibitors, the decision has been made to close the phase 2 clinical trial in Denmark, to allow the focus of LP-100-directed resources on positioning the molecule for development in earlier lines of therapy with potentially larger market opportunities. Earlier line treatment indications where we believe LP-100 in combination with PARPi could have potential future treatment benefits include prostate cancer indications such as HRR gene-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, ovarian cancer indications such as first line platinum-responsive advanced ovarian cancer, and breast cancer indications such as germline BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer.
 
LP-100 and PARP inhibitors act by complementary mechanisms. LP-100 acts by a synthetically lethal mechanism of action that preferentially damages DNA in cancer cells lacking nucleotide excision repair (NER) capabilities. PARP inhibitors have been shown to be effective in the treatment of tumors with deficiencies in homologous recombination repair (HR). We believe the simultaneous exploitation of both these mechanisms will enhance the development opportunities for LP-100, while also expanding potential market opportunities for existing PARP inhibitors.
 
In July 2021, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to reacquire global development and commercialization rights for LP-100 from Allarity Therapeutics A/S, which previously managed the current Phase 2 trial for LP-100. As a result of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we obtained full authority to manage and guide future clinical development and commercialization of LP-100.
 
In conjunction with our evaluation work on LP-100 with PARP inhibitors, we have been collaborating with the Danish Cancer Society Research Center (DCSRC) to explore the future clinical potential of LP-100 across 9 different solid tumor types that have known deficiencies in DNA repair pathway mechanisms. This work has included examination of the role of NER deficiency in breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, kidney, bladder, stomach, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers, with the aim of identifying the most promising patient populations for future LP-100 therapy.
 
History of LP-100
 
LP-100 shows multiple cytotoxic effects on tumor cell biology such as DNA adduct formation, RNA polymerase stalling and redox protein modification. It demonstrates enhanced sensitivity in DNA repair deficient (e.g. ERCC3 mutant or knockout) in vitro and in vivo models. In historical testing, clinical antitumor activity for LP-100 was observed in approximately 10-12% of patients with multidrug resistant advanced prostate cancer with notable resolution of bone metastases.

LP-100 belongs to the family of compounds and small molecular entities (molecular weight <330) that represent a class of anticancer agents derived from fungal toxins called Illudins. Acylfulvenes were originally synthesized and developed by Drs. Michael J. Kelner and Trevor C. McMorris at University of California at San Diego (“UCSD”). In 1987, Professor McMorris published the first preclinical evaluation of the Illudins as anticancer agents and a library of hundreds of acylfulvene derivatives was created, many with significant in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity and potentially improved selectivity for tumor cells versus normal cells. The compound Illudin S was found to be highly cytotoxic against cancer cells, but demonstrated a poor therapeutic index. Better understanding of the mechanism of action led to the development of a novel family of semisynthetic antitumor agents, or next-generation acylfulvenes such as 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene, now designated as LP-100. LP-100 is a semisynthetic derivative of Illudin S, one of a series of sesquiterpene natural products (Illudins) isolated from the Lantern mushroom Omphalotus illudens. LP-100 was selected for further study based on its potential to demonstrate promising antitumor activity while maintaining a more favorable therapeutic index, compared to previously studied Illudins. The chemical structure of LP-100 is depicted below.
 
LP-100 Chemical Structure
 

Mechanism of Action
 
LP-100 leads to rapid inhibition of DNA synthesis and induction of DNA damage. LP-100 is a monofunctional covalent DNA binder that inhibits DNA synthesis and replication, affects cell cycle and induces apoptosis. DNA repair of LP-100-induced lesions is mediated by components of the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway. LP-100 produces damage to DNA that can only be repaired by the TC-NER pathway. The DNA damage is unique, as two enzymes, RNA Polymerase III and Topoisomerase I (Topo 1), associated with the TC-NER are displaced leading to irreversible inactivation of the repair pathway. Other conventional DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin and others, produce general damage that can be repaired by the Global Genome Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER) pathway. Tumor cells often develop multidrug resistance (MDR) making them impossible to kill using conventional drugs. LP-100 appears to retain activity against MDR tumor cells regardless of the mechanism of resistance and tumor cells appear less likely to become resistant to LP-100. Killing of MDR tumor cells by LP-100 reflects its unique mechanism of disrupting the TC-NER pathway. Cell-based studies have demonstrated selective cytotoxicity of LP-100 towards a variety of solid tumor cell lines. The tumor cells cannot recover from this damage, undergo S-phase arrest, and then irreversibly initiate both caspase-dependent and –independent apoptosis pathways. LP-100 produces DNA damage and induces apoptotic DNA fragmentation in several tumor cell lines. Normal diploid cells, in contrast, do not normally need repair by the TC-NER pathway unless exposed to UV light. Treatment of mouse xenografts of human tumors with LP-100 results in tumor shrinkage. Synergistic or additive activity is observed when LP-100 is combined with various traditional anticancer agents.

LP-100 Clinical Profile
 
Clinical studies of LP-100 have been conducted in multiple solid tumor indications including prostate, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic, thyroid, lung, breast and gastric cancers. More than 38 Phase I or Phase II trials involving > 1,300 patients have been conducted with LP-100. In prior clinical trials, LP-100 showed activity and produced regression in a variety of cancers, but failed to meet required endpoints for clinical trial success. Objective responses were reported for LP-100 single agent therapy in drug-resistant prostate (hormone and taxotere refractory), ovarian (platinum resistant), pancreatic, sarcoma, kidney, endometrial, and lung cancers. LP-100 also showed cancer treating potential when administered in combination with a variety of conventional chemotherapeutics including Camptosar, GemZar, Taxotere, Xeloda, Cisplatin, and Oxaliplatin. In a study of patients who failed prior conventional therapies, two rounds of LP-100 therapy led to rapid resolution of ovarian cancer metastasis. In a randomized Phase IIb study of patients with metastatic hormone refractory taxotere-resistant prostate cancer, LP-100 was compared to mitoxantrone. A total of 138 patients were enrolled and specified endpoints included overall survival, response rate, and safety assessment. The median one-year survival increased from 22% in the mitoxantrone-treated control group to 41% in the LP-100-treated group. Median overall survival was 10.1 months for treatment arm (LP-100 + Prednisone) and 7.4 months for control arm (Mitoxantrone + Prednisone), i.e. a 37% increase over standard of care. Treatment was well-tolerated in all arms. The most frequent Grade 3–4 toxicities (as % of patients in treatment/control arms) were asthenia (8%/0%), and vomiting (4%/0%). Grade 3–4 hematological events included neutropenia (22%/61%) and thrombocytopenia (23%/4%).In 2001, LP-100 received FDA’s fast track status and a Phase III international clinical trial for LP-100 in refractory pancreatic patients was started. Clinical trials looked promising in shrinking tumors of drug-resistant pancreatic cancer. However, MGI Pharma stopped the Phase III clinical trial because it was unlikely for the trial to reach its objective due to a greater than expected survival benefit associated with the comparator agent (5-FU). In 2005, Phase II clinical trial results of LP-100 in women with recurrent and heavily pre-treated ovarian cancer revealed retinal toxicity. This retinal damage was associated with dose and administration of drug.
 
AF Chemicals
 
In January 2015, the Company entered into a Technology License Agreement to exclusively license domestic and international patent rights from AF Chemicals, LLC (“AF Chemicals”) for the treatment of cancer in humans for the compounds LP-100 (Irofulven) and LP-184. In February 2016, the Company and AF Chemicals entered into an Addendum (the “Addendum”) providing for additions and amendments to the Technology License Agreement. In December 2020, the Company and AF Chemicals entered into a Second Addendum (the “Second Addendum”) providing for further additions and amendments to the Technology License Agreement. The Technology License Agreement, Addendum and Second Addendum are collectively referred to as the “AFC License Agreement”.
 
Pursuant to the Second Addendum, the Company made specified payments to AF Chemicals during the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Second Addendum also provides that, from December 30, 2020 until January 15, 2025, the Company will have no obligation to pay annual licensing fees, development diligence extension payments, or patent maintenance fee payments to AFC under the AFC License Agreement.
 
As part of the Second Addendum, the Company has agreed to apply for specified orphan drug designations for LP-184 in the US and EU. The Second Addendum also amends and clarifies other provisions of the Technology License Agreement, and provides the Company with the ability to recover a portion of initial payments made under the Second Addendum from sublicense fees or royalty payments that may be made to AFC by the Company or third parties prior to January 15, 2025.

In addition, the Company is obligated to make milestone payments to AF Chemicals at the time of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) filing relating to LP-184 and other analogs, such as LP-284, and also upon reaching additional specified milestones in connection with the development and potential marketing approval of LP-184 and LP-284 in the United States, specified countries in Europe, and other countries.
 
The AFC License Agreement also provides that the Company will pay AF Chemicals a royalty of at least a very small single digit percentage of specified net sales of LP-184 and other analogs, such as LP-284. In addition, the AFC License Agreement contains specified time requirements for the Company to file an IND, enroll patients in clinical trials, and file a potential NDA with respect to LP-184 or other analogs, with the ability for the Company to pay AF Chemicals additional amounts ranging up to an amount in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars for each one, two, three and four year extension to such development time requirements, with additional extensions beyond four years to be negotiated by the Company and AF Chemicals.
 
Pursuant to the Second Addendum, no additional payments of annual licensing fees or development diligence extension payments are required to be made by the Company until January 15, 2025, at which time these obligations will resume. The Company will also be obligated to make annual licensing fee payments to AF Chemicals relating to LP-100 beginning January 15, 2025, as described below under Allarity Therapeutics.
 
In the event of a sublicense of the rights to LP-184, LP-284 or other analogs, the Company is obligated to pay AF Chemicals (a) a low double digit percentage of the gross income and fees received by the Company with respect to the United States in connection with such sublicense, and (b) a lower double digit percentage of the gross income and fees received by the Company with respect to Europe and Japan in connection with such sublicense.
 
The amounts to be paid to AF Chemicals with respect to LP-100 under the AFC License Agreement are in many ways similar to the amounts to be paid with respect to LP-184 as described above. In addition, the AFC License Agreement contains specified time requirements for the Company to enroll patients in clinical trials, and file a potential NDA with respect to LP-100. Extension fees may be paid by the Company to AF Chemicals from time to time related to these requirements. Pursuant to the Second Addendum with AF Chemicals, no additional payments of annual licensing fees or development diligence extension payments are required to be made by the Company with respect to LP-100 until January 15, 2025, at which time these obligations will resume.
 
Allarity Therapeutics 
 
In May 2015, the Company licensed various rights to LP-100 to Oncology Venture (now known as Allarity Therapeutics) pursuant to a Drug License and Development Agreement. In February 2016, the Company and Allarity Therapeutics entered into an addendum and an amendment providing for additions and amendments to the Drug License and Development Agreement. In connection with the Drug License and Development Agreement, as amended (collectively, the “Allarity License and Development Agreement”), Allarity Therapeutics agreed to directly pay to AF Chemicals on behalf of the Company certain amounts to satisfy the Company’s milestone obligations to AF Chemicals with respect to LP-100 under the AFC License Agreement. Amounts paid by Allarity Therapeutics to AF Chemicals on behalf of the Company would then be deducted from amounts owed by Allarity Therapeutics to the Company.
 
On July 23, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to reacquire global development and commercialization rights for Irofulven (LP-100) from Allarity. The transaction included global rights to LP-100, as well as the developed clinical protocol for an intended study in bladder and prostate cancer patients who have a mutation in the ERCC2/3 genes. As a result of this transaction, the Company obtained full authority to manage and guide future clinical development and commercialization of LP-100. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company paid an initial upfront payment of $1,000,000 to Allarity. The Company determined there was no planned alternative future use for these assets outside of the clinical development of LP-100 and therefore the full amount of the upfront payment was included in research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company released approximately $459,000 from escrow to Allarity related to recertification of LP-100 drug stock during the year ended December 31, 2022. Future payments of up to $500,000 currently held in escrow also have the potential to deliver an additional amount to Allarity based on drug trial enrollment milestones within the 24 months following the date of the transaction. Allarity is also eligible to receive additional milestone payments over the life of the program based on IP license milestones and regulatory filings and approvals in the US and EU, and low- to mid-single-digit royalties on future commercial net sales. As part of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Allarity License and Development Agreement was terminated.

Additional Portfolio Opportunities
 
ADC Program
 
We initiated an ADC program in early 2021, based on the recognition of antibody drug conjugates as a promising therapeutic approach for cancer treatment, and one that has growing interest due to the potential to increase targeted cancer cell death.
 
We are currently evaluating various cytotoxic agents and classes of agents to be used as potential ADC payloads. We have also selected and ranked multiple targeting antibodies of interest with potential to be linked to selected cytotoxic payloads. Our upcoming activities in coming months will be targeted at further evaluation, manufacturing and preclinical testing of potential ADC candidates to select for advancement to Phase I testing.
 
ADCs can provide the ability to take advantage of the high potency of cytotoxic payloads and the superior specificity of antibodies. The drug antibody conjugate thus provides the potential to maximize efficacy and minimize systemic toxicity. Recent years have seen multiple FDA approvals in the growing class of ADCs for therapeutic use. This has driven increased deal-making and portfolio additions by large pharma companies. Two of the four largest oncology licensing transactions in 2020 were for ADC assets. In addition to the acquisition of Immunomedics by Gilead, Merck acquired Velos Bio in November of 2020 and NBE Therapeutics was acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim in December of 2020. It is notable that both NBE and Velos, at the time of their acquisition, had just successfully completed Phase 1 trials using their ADC approach in specific cancer subtypes.
 
In December 2020, we entered into an Evaluation and Limited Use Agreement (the “Evaluation Agreement”) with Califia Pharma, Inc. aimed at collaborating on the in vitro and in vivo testing and evaluation of novel Califia linker technology and related payloads to be conjugated to a Lantern targeting entity. The Evaluation Agreement expired on December 31, 2021 and we determined not to extend it.
 
Additional Research and Development Collaborations for Our Drug Candidates
 
Virtually all of our developmental work is expected to be performed in contract labs in the near future, and most of it requires close collaboration with these groups. Our strategic collaborations have specialized focus areas tailored to advancing our pipeline drug candidates and provide expertise benefits.

Collaborator | Focus Area | Drug Candidate

Manufacturing Overview
 
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities or have any manufacturing employees. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) for the manufacturing of our drug candidates for preclinical uses, clinical trials as well as for commercial manufacturing if our drug candidates receive marketing approval. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our drug candidates. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a project by project basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. For all of our drug candidates, we intend to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services prior to seeking regulatory approval.
 
LP-184 and LP-284 Manufacturing
 
We have contracted with Southwest Research Institute® (“SwRI®”) for the development of a fully synthetic route to LP-184 and LP-284, as well as for the cGMP synthesis of LP-184 API material. We have contracted with Shilpa Medicare Limited and affiliates (“Shilpa”) for the synthesis of a key starting material relating to the synthesis of LP-184 under cGMP as well as for drug product development and cGMP drug product manufacturing of LP-184. In addition, we have contracted with Shilpa for the cGMP synthesis of LP-284 API material as well as for drug product development and cGMP drug product manufacturing of LP-284.
 
LP-300 Manufacturing
 
We have contracted with Patheon API Services, Inc. (“Patheon”) and Curia Global, Inc. (“Curia”) for the manufacture and supply of LP-300 cGMP API material. We have contracted with Berkshire Sterile Manufacturing (“Berkshire”) and Piramal Pharma Solutions (“Piramal”) for the provision of services relating to cGMP drug product manufacturing of LP-300.
Commercialization
 
We retain worldwide commercialization rights for our product candidates LP-300, LP-184, LP-284, and LP-100. We plan to continue considering out-license and collaboration opportunities in order to maximize returns and pursue successful development of our key candidates. We currently have no sales, marketing or product distribution capabilities. However, once we have key candidates closer to FDA approval, we may build our own specialty sales force, partner with a larger pharmaceutical organization, or out-license our drug candidates.
 
We are continually evaluating out-license opportunities for our candidates at later stages of development in order to focus on identifying and licensing additional drug candidates for novel indications and/or patient subpopulations with an oncology focus for expansion of our pipeline.
 
Our commercial plans and strategy for each particular program may change as our programs advance, the markets change, we receive more clinical data, and depending on availability of capital.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have an extensive multi-national portfolio of intellectual property rights directed to our drug candidates, and their targeted use and development in specific patient populations and in specific therapeutic indications.

As of March 1, 2023, we own or control rights in over 80 active patents and patent applications across over 14 patent families whose claims are directed to our drug candidates and what we plan to do with our drug candidates. We have in-licensed or acquired patents and patent applications from AF Chemicals, and BioNumerik directed to the compounds, LP-100, LP-184, LP-284 and LP-300, and methods of using the compounds. Additionally, we have also filed patent applications to further enhance and extend the use of these in-licensed compounds. Our patents are directed to our drug candidates, their usage, manufacturing, and other matters. These matters are essential to precision oncology and relate to: (a) data-driven, biologically relevant biomarker signatures, (b) patient selection and stratification approaches that rely on prediction of response deriving from these signatures and, (c) the ability to develop novel, combination therapy approaches with existing approved therapeutics. We intend to pursue additional patent coverage relating to the use of LP-300 as a potential linker or linking technology.
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, license agreements, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. Additionally, we also rely on the patent applications, trade secrets, and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect the development of our genomic and biomarker signatures that help us in making predictions about the sensitivity to our drug candidates, our patient stratification approaches, and the development of potential combination therapies with our drug candidates.
 
Intellectual Property Portfolio by the Numbers
 
As of March 1, 2023, our intellectual property portfolio consisted of over 14 patent families covered by:
 

● | Over 45 issued patents across our portfolio of compounds in key, commercially important geographies; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Over 38 pending patent applications, including six Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications;

Our policy is to protect the proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and other key jurisdictions important to our business. We fully expect that additional advances will come out of our ongoing work in developing biomarker signatures and patient stratification approaches and that these advances will form the basis of additional intellectual property protection through new patent filings, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights. We will continue to file patent applications and use trade secret laws to protect the uses of our genomic and biomarker signatures, response prediction and patient stratification discoveries. We plan to rely on these intellectual property advances to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position for novel therapeutics and novel formulations and uses of existing and new compounds across multiple therapeutic areas. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available.
 
Patent Portfolio
 
We have an extensive multi-national portfolio of intellectual property rights directed to our drug candidates, and their targeted use and development in specific patient populations and in specific therapeutic indications.

We typically file a non-provisional patent application or a PCT within 12 months of filing the corresponding provisional patent application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any of our existing or future patent applications for our existing or future drug candidates will result in the issuance of patents that effectively protect these candidates, or if any of our issued patents or if any of our licensor’s issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Patent protection for the composition of matter of the LP-300 compound itself is unavailable because the compound was first identified many years ago. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
RADR® Platform
 
We do not own or in-license any patents on our RADR® platform, but we have filed at least four patent applications directed to our RADR® platform and rely on trade secrets and confidential procedures directed to protecting:
 

● | our A.I. and machine learning and training methodologies for our specific purposes in oncology drug development and drug rescue, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our curation and normalization of select data from both public and proprietary data sources, and 
● | our developing insights that can be modeled to cover biological processes as algorithms inside our RADR® platform. 

 
LP-100
 
Our portfolio directed to LP-100 consists of at least four families of in-licensed patents that were filed in 2006. The patents include European, Japanese and US patents. US Patent No. 7655695 relates to acylfulvene analogs that are directed to tumor solid tumor growth inhibition. The nominal expiration for our patents directed to LP-100 is August 2026 and does not account for any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions. We have also filed multiple patent applications directed to LP-100 that, if granted, would expire as late as May 2040.

Our portfolio directed to LP-284 consists of three patent and patent application families and includes two provisional patent applications. US Patent No. 7655695 relates to acylfulvene analogs that are directed to solid tumor growth inhibition. The PCT application filed in 2019 is related to the molecule itself and synthetic preparation methods of the same and has been nationalized in the US, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, EU, India, China, Japan and Australia. A patent application filed in 2021 is directed to using LP-284 to treat leukemia and blood cancers as either a mono or combination therapy.
 
LP-300
 
Our portfolio directed to LP-300 consists of at least four families of owned patents. A more recent PCT patent application filed in 2020 is directed to treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in nonsmokers and never smoking patients using disodium 2,2’-dithio-bis-ethane sulfonate (dimensa) and has been nationalized in the US, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, EU, China, Japan and Australia. The nominal expiration for NSCLC related patents and patent applications directed to LP-300 ranges from 2028 to as late as 2040 and does not account for any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We filed an additional PCT application in March 2020 directed to LP-300 and its application to NSCLC, as well as biomarkers that correlate to heightened response or sensitivity to LP-300. A recent application is directed to the use of LP-300 as a potential disulfide linker.
 
Confidentiality & Trade Secrecy
 
We enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators, contract research organizations, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. It is possible, however, that any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities’ relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. Third parties may also be able to develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, platforms or compounds, or otherwise gain access to our trade secret
Trademarks
 
We own various trademarks, applications and unregistered trademarks in the United States and other commercially important markets, including our company name, our A.I. platform, and certain compounds in development. Our trademark portfolio is designed to protect the brands for our Company, our A.I. platform and our portfolio of compounds.

Other Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property rights on the RADR® platform are valuable and important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure, and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Competition
 
We exist at the intersection of rapidly moving, global industries, namely, the biotechnology industry and the A.I. drug development industry. This is a unique and rapidly moving category with a variety of business models being developed globally. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. A.I. is disrupting and changing all industries, including the biotechnology industry. Although these are competitive industries, we believe we are uniquely positioned due to our focus on oncology drug development, prediction of patient response, use of computational biology, and the ability to both rescue and develop compounds.
 
We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 
Many of the companies against which we may compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines.
 
Any drug candidates we successfully develop will compete with current and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our drug candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, if any, the level of generic competition, level of promotional activity, intellectual property protection, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. If any drug candidates under development are approved for the indications in which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs in development.
 
Artificial Intelligence and Drug Development
 
We believe our proprietary RADR® platform gives us a significant competitive advantage by using AI to select and license drugs with a well-tolerated safety profile to quickly and cost-effectively bring drugs to market. Recently, there has been an increase in the use of AI for drug development that we face competition in both for developing new drugs and in biomarker development. This includes competition to the pool of already existing drug candidates that may be eligible for patient stratification. Our competition in AI-driven drug development for oncology includes, but is not limited to, the following:

● | Development of drug candidates: A2A Pharmaceuticals, AI Therapeutics, Atomwise, Benevolent AI, Berg Health, BioXcel, Celsius Therapeutics, Exscientia, Gritstone Oncology, Deep Genomics; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Development of biomarkers and/or signatures for patient stratification and improved drug development: Adaptive Biotechnologies, Concerto HealthAI, Datavant, Envisagenics, Erasca, and Genialis.

Pancreatic Cancer
 
There are approved standards of care agents for treating pancreatic cancer that are dominated by FOLFIRINOX (consisting of leucovorin calcium (folinic acid), fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and gemcitabine-based cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens. However, these regimens cause dose limiting toxicities. Liposomal irinotecan (Onivyde®) in combination with 5-FU and LV is recommended in patients that progressed on gemcitabine therapy. In a small subset of patients exhibiting genetic mutations such as those with neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusions, breast cancer gene (BRCA) 1/2 mutations, or patients with elevated microsatellite instability (MSI)-DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status, recently approved targeted therapies such as Vitrakvi and Rozlytrek (approximately 1% of pancreatic cancer patients), poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Lynparza (approximately 5-8% of pancreatic cancer patients) and Keytruda (approximately 1-2% of pancreatic cancer patients) are currently included in treatment guidelines. For eligible patients, paclitaxel (Abraxane®) or docetaxel has been used in the third-line setting in combination with gemcitabine. We believe that currently, no adequate treatment options are available for as much as 80% of advanced stage pancreatic cancer patients.
 
New agents are also being actively developed for the potential treatment of pancreatic cancer. The competition we may face regarding LP-184 for the potential treatment of pancreatic cancer includes without limitation the following agents that have not yet received marketing approval for the treatment of pancreatic cancer: the chemotherapeutic agent-glufosfamide; the CTGF inhibitor-FG-3019 (pamrevlumab); the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-Masiviera (masitinib); the KRAS inhibitor Sotorasib; and the PARP inhibitor Fluzoparib.
 
Glioblastoma
 
The standard treatment for glioblastoma includes radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Based on an article in the journal Genes and Diseases (Temozolomide resistance in glioblastoma multiforme, Genes Dis., 2016 May 11;3(3):198-210) and other publications, at least fifty percent of temozolomide treated patients do not respond to this treatment, and others often form resistance to temozolomide based regimens. Bevacizumab is frequently used for recurrent glioblastoma.
 
New agents are also being actively developed for the potential treatment of glioblastoma. The competition we may face regarding LP-184 for the potential treatment of glioblastoma includes without limitation the following: the chemotherapeutic agents Berubicin, and VAL-083 (Dianhydrogalactitol); and the protein kinase inhibitors Paxalisib, Stivarga (Regorafenib) and DB102 (Enzastaurin hydrochloride). There are also several immunotherapies in late-stage development for glioblastoma, including peptides and tumor cell vaccines.
 
Prostate Cancer
 
New agents are being actively developed to treat specific subtypes of prostate cancer. Our approach is to leverage A.I. and biomarker data to discover subtypes of prostate cancer and treatments for those subtypes of cancer. We believe our approach and our compounds take advantage of this improved characterization of prostate cancer.
 
There are approved standard of care agents for treating solid tumor prostate cancer, but there are a lack of approved therapeutic options for non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“nmCRPC”) patients and castration-resistant disease in metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer (“mHNPC”). The competition we may face in regards to LP-100 and one of the indications of LP-184, specifically mCRPC, includes without limitation the following drugs:
 

● | Astellas/Pfizer’s Xtandi (enzalutamide), Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga (abiraterone acetate), Clovis Oncology’s Rubraca (rucaparib), AstraZeneca’s Lynparza (olaparib), and Novartis’ Pluvicto (Lu-PSMA-617) are approved for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Xtandi Zytiga and Androgen Deprivation Therapy (“ADT”) to treat mHNPC and nmCRPC, respectively. 
● | Pfizer has tested Talazoparib and Enzalutamide to treat mCRPC 
● | BeiGene has used Pamiparib to treat mCRPC 
● | Millennium Pharmaceuticals has used ADT and TAK-700, a hormonal therapy that inhibits 17,20 lyase activity of the CYP17A1 enzyme, to treat Metastatic Prostate Cancer 

 
We believe LP-184 is unique and has promise for potential use in multiple proposed biomarker profile targeted indications where there are unmet treatment needs.
 

46
--

Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
 
We believe LP-300 may have an advantage to approved drugs on the market by serving as a well-tolerated agent in combination with multiple existing standards of care drugs for the NSCLC patient population or female NSCLC patient population. Beyond traditional chemotherapies (carboplatin/ pemetrexed and/or cisplatin/paclitaxel), NSCLC treatments with potential use for the never smoker patient population include targeted small molecules and biologics, which include, without limitation, the approved EGFR inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib; the approved ALK inhibitors brigatinib, ceritinib, and crizotinib; the approved MET inhibitor tepotinib; and the approved immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, and ramucirumab. Many of these agents are used in specific NSCLC subtypes either as single agents or in various combinations. Many patients with NSCLC receive treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI’s). Most patients treated with 1st or 2nd generation TKI’s will eventually develop resistance to treatment, therefore requiring additional therapeutic options. H002, a fourth generation EGFR inhibitor entering phase 1/ 2 trials may have potential for treatment of NSCLC subtypes with various EGFR activating mutations that are common among never smokers and that also underlie resistance to other therapies.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Our drug candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (“GCP”), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 


47
--


● | submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review; 
● | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing; 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and 
● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. 

 
The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical studies and clinical trials. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 
Preclinical Studies and IND
 
Preclinical studies generally involve laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical Trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
 
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III, and may overlap.
 

● | Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the drug candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
● | Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.

Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our drug candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our drug candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.
 
NDA Review Process
 
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug.
 
The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be marketed in the United States.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fiscal year 2022 fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA, was approximately $3.11 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug ($369,413 in 2022) and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a drug candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label use,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 

52
--

 

The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies; 
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 
● | applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments.
 
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. These laws include the following:
 

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
● | the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;

● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 
● | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

 
Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.

U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
European Union Drug Development
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (“NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees (“ECs”). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.

European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union (including Norway and excluding Croatia), Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (“SPC”), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 

 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (“SPCs”) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.

56
--

 

Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical drug candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), was passed which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.

Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA Congress has recently considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was enacted, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the “individual mandate” of the ACA is unconstitutional, but remanded the case to the U.S. District Court to reconsider whether the entire ACA is unconstitutional. In June 2021, the Supreme Court concluded that the challenge to the ACA should be dismissed. It is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and decisions, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.
 
Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
Moreover, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates.
