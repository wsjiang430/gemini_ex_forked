Description of Business
 
Service providers of all types are being challenged to deliver Gigabit speed bandwidth using fiber connections for a variety of uses--residential homes, businesses, and network infrastructure. Clearfield is focused on providing fiber management, fiber protection, and fiber delivery products that accelerate the turn-up of these fiber services in the wireline and wireless access network. We offer a broad portfolio of fiber products that allow service providers to build fiber networks faster, meet service delivery demands, and align build costs with take rates.
 
Our products allow our customers to connect twice as many homes in their Fiber to the Home (FTTH) builds by using fewer resources in less time. Our products speed up the time to revenue for our service provider customers in Multiple Dwelling Units (MDUs) and Multiple Tenant Units (MTUs) by reducing the amount of labor and materials needed to provide Gigabit service. Our products help make business services more profitable through faster building access, easier reconfiguration and quicker services turn-up. Finally, Clearfield is removing barriers to wireless small cell, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), and distributed antenna system (DAS) deployments through better fiber management, test access, and fiber protection.
 
By combining in-house engineering and technical knowledge alongside customers’ needs, the Company has been able to develop, customize and enhance products from design through production. Substantially all of the final build and assembly is completed at Clearfield’s plants in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota and Mexico, with manufacturing support from a network of domestic and global manufacturing partners. Clearfield specializes in producing these products on both a quick-turn and scheduled delivery basis.
 
On February 20, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of a portfolio of Telcordia certified outdoor active cabinet products from Calix, Inc. (“Calix”) upon the terms and conditions contained in an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 20, 2018. The introduction of the Clearfield active cabinet line provides customers a single point of contact for cabinet solutions—both passive and powered. The acquisition enables Clearfield to expand its Fiber-to-Anywhere expertise to include active powered electronic cabinet platforms while leveraging its supply chain. The acquisition also enables Clearfield to capitalize on and expand its reach to a broader customer base, including service providers in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets. Acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $10,350,000 which was comprised of a cash payment of $10,350,000 from the Company’s cash operating account. We assumed no liabilities in the acquisition.

Products
 
FieldSmart® is a series of panels, cabinets, wall boxes and other enclosures that house the Clearview components to provide a consistent design from the inside plant of the telco’s “central office” or cable television’s “head-end,” all the way through the outside plant to the access network to within the home or business. The central building block of FieldSmart is the patented technology surrounding the Clearview® Cassette.
 
WaveSmart® optical components are integrated for signal coupling, splitting, termination, multiplexing, demultiplexing and attenuation for a seamless integration within our fiber management platform. The products are built and tested for harsh environments to meet the strictest industry standards ensuring customers trouble-free performance in extreme outside plant conditions.
 
The ODC outdoor active cabinet product line was acquired from Calix in February 2018. This product line features a line of fully integrated, fully engineered cabinets equipped with specific active electronics configurations as well as Clearfield’s fiber management solutions housing the Clearview Cassette. These Clearfield ODC cabinets meet the rigorous demands of delivering information, communication, and entertainment services in an evolving, multi-media environment.
 
FieldShield® is a patented fiber pathway and protection method aimed at reducing the cost of broadband deployment. FieldShield takes industry standard glass and makes it easier and less expensive to install. FieldShield starts with a ruggedized microduct designed to support all aerial, direct bury, and inside plant “last mile” needs. Created from rugged high density polyethylene polymers, FieldShield Microduct is strong enough to be placed using traditional methods of boring and plowing, leveraging existing conduit placement equipment, as well as newer, less disruptive technologies such as micro trenching or saw cutting.
 
FieldShield Pushable Fiber easily slips through the microduct's smooth inner wall. Utilizing bend-insensitive glass, FieldShield Pushable Fiber is available in a variety of fiber counts, with bulk reels or factory terminated options offering total installation flexibility. A factory pre-connectorized FieldShield Pushable Connector eliminates costly labor in the field and presents reliable, consistent and guaranteed performance along with lower installation costs. FieldShield FLEXdrop, FieldShield Flat Drop, FieldShield D-ROP and FieldShield Strong Fiber, through the use of the Flexport and Flex Connector, provide same port connectivity regardless of the media being deployed.
 
The YOURx® Platform continues the Company theme of using a modular, building block approach with tool-less system design focusing on the fiber drop to the customer. The YOURx platform consists of hardened terminals, test access points, and multiple drop cable options designed for the most challenging portion of the access network across all fiber drop cable media.
 
CraftSmart® is a full line of optical protection field enclosures, extending Clearfield presence in the fiber industry. The CraftSmart Fiber Protection Pedestals (FPP) and CraftSmart Fiber Protection Vaults (FPV) are integrated solutions, optimized to house FieldSmart products at the last mile access point of the network in above-grade or below-grade installations. 
 
Clearfield manufactures high quality Fiber and Copper assemblies with an industry-standard or customer-specified configuration.  In addition, Clearfield’s engineering services team works alongside the engineering design departments of our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers to design and manufacture custom solutions for both in-the-box as well as network connectivity assemblies specific to that customer’s product line.

Markets and Customers
 
Clearfield’s products are sold across broadband service providers, which we categorize as Community Broadband (Tier 2 and 3 telco carriers, utilities, municipalities, and alternative carriers), National Carrier (wireless/wireless national telco carriers (Tier 1)), Multiple Service Operators (cable television), International (primarily Central/Latin America and Canada), and Legacy (primarily contract manufacturing).
FTTP
 Fiber to the Premise (also called Fiber to the Home) is a means of delivering the highest possible level of bandwidth directly to the user. The Company’s sales and marketing efforts have principally been focused on the U.S., with investments in Canada and Central/Latin America.
FTTB
 Fiber to the Business is the rapid expansion of fiber services, principally by Multiple Service Operators (cable television) and wireless/wireless national telco carriers (Tier 1) to penetrate the business marketplace.
 
FTT-Cell site
 Fiber to the Cell site is the trend in which wireless service providers are re-focusing their efforts from building towers for coverage to enhancing their coverage for bandwidth. Fiber is the medium of choice for their upgrade. Currently, the majority of these cell sites are served by fiber.
 
DAS
 A distributed-antenna system, or DAS, is a network of spatially separated antenna nodes connected to a common source via a transport medium that provides wireless service within a geographic area or structure. DAS antenna elevations are generally at or below the clutter level and node installations are compact. Fiber may be used to backhaul data from the antenna.
C-RAN
 C-RAN uses front-haul fiber to connect the Remote Radio Head (RRH) to a Baseband Unit (BBU) located in a datacenter (i.e., the cloud). C-RAN is an evolution of RAN cellular architecture that traditionally used fiber to backhaul signals from the BBU at a tower back to the mobile core network.
Build to Print
 In addition to a proprietary product line designed for the broadband service provider marketplace, Clearfield provides contract manufacturing services for original equipment manufacturers requiring copper and fiber cable assemblies built to their specification.
 
Competition
 
Competitors to the FieldSmart product lines include, but are not limited to, Corning Cabling Systems, Inc., OFS (Furukawa Electric North America, Inc.), AFL Telecommunications (a subsidiary of Fujikura Ltd.), Fujikura Ltd., Nokia, and CommScope, Inc. Competitors to the CraftSmart product line include Emerson Network Power, a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co., and Charles Industries, Ltd. Competitors to FieldShield include PPC Broadband, Inc. Nearly all of these firms are substantially larger than Clearfield and as a result may be able to procure necessary components and labor at much lower prices. Clearfield believes that it has a competitive advantage with customers who can leverage the cost savings the Clearview Cassette can provide and those who require quick-turn, high-performance customized products, and that it is at a competitive disadvantage with customers who principally seek large volume commodity products.

However, some components and outsourced labor are purchased from a single or a limited number of suppliers. The loss of access to some components and outsourced labor could have an adverse effect on our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and on our financial performance.
Major Customers and Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
 
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company had two customers that comprised 29%, 33%, and 35% of net sales, respectively. Both of these customers are distributors. These major customers, like our other customers, purchase our products from time to time through purchase orders, and we do not have any agreements that obligate these major customers to purchase products in the future from us.
 
As of September 30, 2019, two customers accounted for 28% of accounts receivable. Both of these customers were distributors. As of September 30, 2018, two customers accounted for 45% of accounts receivable. One of these customers was a distributor and one was a private label original equipment manufacturer.
 
The Company allocates sales from external customers to geographic areas based on the location to which the product is transported. Sales outside the United States are principally to customers in countries in the Caribbean, Canada, Central and South America.
