Fiscal 2022 Developments
In fiscal year 2022, the U.S. and global economies experienced unprecedented challenges resulting from the ongoing consequences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply chain bottlenecks and escalating inflation. These challenges were exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war which has led to further supply chain disruptions, rising energy costs and further inflationary impacts. These challenges have impacted our business as discussed below.
COVID-19 Pandemic, Variants Thereof, Recurrences or Similar Pandemics
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic and its variants continue to create challenges throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and variants thereof, the continued actions to contain it or treat its impact, including the success of COVID-19 vaccination programs, or recurrences of COVID-19 variants thereof or similar pandemics. As discussed in detail under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future pandemic outbreaks, we face material risks including, but not limited to the following: 
•The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any variants thereof and associated supply chain disruptions and inflation could result in a prolonged recession or depression in the United States or globally that could harm the banking system, limit or delay demand for many products and services and cause other foreseen and unforeseen events and circumstances, all of which could negatively impact us. 
•We experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty from both material increases and decreases in demand and pricing for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), drugs and other supplies directly related to treating and preventing the spread of COVID-19 and any variants thereof as well as a decline in demand and pricing for many supplies and services not related to COVID-19.
•Labor shortages and the resulting increases to cost of labor are a continued challenge to the healthcare providers we serve and could negatively affect our business. 
•While some of our hospital customers have increased access to their facilities for non-patients, including our field teams, consultants and other professionals, there are many that are still not allowing onsite access outside of their staff. Hospital imposed travel restrictions are also impacting some customers’ ability to participate in face-to-face events with us, such as committee meetings and conferences.
•The global supply chain has been materially disrupted due to personnel shortages associated with ongoing COVID-19 rates of infection, stay-at-home orders, border closings, rapidly escalating shipping costs, raw material availability and material logistical delays due to port congestion. 
•We have and may continue to receive requests for contract modifications, payment waivers and deferrals, payment reductions or amended payment terms from our contract counterparties. Inflation in such contract prices may impact member utilization of items and services available through our GPO contracts, with uncertain impact on our net administrative fees revenue and direct sourcing revenue. In addition, several pharmacy suppliers have exercised force majeure clauses related to failure to supply clauses in their contracts with us. 
•In response to COVID-19 and variants thereof, federal, state and local governments are issuing new rules, regulations, changing reimbursement eligibility rules, orders and advisories on a regular basis. These government actions can impact us, our members, other customers and suppliers.
Russia-Ukraine War
In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. As military activity continues and sanctions, export controls and other measures are imposed against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine, the war is increasingly affecting the global economy and financial markets, as well as exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation and energy costs and global supply-chain disruption. We continue to monitor the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on macroeconomic conditions and prepare for any implications that the war may have on member demand, our suppliers’ ability to deliver products, cybersecurity risks and our liquidity and access to capital. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Operations” below.
Impact of Inflation
The U.S. economy is experiencing the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s. Historically, we have not experienced significant inflation risk in our business arising from fluctuations in market prices across our diverse product portfolio. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover increases in our costs. In fiscal year 2022, our GPO business was not materially impacted by pricing inflation as we used our members’ aggregated purchasing power to negotiate firm prices in many of our contracts. In our direct sourcing business, we were able to partially offset increases in cost through temporary adjustments to selling prices and through various cost reduction initiatives while ensuring our products remain competitively priced. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Operations” below.
Industry Overview
According to data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), healthcare expenditures are a large component of the U.S. economy and are expected to grow by an average of 5.1% per year for the period 2021-2030, reaching 19.6% of gross domestic product, or GDP, by 2030. According to data from the 2020 American Hospital Association’s Annual Survey, published in the 2022 edition of the AHA Hospital Statistics™, there were more than 5,100 U.S. community hospitals with approximately 789,400 staffed beds in the United States. Of these acute care facilities, approximately 3,500 were part of either multi-hospital or diversified single hospital systems, meaning they were owned, leased, sponsored or contract managed by a central organization. Based upon 2021 reporting from the United States Department of Labor and healthcare industry sources, in addition to U.S. hospitals, there were approximately 817,000 facilities and providers across the continuum of care in the United States. These facilities include primary/ambulatory care and post-acute care providers. 
Healthcare Supply Chain Services Industry
According to CMS data, total spending on hospital services in the United States is projected to be $1.4 trillion, or approximately 32% of total healthcare expenditures, in calendar year 2022. Expenses associated with the hospital supply chain, such as supplies as well as operational and capital expenditures, typically represent a material portion of a hospital’s budget. With continued reimbursement rate pressure across government and managed care payors, a transitioning payment model from fee-for-service to value-based payment, and national health expenditures representing a material portion of the economy, healthcare providers are examining all sources of cost savings, with supply chain spending a key area of focus. We believe opportunities to drive cost out of the healthcare supply chain include improved pricing for medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, purchased services, facilities expenditures, food service supplies, and information technology, as well as appropriate resource utilization, mitigating pharmaceuticals and medical device shortages and increased operational efficiency.
From origination at the supplier to final consumption by the provider or patient, healthcare products pass through an extensive supply chain incorporating manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, GPOs, pharmacy benefit managers, and retail, long-term care and integrated pharmacies, among others. In response to the national focus on health spending and managing healthcare costs, supply chain participants are seeking more convenient and cost-efficient ways to deliver products to patients and providers. We believe that improvements to the healthcare supply chain to bring it on par with other industries that have more sophisticated supply chain management can drive out material inefficiencies and cost.
Healthcare Performance Services Industry
State and federal budget pressures stemming from increased deficit spending and employer and consumer demands for lower costs, and the need for improved quality and outcomes have generated greater focus among healthcare providers on cost management, quality and safety, and value-based care. As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has embarked on an aggressive effort over the past three administrations to move from fee-for-service to alternative payment models (“APMs”). APMs, such as accountable care organizations (“ACOs”), capitated and bundled payment arrangements, make healthcare providers more accountable for cost and quality goals. This movement was advanced further with the bipartisan enactment of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which created incentives for physicians to move to APMs. Even with the possibility of changes to the ACA, this movement has and will likely continue given the strong bipartisan support for these models. Over the long-term, health systems will need to continually monitor performance and manage costs, while demonstrating high levels of quality and implementing new care delivery models.
We expect information technology to continue to play a key enabling role in workflow efficiency and cost reduction, performance improvement and care delivery transformation across the healthcare industry. In particular, the trends toward value-based payment models and healthcare require more sophisticated business intelligence, expanded data sets and technology solutions. To achieve higher-quality outcomes and control total cost of care, providers exhibit a strong and continuing need for more comprehensive data and analytic capabilities to help them understand their current and future performance, identify opportunities for improvement and manage value-based care risk. We expect demand for data 
management and data analytics products to complement the focus on electronic health record adoption. Similarly, our consulting services business is growing in the areas of business model strategy and redesign, process and margin improvement, labor productivity, non-labor cost management, clinical integration and change management.
Our Membership
Our current membership base includes many of the country’s most progressive and forward-thinking healthcare organizations. The participation of these organizations in our membership provides us additional insights into the latest challenges confronting the industry we serve and innovative best practices that we can share broadly throughout our membership. We continually seek to add new members that are at the forefront of innovation in the healthcare industry. At June 30, 2022, our members included more than 4,400 U.S. hospitals and health systems and approximately 250,000 other providers and organizations. Over 430 individuals, representing approximately 140 of our U.S. hospital members, sit on 29 of our strategic and sourcing committees, and as part of these committees, use their industry expertise to advise on ways to improve the development, quality and value of our products and services. In addition, at June 30, 2022, four senior executives from our U.S. hospital member systems served on our Board of Directors providing valuable and unique insights into the challenges faced by hospitals and hospital systems and the innovations necessary to address these challenges. No individual member or member systems accounted for more than 5% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Total GPO purchasing volume by all members participating in our GPO was more than $82 billion and $69 billion for the calendar years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to retention rates for members participating in our GPO in the Supply Chain Services segment and renewal rates for our SaaS informatics products subscriptions and licenses in the Performance Services segment for the fiscal years shown:

 | Year Ended June 30, | 
 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 3 Year Average
GPO retention rate (a)(b) | 97% | 94% | 99% | 97% 
SaaS institutional renewal rate (c) | 96% | 96% | 95% | 96% 

_________________________________
(a)The GPO retention rate is calculated based upon the aggregate purchasing volume among all members participating in our GPO for such fiscal year less the annualized GPO purchasing volume for departed members for such fiscal year, divided by the aggregate purchasing volume among all members participating in our GPO for such fiscal year.
(b)Fiscal 2021 GPO retention rate decreased primarily as a result of amendments to GPO participation agreements, effective July 1, 2020, and the August 2020 Restructuring.
(c)The SaaS institutional renewal rate is calculated based upon the total number of members that have SaaS or license revenue in a given period that also have revenue in the corresponding prior year period divided by the total number of members that have SaaS or license revenue in the same period of the prior year.
Our Business Segments
We deliver our integrated platform of solutions that address the areas of clinical intelligence, margin improvement and value-based care and manage our business through two business segments: Supply Chain Services and Performance Services. Refer to Note 19 - Segments to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information. We have no significant foreign operations or revenues.
Supply Chain Services
Our Supply Chain Services segment assists our members and other customers in managing their non-labor expense and capital spend through a combination of products, services and technologies, including one of the largest national healthcare GPO programs in the United States serving acute, non-acute and non-healthcare sites, and providing supply chain co-management, purchased services and direct sourcing activities. Membership in our GPO also provides access to certain SaaS informatics products related to the supply chain and the opportunity to participate in our ASCEND® and SURPASS® performance groups. Our Supply Chain Services segment consists of the following products and solutions:
Group Purchasing. Our portfolio of over 3,000 contracts with over 1,460 suppliers provides our members with access to a wide range of products and services, including medical and surgical products, pharmaceuticals, laboratory supplies, capital equipment, information technology, facilities and construction, food and nutritional products and purchased services (such as clinical engineering and workforce solutions). We use our members’ aggregate purchasing power to negotiate pricing discounts and improved contract terms with suppliers. Contracted suppliers pay us administrative fees based on the purchase volume of goods and services sold to our members under the contracts we have negotiated. We also partner with other organizations, including regional GPOs, to extend our network base to their members.
Our contract portfolio is designed to offer our members a flexible solution comprised of multi-sourced supplier contracts, as well as pre-commitment and/or single-sourced contracts that offer higher discounts. Our multi-sourced contracts offer pricing tiers based on purchasing volume and/or commitment and multiple suppliers for many products and services. Our pre-commitment contracts require that a certain amount of our members commit in advance to a specified amount or percentage of purchasing volume before we enter into a contract with a particular supplier. Our single-source contracts are entered into with a specified supplier, and through this exclusive relationship, allow us to contract for products that meet our members’ specifications. In the case of pre-commitment contracts, we provide the particular supplier with a list of members that have pre-committed to a specified amount or percentage of purchasing volume and the supplier directly handles the tracking and monitoring of fulfillment of such purchasing volume. In the case of single and multi-sourced contracts, we negotiate and execute the contracts with suppliers on behalf of our members and make such contracts available to our members to access. The utilization of such single and multi-sourced contracts is determined by each particular member with assistance from our field force. Since there are no specific fulfillment requirements needed in our single and multi-source contracts in order to obtain certain pricing levels, each particular member and supplier agree on the appropriate pricing tier based on expected purchasing volume with tracking and ongoing validation of such purchasing volume provided by the supplier. The flexibility provided by our expansive contract portfolio allows us to effectively address the varying needs of our members and the significant number of factors that influence and dictate these needs, including overall size, service mix, and the degree of integration between hospitals in a healthcare system.
We continually innovate our GPO programs and supply chain platforms while targeting multiple markets, including acute and non-acute care and non-healthcare site settings. In addition to our core base of approximately 4,400 acute care healthcare providers, our Premier Continuum of Care Program, one of the largest in the United States, which covers over 80 classes of trade, had approximately 250,000 active members as of June 30, 2022, which represents an increase of approximately 25,000 members, or 11%, over fiscal year 2021. A number of these members in our Premier Continuum of Care Program are affiliated, owned, leased, or managed by our members and received a revenue share from us based upon our collected gross administrative fees on their members’ purchases. 
Our Premier Continuum of Care Program includes the following:
Premier Continuum of Care - Non-Acute Care. This program includes direct members, group affiliates and healthcare provider offices owned, leased or managed by health systems. Key classes of trade include long-term care dispensing pharmacies, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, home infusion providers, home health providers and surgery centers. Premier Continuum of Care members have access to most of our GPO supplier contracts, including, but not limited to, pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical supplies, facilities, food and nutritional products and other purchased services. 
Premier Business and Industry - Non-Healthcare. This program includes direct members and group affiliates. Key classes of trade include non-healthcare entities, such as education (e.g. K-12 schools, colleges and universities), hospitality, recreation (e.g. stadiums, parks and fairgrounds), and employee food programs. Our Business and Industry members have access to most of our GPO supplier contracts, including administrative services, facilities, food service, and informational services.
The Premier Continuum of Care Program provides business operations and technology to ensure members and other customers are connected to agreements and receiving proper contracted pricing. 
Supply Chain Co-Management. We manage and co-manage the supply chain operations for members to drive down costs through processes, including value analysis, product standardization and strategic resource allocation and improved operational efficiency. 
Purchased Services Contracts. Our purchased services contracts business, which is separate from the purchased services under our national contract portfolio, includes Conductiv, Inc. (“Conductiv”) and Conductiv Contracts, LLC (“Conductiv Contracts”). Conductiv is a SaaS provider of technology solutions and expert services that enable hospitals and other organizations to analyze, benchmark and source purchased service contracts independent of any existing GPO affiliation. Combined with our purchased services spend data and our performance improvement technology suite, we are able to be a single source provider for healthcare margin improvement. Conductiv Contracts is a regionally focused group purchasing organization independent of any existing GPO affiliation that exclusively focuses on purchased services contracting.
Direct Sourcing. Our direct sourcing business, SVS, LLC d/b/a S2S Global (“S2S Global”), helps our members and other customers access a diverse product portfolio and helps provide transparency to manufacturing costs and competitive pricing. Through our consolidated subsidiary, S2S Global, we facilitate the development of product specifications with our members and other customers, source or contract manufacture the products to member specifications and sell products directly to our members, other customers or distributors. By engaging with our members and other customers at the 
beginning of the sourcing process to define product specifications and then sourcing, or contract manufacturing, products to meet the exact needs of our members, we eliminate the need for unnecessary product features and specifications that may typically be included by suppliers and result in higher prices for our members without providing incremental value. Therefore, our direct sourcing activities benefit our members and other customers by providing them with an expanding portfolio of medical products through more efficient means, and with greater cost transparency, than if such products were purchased from other third-party suppliers. We market our direct sourcing activities to our members primarily under the PREMIERPRO® brand.
Supply Chain Resiliency Program. In partnership with our members, we have created a program designed to promote domestic and geographically diverse manufacturing and ensure a robust and resilient supply chain for essential medical products. The program is intended to provide a means to invest in or partner with businesses that can supply shortage products, co-fund the development of affordable products that address specific market needs and create strategic sourcing contracts to ensure continuous supply for our members and customers. We believe this program is most successful when we are able to partner with our members through investments or long-term purchasing commitments on these initiatives. 
Our Supply Chain Resiliency Program includes, but is not limited to, the following:
PRAM Holdings, LLC. We formed PRAM Holdings, LLC (“PRAM”) in 2020 in partnership with our members to invest in Prestige Ameritech Ltd. (“Prestige”), a domestic manufacturer of masks and other PPE, whereby our members obtain a direct domestic source to critical PPE. 
DePre Holdings, LLC. We formed DePre Holdings, LLC (“DPH”) in 2021 in partnership with our members to invest in DePre, LLC (“DePre”), a joint venture between DPH and DeRoyal Industries Inc., a global medical manufacturer, whereby our members obtain a direct source dedicated to the domestic production of isolation gowns. 
ExPre Holdings, LLC. We formed ExPre Holdings, LLC (“ExPre”) in 2022 in partnership with our members to invest in Exela Holdings, Inc. (“Exela”), a domestic manufacturer of proprietary and generic sterile injectable products, whereby our members obtain a direct source to certain critical pharmaceutical products. 
SaaS Informatics Products. Members of our GPO have access to certain SaaS informatics products related to the supply chain and have the ability to purchase additional elements that are discussed in more detail below under “Our Business Segments - Performance Services”. 
Performance Groups. Our Performance Groups are highly committed purchasing programs, which enable members to benefit from coordinated purchasing decisions and maintain standardization across their facilities. Our Performance Groups include the ASCEND® and the SURPASS® Performance Groups. 
ASCEND® Performance Group. Our ASCEND Performance Group, which was rebranded as ASCENDriveTM as of July 1, 2022, has developed a process to aggregate purchasing data for our members, enabling such members to benefit from committed group purchases within the Performance Group. Through our ASCEND Performance Group, members receive group purchasing programs, tiers and prices specifically negotiated for them and knowledge sharing with other member participants. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 1,300 U.S. hospital members, which represent over 113,000 hospital beds, participated in the ASCEND Performance Group. These hospital member participants have identified approximately $712.0 million in additional savings as compared to their U.S. hospital peers not participating in the ASCEND Performance Group since its inception in 2009. For calendar year 2021, these member participants had approximately $21.3 billion in annual supply chain purchasing spend.
SURPASS® Performance Group. Our SURPASS Performance Group builds upon and complements our legacy ASCEND Performance Group and drives even greater savings for members at a correspondingly higher level of commitment. The SURPASS Performance Group brings together our most committed members that are able to coordinate purchasing decisions, review utilization and achieve and maintain standardization across their facilities. The SURPASS Performance Group utilizes our PACER (Partnership for the Advancement of Comparative Effectiveness Review) methodology, which brings together clinically led cohorts to make evidence-based decisions about physician and clinician preference items with the goal of materially reducing the total cost of care. As of June 30, 2022, a group of 23 members representing approximately 470 acute care sites and 9,700 alternate sites participate in our SURPASS Performance Group. These hospital member participants have identified over $206.0 million in additional savings via their efforts in more than 150 categories. The SURPASS Performance Group has another 30 potential categories slated for the coming year as well as select initiatives related to utilization and standardization. For calendar year 2021, these member participants had approximately $11.2 billion in annual supply chain purchasing spend.
E-Commerce Platform. Our E-Commerce platform, STOCKDTM, is part of our multi-channel supply chain strategy, which provides a digital sales channel where members and other customers can purchase products under our PREMIERPRO brand as well as utilize limited savings programs from Premier GPO suppliers utilizing an e-commerce platform.  
PROVIDEGXTM Program. The PROVIDEGX program identifies high-quality supply sources for drugs that are on or may be at risk of being added to the national drug shortage list or that are vulnerable to pricing volatility. The PROVIDEGX program is the next step in our ongoing effort to help facilitate the availability of high-quality pharmaceutical products, including drugs for which there may be supply challenges.
Performance Services
Our Performance Services segment consists of three sub-brands: PINC AI, Contigo Health and Remitra. Each serves different markets but are all united in our vision to optimize provider performance and accelerate industry innovation for better, smarter healthcare. Our PINC AI platform enables us to better reflect our current product offerings and strategy to expand and incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) across our portfolio of solutions. This platform further enables connectivity and scale between providers, the life sciences industry and payors, including large employers, to help lower the cost and improve the quality of care. We believe that we house one of the largest clinical, operational and financial datasets in the United States which enables actionable insight and real-world evidence needed to accelerate healthcare improvements. We currently incorporate AI into prior authorization between payors and providers and clinical intelligence through the decision support process which helps key healthcare stakeholders improve the quality, efficiency and value of healthcare delivery. Using our data and scale, we seek to expand our AI capabilities, grow our overall portfolio of solutions and provide our members and customers with technologically advanced products so they can provide better, smarter healthcare. 
PINC AI: 
With a broad provider network, advanced analytics, and the incorporation and desired expansion of AI-powered technology backed by our large dataset, we believe PINC AI has the ability to accelerate ingenuity in healthcare. 
PINC AI helps optimize provider performance in three main areas – clinical intelligence, margin improvement and value-based care – using advanced analytics to identify improvement opportunities, consulting services for clinical and operational design and workflow solutions to hardwire sustainable change. 
Clinical intelligence solutions help drive greater clinical effectiveness and efficiency across the care continuum by:
•Surfacing analytics and peer benchmarking on hard-to-find, high-value quality improvement areas, helping providers improve care delivery; 
•Delivering real-time clinical surveillance to help providers drive faster, more informed decisions around patient safety, including ongoing infection prevention (like COVID-19), antimicrobial stewardship, and reduction of hospital acquired conditions; 
•Using AI-enabled clinical decision support integrated into the provider workflow (EHR) to support evidence-based decisions by providers at the point of care, and improve prior authorization automation; 
•Operating the QUEST Collaborative, which works to develop quality, safety and cost metrics with a consistency and standardization. We believe participation in the QUEST Collaborative better prepares providers to deal with evolving and uncertain healthcare reform requirements and differentiate on care delivery in their markets; and
•Providing life sciences services through Premier Applied Science® for the development of research, real-world evidence and clinical trials innovation for medical device, diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies.
Margin improvement solutions help lower total costs and improve provider operating margins by: 
•Surfacing analytics and peer benchmarking on hard-to-find, supply savings and workforce management opportunities that lower costs without impacting quality;
•Optimizing workforce management with integrated financial reporting and budgeting across the continuum of care;
•Providing savings through an enterprise resource planning solution built specifically for healthcare; 
•Deploying consulting services to deliver clinically integrated, margin improvement transformation throughout a health system; and
•Providing management services to insurance programs to assist U.S. hospital and healthcare system members with liability and benefits insurance services, along with risk management services to improve their quality, patient safety and financial performance while lowering costs.
Value-based care solutions help health systems implement effective models of care to succeed in new, value-based payment arrangements by: 
•Surfacing analytics and peer benchmarking to help identify hard-to-find, population-based improvement opportunities necessary to take financial risk and succeed in value-based care; 
•Optimizing and managing the Physician enterprise to rationalize medical group investment via revenue enhancement, cost reduction strategies and implementation of sustainable evidence-based practices; and 
•Participating in the Population Health Management, Bundled Payment and Physician Enterprise Collaboratives, for the opportunity to share value-based care and payment developmental strategies, programs and best practices. 
The data yielded through PINC AI is de-identified and aggregated in what we believe to be the nation’s leading comprehensive database, representing over 20 years of data from more than 1,000 hospitals spanning multiple therapeutic areas. A research team including clinicians, epidemiologists, health economists, health services researchers, statisticians and other subject matter experts leverage the dataset to deliver real world evidence, in partnership with Life Science innovators. Studies, test methods, strategies and tools created can promote the adoption and integration of evidence-based practices to help improve outcomes and the quality and effectiveness of care. 
Contigo Health:
Contigo Health creates new ways for clinicians, health systems and employers to work together supporting a common goal for all stakeholders: to help increase access to high-quality care, enhance employee engagement, control costs and get employees back to work and life faster. Contigo Health delivers comprehensive services for optimizing employee health benefits, including: 
•The Contigo Health Employer Centers of Excellence Network, which through partnerships with some of the nation’s top clinicians, helps to provide care through access to the highest quality outcomes for a bundled cost;

•Remitra’s Procure-to-Pay platform, a cloud-based platform which powers supplier and provider networks and uses optical character recognition to automate invoicing and payables. Remitra seeks to streamline financial processes, reduce errors and fraud, unlock cost and labor efficiencies and become a leading digital invoicing and payables platform for all of healthcare, agnostic of ERP, GPO or treasury partner. 
•Remitra’s Cash Flow Optimizer platform, a financial solution for suppliers and providers which leverages Remitra’s cloud-based procure to pay platform and provides opportunities for financial improvements including a reduction in days sales outstanding, on-time payments, improved working capital and a potential reduction over time of allowance of credit losses associated with bad debt.
Pricing and Contracts
We generate revenue from our Supply Chain Services segment through administrative fees received from suppliers based on the total dollar volume of goods and services purchased by our members and other customers in connection with our GPO programs, service fees from supply chain co-management, subscription fees from purchased services and through product sales 
in connection with our direct sourcing activities. We generate revenue from our Performance Services segment through our three sub-brands: PINC AI, Contigo Health and Remitra. 
Supply Chain Services
Our GPO generates revenue through administrative fees received from contracted suppliers for a percentage of the purchase price of goods and services, including purchased services activities, sold to members under negotiated supplier contracts. Pursuant to the terms of GPO participation agreements entered into by the members, our members currently receive revenue share based upon purchasing by such member’s owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through our GPO supplier contracts.
The majority of our current GPO participation agreements with our members have terms that commenced in July 2020 and primarily range from five to seven years. Generally, our GPO participation agreements may not be terminated except for cause or in the event of a change of control of the GPO member. The GPO member can terminate the GPO participation agreement at the end of the then-current term by notifying Premier LP of the member’s decision not to renew. Our GPO participation agreements generally provide for liquidated damages in the event of a termination not otherwise permitted under the agreement. Due to competitive market conditions, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience requests, at times, to provide existing and prospective members increases in revenue share on incremental and/or overall purchasing volume. 
In our supply chain co-management activities, we earn revenue in the form of a service fee for services performed under the supply chain management contracts. Service fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed.
In our purchased services activities, we generate revenue through administrative fees, as described above, and subscription fees. Subscription fees, which we generate through our SaaS-based products, are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. 
In our direct sourcing activities, we earn revenue from product sales, including sales from aggregated purchases of certain products, as well as, in some cases, service or licensing fees. Products are sold to our members and other customers through direct shipment and distributor and wholesale channels. Products are also sold to regional medical-surgical distributors and other non-healthcare industries (i.e., foodservice). We have contracts with our members and other customers that buy products through our direct shipment option, which usually do not provide a guaranteed purchase or volume commitment requirement. 
Performance Services
Performance Services revenue consists of revenue generated through our three sub-brands: PINC AI, Contigo Health and Remitra. The main sources of revenue under PINC AI are (i) subscription agreements to our SaaS-based clinical analytics products, (ii) enterprise analytics licensing revenue, (iii) professional fees for our consulting services and (iv) other miscellaneous revenue including annual subscriptions to our performance improvement collaboratives, insurance management service fees and commissions from insurance carriers for sponsored insurance programs. Contigo Health’s main sources of revenue are third party administrator fees and fees from the centers of excellence program and Remitra’s main source of revenue is fees from healthcare product suppliers and service providers. 
PINC AI:
SaaS-based clinical analytics products subscriptions include the right to access our proprietary hosted technology on a SaaS basis, training and member support to deliver improvements in cost management, margin improvement, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. Pricing varies by application and size of the healthcare system. Clinical analytics products subscriptions are generally three- to five-year agreements with automatic renewal clauses and annual price escalators that typically do not allow for early termination. These agreements do not allow for physical possession of the software. Subscription fees are typically billed on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized as a single deliverable on a straight-line basis over the remaining contractual period following implementation. Implementation involves the completion of data preparation services that are unique to each member's data set and, in certain cases, the installation of member site-specific software, in order to access and transfer member data into our hosted SaaS-based clinical analytics products. Implementation is generally 60 to 240 days following contract execution before the SaaS-based clinical analytics products can be fully utilized by the member.
Enterprise analytics licenses include term licenses that range from three to ten years and offer clinical analytics products, improvements in cost management, quality and safety, value-based care and provider analytics. Pricing varies by application and size of healthcare system. Revenue on licensing is recognized upon delivery of the license and revenue from hosting and maintenance is recognized ratably over the life of the contract.
Professional fees for consulting services are sold under contracts, the terms of which vary based on the nature of the engagement. These services typically include general consulting, report-based consulting and cost savings initiatives. Fees are billed as stipulated in the contract, and revenue is recognized on a proportional performance method as services are performed or when deliverables are provided. In situations where the contracts have significant contract performance guarantees or member acceptance provisions, revenue recognition occurs when the fees are fixed and determinable and all contingencies, including any refund rights, have been satisfied. Fees are based either on the savings that are delivered or a fixed fee.
Revenue from performance improvement collaboratives that support our offerings in cost management, quality and safety and value-based care is recognized over the service period as the services are provided, which is generally one year.
Insurance management service fees are recognized in the period in which such services are provided. Commissions from insurance carriers for sponsored insurance programs are earned by acting as an intermediary in the placement of effective insurance policies. Under this arrangement, revenue is recognized at a point in time on the effective date of the associated policies when control of the policy transfers to the customer and is constrained for estimated early terminations.
Contigo Health:
Contigo Health revenue consists of third party administrator fees and fees from the centers of excellence program. Third party administrator fees consist of integrated fees for the processing of self-insured health care plan claims. Third party administrator fees are invoiced to customers monthly and typically collected in that period. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided. Fees from the centers of excellence program consist of administrative fees for access to a specialized care network of proven healthcare providers. Centers of excellence fees are invoiced to customers a month in arrears and typically collected in that period. Revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided. 
Remitra
Revenue for Remitra primarily consists of fees from healthcare product suppliers and service providers. Fees for services are invoiced to our customers monthly and typically collected in the following period. For fixed fee contracts, revenue is recognized in the period in which the services have been provided. For variable rate contracts, revenue is recognized as customers are invoiced. Additional revenue consists of fees from check replacement services which consist of monthly rebates from bank partners. 
Revenue Concentration
Our customers consist of members and other healthcare businesses and non-healthcare businesses such as food service, schools and universities. Our top five customers generated revenue of approximately 21% and 28% of our consolidated net revenues for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenue generated from our largest customer, a non-healthcare customer in the Supply Chain Services segment, was approximately 15% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021. The significant increase in revenue concentration and revenue generated from our largest customer was due to the greater than normal purchases of products through our direct sourcing business by such customer primarily as of result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other than the aforementioned customer, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenue during each of the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.
Intellectual Property
We offer our members a range of products to which we have appropriate intellectual property rights, including online services, best practices content, databases, electronic tools, web-based applications, performance metrics, business methodologies, proprietary algorithms, software products and consulting services deliverables. We own and control a variety of trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights that, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business.
We protect our intellectual property by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual arrangements. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
Research and Development
Our research and development (“R&D”) expenditures primarily consist of our strategic investment in internally developed software to develop new and enhance existing SaaS- and license-based products offerings and new product development in the areas of cost management, quality and safety and value-based care. From time to time, we may experience fluctuations in our research and development expenditures, including capitalized software development costs, across reportable periods due to the timing of our software development life cycles, with new product features and functionality, new technologies and upgrades to our service offerings.
Information Technology and Cybersecurity Risk Management
We rely on digital technology to conduct our business operations and engage with our members and business partners. The technology we, our members, and business partners use grows more complex over time as do threats to our business operations from cyber intrusions, denial of service attacks, manipulation and other cyber misconduct. Through a risk management approach that continually assesses and improves our Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity risk deterrence capabilities, our Information Security and Risk Management groups have formed a functional collaboration to provide leadership and oversight when managing IT and cybersecurity risks. 
Through a combination of Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) resources, we (i) proactively monitor IT controls to better ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (ii) assess adherence by third parties we partner with to ensure that the appropriate risk management standards are met, (iii) ensure essential business functions remain available during a business disruption, and (iv) monitor and continually develop and update response plans to address potential weaknesses and IT or cyber incidents should they occur. Our GRC resources are designed to prioritize IT and cybersecurity risks areas, identify solutions that minimize such risks, pursue optimal outcomes and maintain compliance with contractual obligations. We also maintain an operational security function that has a real time 24x7x365 response capability that triages incident management and triggers impact mitigation protocols. These capabilities allow us to apply best practices and reduce exposure in the case of a security incident. For more information regarding the risks associated with these matters, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-We could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to material liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third parties.”
Competition
The markets for our products and services in both our Supply Chain Services segment and Performance Services segment are fragmented, highly competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product standards, user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense competition from a number of companies. 
Our Supply Chain Services segment’s competitors primarily compete with our group purchasing and direct sourcing activities. Our group purchasing business competes with other large GPOs such as HealthTrust Purchasing Group (a subsidiary of HCA Holdings, Inc.), Managed Health Care Associates, Inc. and Vizient, Inc. In addition, we compete against certain healthcare provider-owned GPOs and on-line retailers in this segment. Our direct sourcing business competes primarily with private label offerings/programs, product manufacturers, and distributors, such as Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corporation, Medline Industries, Inc. and Owens & Minor, Inc.
Our Performance Services segment’s competitors compete with our three sub-brands: PINC AI, Contigo Health and Remitra. The primary competitors of PINC AI range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically sophisticated entities. Our primary competitors for PINC AI include (i) information technology providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., Change Healthcare, Epic Systems Corporation, Health Catalyst, Inc., IBM Corporation, Infor, Inc. and Oracle Corporation, and (ii) consulting and outsourcing firms such as Deloitte & Touche LLP, Evolent Health, Inc., Healthagen, LLC (a subsidiary of Aetna, Inc.), Huron Consulting, Inc., Guidehouse Consulting, Inc., Optum, Inc. (a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, Inc.) and Vizient, Inc. The primary competitors for Contigo Health include AmeriBen, Meritan Health, UMR, WebTPA and Benefit and Risk Management Services for our third party administrative services product, and Carrum Health, Bridge Health, Edison Healthcare, AccessHope and MSK Direct for our Centers of Excellence product. The primary competitors for Remitra include Global Healthcare Exchange, LLC and Prodigo Solutions, Inc. for our digital invoicing product and Coupa Software Inc. and Taulia for our digital payables product. 
With respect to our products and services across both segments, we compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvements through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand 
recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. With respect to our products and services across both of our business segments, we also compete on the basis of price. 
Government Regulation
General
The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing legal, political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of healthcare organizations. In particular, changes in laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as increased regulation of the purchase and sale of medical products, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements, could require us to make unplanned and costly modifications to our products and services, and may result in delays or cancellations of orders or a reduction of funds and demand for our products and services.
We are subject to numerous risks arising from governmental oversight and regulation. You should carefully review the following discussion and the risks discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a more detailed discussion.
Affordable Care Act 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) is a sweeping law designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. The law includes provisions to tie Medicare provider reimbursement to healthcare quality and incentives, mandatory compliance programs, enhanced transparency disclosure requirements, increased funding and initiatives to address fraud and abuse and incentives to state Medicaid programs to promote community-based care as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. In addition, the law created of an innovation center to test and scale new APMs and ACOs. These programs are creating fundamental changes in the delivery of healthcare. Likewise, many states have adopted or are considering changes in healthcare policies in part due to state budgetary shortfalls. Ongoing uncertainty regarding implementation of certain aspects of the ACA makes it difficult to predict the impact the ACA or state law proposals may have on our business. While certain aspects of the ACA remain subject to uncertainty in implementation, in a shift from the ACA’s treatment under the previous administration, which sought to repeal the ACA and eliminate many of its key provision by any means possible, the Biden administration has promoted and expressed support for the ACA. Moreover, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed, for lack of standing, a challenge to the ACA brought by the Trump administration and a group of state Attorneys General thereby leaving the ACA intact. The Biden administration has identified that it will seek to undo certain of the restrictions placed on the ACA under the Trump administration, which may result in further changes to and re-broadening of formerly limited provisions. Any future changes may ultimately impact the provisions of the ACA or other laws or regulations that either currently affect, or may in the future affect, our business. We believe it is important to note that most of the controversy related to the ACA relates to coverage expansion and not the issues related to quality improvement and cost reduction.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) extensively regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. To the extent that functionality or intended use in one or more of our current or future software products causes the software to be regulated as a medical device under existing or future FDA laws or regulations including the 21st Century Cures Act, which addresses, among other issues, the patient safety concerns generated by cybersecurity risks to medical devices and the interoperability between medical devices, we could be required to:
•register our company and list our FDA-regulated products with the FDA;
•obtain pre-market approval establishing the safety and efficacy of our regulated products or clearance from the FDA based on demonstration of substantial equivalence to a legally marketed device before marketing our regulated products;
•obtain an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) prior to conducting clinical trials with the regulated products;
•obtain FDA approval by demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the regulated products prior to commercial marketing;
•submit to pre-market approval or post-market inspections by the FDA; and
•comply with various FDA regulations, including the agency’s quality system regulation, complaint handling and medical device reporting regulations, requirements for medical device modifications, increased rigor of the secure development life cycle in the development of medical devices and the interoperability of medical devices and 
electronic health records, requirements for clinical investigations or post-market studies, corrections and removal reporting regulations, and post-market surveillance regulations.
A new medical device must be cleared or approved by FDA through the pre-market approval (“PMA”) or 510(k) clearance. For medical devices that require a PMA, clinical studies performed under an IDE will become part of a PMA for a medical device.
Once a medical device product requiring a PMA is identified for development, it enters the feasibility study stage. For significant risk devices, including devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health, sponsors must submit an investigational plan to the FDA as part of the IDE. The IDE automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. An IDE sponsor typically must submit results of feasibility studies to FDA to receive approval to proceed with a pivotal study. A pivotal study is generally intended as the primary clinical support for a marketing application.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) regulations. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IDE, and progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually. In addition, timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Medical devices typically rely on one or a few pivotal studies. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (“IRB”). An IRB responsible for the research conducted at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
The FDA, the IRB, or we could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits or a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the device has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new medical device, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IDE and before a PMA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of feasibility studies to plan for their pivotal trial or trials for a medical device.
Appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Before approving a PMA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in full compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of FDA regulated products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) (21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq.).
Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP and other laws. Manufacturers may have to provide, on request, electronic or physical records regarding their establishments. Delaying, denying, limiting, or refusing inspection by the FDA may lead to a product being deemed to be adulterated.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes for Medical Devices
Unless an exemption applies, medical devices commercially distributed in the United States require either premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance, or approval of a PMA application from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices, considered to have the lowest risk, are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable 
portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials (“General Controls”). Class II devices are subject to the FDA's General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device (“Special Controls”). Manufacturers of most Class II and some Class I devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. The submission of a 510(k) or PMA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
510(k) Clearance Pathway for Medical Devices
When a 510(k) clearance is required, an applicant is required to submit a 510(k) application demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMAs. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny a 510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance may take longer. Typically, the FDA’s response after reviewing a 510(k) application is a request for additional data or clarification. Depending on the complexity of the application and the amount of data required, the process may be lengthened by several months or more. If additional data, including clinical data, are needed to support our claims, the 510(k) application process may be significantly lengthened. 
If the FDA issues an order declaring the device to be Not Substantially Equivalent (“NSE”), the device is placed into a Class III or PMA category. At that time, a manufacturer can request a de novo classification of the product. De novo generally applies where there is no predicate device and the FDA believes the device is sufficiently safe so that no PMA should be required. The request must be in writing and sent within 30 days from the receipt of the NSE determination. The request should include a description of the device, labeling for the device, reasons for the recommended classification and information to support the recommendation. The de novo process has a 60-day review period. If the FDA classifies the device into Class II, a company will then receive an approval order to market the device. This device type can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions. However, if the FDA subsequently determines that the device will remain in the Class III category, the device cannot be marketed until the manufacturer has obtained an approved PMA.
Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that would constitute a major change in its intended use, or any change that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, requires a new 510(k) clearance and may even, in some circumstances, require a PMA if the change raises complex or novel scientific issues or the product has a new intended use. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make the determination regarding the need for a new 510(k) submission in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer's decision. If the FDA were to disagree with a manufacturer's determination that changes did not require a new 510(k) submission, it could require the manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. If the FDA requires the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any modifications, the manufacturer may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device, if already in distribution, until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
Premarket Approval (PMA) Pathway for Medical Devices
While we believe that if any functionality in one or more of our current or future software products causes the software to be regulated as a medical device, our software products will be subject to the 510(k) clearance pathway, FDA could evaluate our product under the PMA pathway if it believes the device component raises sufficiently complex or novel scientific issues.
A PMA application must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process, or is not otherwise exempt from the FDA’s premarket clearance and approval requirements. A PMA application must generally be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel's recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturer or third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. Once a PMA is approved, the FDA may require that certain conditions of approval be met, such as conducting a post-market clinical trial.
New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA 
supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials generally require an application for an IDE, which is approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject.
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
After a product is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. In addition to the requirements below, adverse event reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Additional regulatory requirements include:
•product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
•QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, validation, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label use or indication;
•clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared or approved devices;
•notice or approval of product or manufacturing process modifications or deviations that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared or approved devices;
•post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply, when necessary, to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
•during a public health emergency, notification of permanent discontinuation of a device or a supply disruption due to an interruption in the manufacturing of a device, and the reasons for such discontinuance or supply disruption;
•regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
•notices of corrections or removals.
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. Furthermore, under the federal U.S. Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. In addition, manufacturers are required to meet regulatory requirements in countries outside the United States, which can change rapidly with relatively short notice. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved or uncleared use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or be subjected to regulatory or enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take enforcement actions against us if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in material fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
Failure by us or by our third-party manufacturers and suppliers to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to:
•untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil monetary penalties;
•customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusing to grant export approval for our products; or
•criminal prosecution.
Civil and Criminal Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect patients, governmental healthcare programs and private health plans from fraudulent and abusive activities. These laws include anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims. These laws are complex and broadly worded, and their application to our specific products, services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have over time increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules. These laws and regulations include:
Anti-Kickback Laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services regardless of whether the item or service is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan. Certain statutory and regulatory safe harbors exist that protect specified business arrangements from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all elements of an applicable safe harbor are met, however these safe harbors are narrow and often difficult to comply with. Congress has appropriated an increasing amount of funds in recent years to support enforcement activities aimed at reducing healthcare fraud and abuse.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, created certain safe harbor regulations which, if fully complied with, assure parties to a particular arrangement covered by a safe harbor that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. We attempt to structure our group purchasing services, pricing discount arrangements with suppliers, and revenue share arrangements with applicable members to meet the terms of the safe harbor for GPOs set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(j) and the discount safe harbor set forth at 42 C.F.R. § 1001.952(h). Although full compliance with the provisions of a safe harbor ensures against prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. From time to time, HHS, through its Office of Inspector General, makes formal and informal inquiries, conducts investigations and audits the business practices of GPOs, including our GPO, the result of which could be new rules, regulations or in some cases, a formal enforcement action. 
To help ensure regulatory compliance with HHS rules and regulations, our members that report their costs to Medicare are required under the terms of the Premier Group Purchasing Policy to appropriately reflect all elements of value received in connection with our IPO, including under the various agreements entered into in connection therewith, on their cost reports. We are required to furnish applicable reports to such members setting forth the amount of such value, to assist their compliance with such cost reporting requirements. There can be no assurance that the HHS Office of Inspector General or the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, will concur that these actions satisfy their applicable rules and regulations. 
False Claims Act. Our business is also subject to numerous federal and state laws that forbid the submission or “causing the submission” of false or fraudulent information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement to Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs or private health plans. In particular, the False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by an officer, employee or agent of the United States. In addition, the FCA prohibits a person from knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a claim. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, material monetary penalties, and other collateral consequences including, potentially, exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. A claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.
Privacy and Security Laws. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, contains substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as “protected health information.” The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity or a business associate (essentially, a third party engaged to assist a covered entity with enumerated operational and/or compliance functions) from using or disclosing protected health information unless the use or disclosure is validly authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the HIPAA Privacy Rule and only if certain complex requirements are met. In addition 
to following these complex requirements, covered entities and business associates must also meet additional compliance obligations set forth in the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes administrative, organizational, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by covered entities and business associates. The HIPAA Security Rule requirements are intended to mandate that covered entities and business associates regularly re-assess the adequacy of their safeguards in light of changing and evolving security risks. Finally, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires that covered entities and business associates, under certain circumstances, notify patients/beneficiaries, media outlets and HHS when there has been an improper use or disclosure of protected health information.
Our self-funded health benefit plan and our healthcare provider members (provided that these members engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions with health plans, which will be all or the vast majority) are directly regulated by HIPAA as “covered entities.” Additionally, because most of our U.S. hospital members disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain data analytics, benchmarking, consulting or other operational and compliance services to these members, we are a “business associate” of those members. In these cases, in order to provide members with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, HIPAA requires us to enter into “business associate agreements” with our covered entity members. Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:
(i)as to how we will use and disclose the protected health information within certain allowable parameters established by HIPAA,
(ii)that we will implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, organizational, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from impermissible use or disclosure,
(iii)that we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information,
(iv)that we will report breaches of unsecured protected health information, security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information, and
(v)that we will assist the covered entity with certain of its duties under HIPAA.
With the enactment of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH Act, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA were modified and expanded. The HITECH Act applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. Prior to this change, business associates had contractual obligations to covered entities but were not subject to direct enforcement by the federal government. In 2013, HHS released final rules implementing the HITECH Act changes to HIPAA. These amendments expanded the protection of protected health information by, among other things, imposing additional requirements on business associates, further restricting the disclosure of protected health information in certain cases when the disclosure is part of a remunerated transaction, and modifying the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, which has been in effect since September 2009, to create a rebuttable presumption that an improper use or disclosure of protected health information under certain circumstances requires notice to affected patients/beneficiaries, media outlets and HHS.
Transaction Requirements. HIPAA also mandates format, data content and provider identifier standards that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. Although our systems are fully capable of transmitting transactions that comply with these requirements, some payors and healthcare clearinghouses with which we conduct business may interpret HIPAA transaction requirements differently than we do or may require us to use legacy formats or include legacy identifiers as they make the transition to full compliance. In cases where payors or healthcare clearinghouses require conformity with their interpretations or require us to accommodate legacy transactions or identifiers as a condition of successful transactions, we attempt to comply with their requirements, but may be subject to enforcement actions as a result. In 2009, CMS published a final rule adopting updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets and changing the formats to be used for electronic transactions subject to the ICD-10 code sets, known as Version 5010. All healthcare providers are required to comply with Version 5010 and use the ICD-10 code sets.
Other Federal and State Laws. In addition to our obligations under HIPAA there are other federal laws that impose specific privacy and security obligations, above and beyond HIPAA, for certain types of health information and impose additional sanctions and penalties. These rules are not preempted by HIPAA. Most states have enacted patient and/or beneficiary confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, data security breach notification requirements, and special rules for so-called “sensitive” health information, such as mental health, genetic testing results, or Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, status. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them as well.
We are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. 
Antitrust Laws
The Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws are complex laws that prohibit contracts in restraint of trade or other activities that are designed to or that have the effect of reducing competition in the market. The federal antitrust laws promote fair competition in business and are intended to create a level playing field so that both small and large companies are able to compete in the market. In their 1996 Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care, or the Healthcare Statements, the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, set forth guidelines specifically designed to help GPOs gauge whether a particular purchasing arrangement may raise antitrust concerns and established an antitrust safety zone for joint purchasing arrangements among healthcare providers. Under this antitrust safety zone, the DOJ and FTC will not challenge, except in extraordinary circumstances, joint purchasing arrangements among healthcare providers that meet two basic conditions: (i) the purchases made by the healthcare providers account for less than 35% of the total sales of the purchased product or service in the relevant market; and (ii) the cost of the products and services purchased jointly account for less than 20% of the total revenues from all products and services sold by each competing participant in the joint purchasing arrangement.
We have attempted to structure our contracts and pricing arrangements in accordance with the Healthcare Statements and believe that our GPO supplier contracts and pricing discount arrangements should not be found to violate the antitrust laws. No assurance can be given that enforcement authorities will agree with this assessment. In addition, private parties also may bring suit for alleged violations under the U.S. antitrust laws. From time to time, the group purchasing industry comes under review by Congress and other governmental bodies with respect to antitrust laws, the scope of which includes, among other things, the relationships between GPOs and their members, distributors, manufacturers and other suppliers, as well as the services performed and payments received in connection with GPO programs.
Congress, the DOJ, the FTC, the U.S. Senate or another state or federal entity could at any time open a new investigation of the group purchasing industry, or develop new rules, regulations or laws governing the industry, that could adversely impact our ability to negotiate pricing arrangements with suppliers, increase reporting and documentation requirements, or otherwise require us to modify our arrangements in a manner that adversely impacts our business. We may also face private or government lawsuits alleging violations arising from the concerns articulated by these governmental factors or alleging violations based solely on concerns of individual private parties.
Health IT Certification Program
In 2009, Congress included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act a program to incentivize the adoption of health information technology by hospitals and ambulatory providers who participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Congress further modified the incentive program for ambulatory providers under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”). Any developer of health information technology seeking to offer a product to assist hospitals or ambulatory health care providers to meet the requirements of these programs must obtain certification under the applicable certification criteria established by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”). There are two types of certification for health information developers seeking to participate in the certification program: 1) certification to all the certification criteria required to meet the definition of a “2015 Edition Base EHR”; or 2) certification as a Health IT Module, meeting specific certification criteria. Meeting the certification criteria as a “2015 Edition Base EHR” allows a developer of health information technology to offer a product that has all the capabilities needed for a hospital or an ambulatory provider to meet the requirements of the health IT incentive programs. A Health IT Module provides a specific set of capabilities. Hospitals or ambulatory providers seeking to avoid potential payment reductions must either implement a 2015 Base EHR using a single product, or multiple Health IT Modules that together have all of the capabilities of a 2015 Base EHR.
We currently have two products that are certified as Health IT Modules. To retain our certification, we must: 1) meet applicable conditions of certification and maintenance of certification requirements established by ONC; 2) pass testing conducted by an ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratory pursuant to test procedures developed by ONC; and 3) obtain certification from an ONC-Authorized Certification Body. ONC’s conditions of certification and maintenance of certification requirements include communication restrictions that largely prevent us from limiting our customer's ability to communicate about the usability, interoperability, security or user experiences relating to our Health IT Modules. These regulations require us to review and modify current contract terms or inform customers that offending contract terms we previously entered into are no longer effective. We are also required to develop and execute a real-world testing plan, which would require us to demonstrate to our ONC-Authorized Certification Body that our Health IT Modules operate as designed when implemented in the field. Failure to properly implement these requirements could result in our two products losing their status as Health IT Modules, which could jeopardize the utility of the products for our customers. We work closely with our selected ONC-Authorized Testing Laboratory 
and ONC-Authorized Certification Body to meet these and other requirements of Health IT Certification Program. We are unable to predict what changes to the certification program might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. 
ERISA and Laws Impacting Employer Group Health Plans
Many of the clients we serve sponsor employer group health plans, which are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the Internal Revenue Code, Medicare Secondary Payer statute, HIPAA privacy, and in some cases, state insurance laws. While compliance for these various rules falls on the employer-sponsor of the health plan, in some cases, compliance is delegated to a vendor, such as us. We protect ourselves from liability for these client health plans by virtue of contractual provisions insulating us from exposure and responsibility for the employer-sponsor's legal obligations. 
Governmental Audits
Because we act as a GPO for healthcare providers that participate in governmental programs, our group purchasing services have in the past and may again in the future be subject to periodic surveys and audits by governmental entities or contractors for compliance with Medicare and Medicaid standards and requirements. We will continue to respond to these government reviews and audits but cannot predict what the outcome of any future audits may be or whether the results of any audits could materially or negatively impact our business, our financial condition or results of operations.
Corporate Compliance Department
We execute and maintain a compliance and ethics program that is designed to assist us and our employees in conducting operations and activities ethically with the highest level of integrity and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, if violations occur, to promote early detection and prompt resolution. These objectives are achieved through education, monitoring, disciplinary action and other remedial measures we believe to be appropriate. We provide all of our employees with education that has been developed to communicate our standards of conduct, compliance policies and procedures as well as policies for monitoring, reporting and responding to compliance issues. We also provide all of our employees with a third-party toll-free number and Internet website address in order to report any compliance or privacy concerns. In addition, our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer individually, and along with the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, helps oversee compliance and ethics matters across our business operations. 
Human Capital Management
