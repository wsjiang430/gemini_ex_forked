Business Segments
Our business is composed of one segment, petroleum additives, which is primarily represented by Afton. The antiknock compounds business of Ethyl is reflected in the “All other” category. Each of these is discussed below.
Petroleum Additives—Petroleum additives are used in lubricating oils and fuels to enhance their performance in machinery, vehicles, and other equipment. We manufacture chemical components that are selected to perform one or more specific functions and combine those chemicals with other chemicals or components to form additive packages for use in specified end-user applications. The petroleum additives market is a global marketplace, with customers ranging from large, integrated oil companies to national, regional, and independent companies. 
We believe our success in the petroleum additives market is largely due to our ability to deliver value to our customers through our products and our open, flexible, and collaborative working style. We accomplish this by understanding what our customers value and by applying our technical capabilities, formulation expertise, broadly differentiated product solutions, and global supply capabilities to satisfy the customers' needs. We invest significantly in research and development in order to meet our customers’ needs and to adapt to the rapidly changing environment for new and improved products and services.
We view the petroleum additives marketplace as being comprised of two broad product applications: lubricant additives and fuel additives. Lubricant additives are highly formulated chemical solutions that, when blended with base fluids, improve the efficiency, durability, performance, and functionality of mineral oils, synthetic oils, and biodegradable fluids, thereby enhancing the performance of machinery and engines. Fuel additives are chemical components that help oil refiners meet fuel specifications or formulated packages that improve the performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels, resulting in lower operating costs, improved vehicle performance, and reduced emissions.
Lubricant Additives
Lubricant additives are essential ingredients for making lubricating oils. Lubricant additives are used in a wide variety of vehicle and industrial applications, including engine oils, transmission fluids, off-road powertrain and hydraulic systems, gear oils, hydraulic oils, turbine oils, metalworking fluids and virtually any other application where metal-to-metal moving parts are utilized. Lubricant additives are organic and synthetic chemical components that enhance wear protection, prevent deposits, and protect against the hostile operating environment of an engine, transmission, axle, hydraulic pump, or industrial machine.
Lubricants are widely used in operating machinery from transportation vehicles to heavy industrial equipment. Lubricants provide a layer of protection between moving mechanical parts. Without this layer of protection, the normal functioning of machinery would not occur. Effective lubricants reduce downtime and increase efficiency. Specifically, lubricants serve the following main functions:

• | friction reduction—Friction is reduced by maintaining a thin film of lubricant between moving surfaces, preventing them from coming into direct contact with one another and reducing wear on moving machinery, thereby providing longer life and operational efficiency.


• | heat removal—Lubricants act as coolants by removing heat resulting either from friction or through contact with other, higher temperature materials.


• | containment of contaminants—Lubricants function by carrying contaminants away from the machinery and neutralizing the harmful impact of the by-products created by combustion.

The functionality of lubricants is created through an exact balance between a base fluid and performance enhancing additives. This balance is the goal of effective formulations achieved by experienced research and development professionals. We offer a full line of lubricant additive packages, each of which is composed of component chemicals specially selected to perform desired functions. We manufacture most of the chemical components and blend these components to create formulated additives packages designed to meet industry and customer specifications. Lubricant additive components are generally classified based upon their intended functionality, including:

• | detergents, which clean moving parts of engines and machines, suspend oil contaminants and combustion by-products, and absorb acidic combustion products;

4


• | dispersants, which serve to inhibit the formation of sludge and particulates;


• | extreme pressure/antiwear agents, which reduce wear on moving engine and machinery parts;


• | viscosity index modifiers, which improve the viscosity and temperature characteristics of lubricants and help the lubricant flow evenly to all parts of an engine or machine; and


• | antioxidants, which prevent oil from degrading over time.

We are one of the leading global suppliers of specially formulated lubricant additives that combine some or all of the components described above to develop our products. Our products are highly formulated, complex chemical compositions derived from extensive research and testing to ensure all additive components work together to provide the intended results. Our products are engineered to meet specifications prescribed by either the industry or a specific customer. Purchasers of lubricant additives tend to be integrated oil companies or independent compounders/blenders. We make no sales directly to end-users or to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).
We view our participation in the lubricant marketplace in three primary areas: engine oil additives, driveline additives, and industrial additives. Our view is not necessarily the same way others view the market.
Engine Oil Additives—The largest submarket within the lubricant additives marketplace is engine oil additives which consists of additives designed for passenger cars, motorcycles, on and off-road heavy duty commercial equipment, locomotives, and large engines in ocean-going vessels. We estimate engine oil additives represent approximately 70% of the overall lubricant additives market volume. 
The engine oil market’s primary customers include consumers, fleet owners, mining and construction companies, farmers, railroads, shipping companies, service dealers, and OEMs. The primary functions of engine oil additives are to reduce friction, prevent wear, control formation of sludge and oxidation, and prevent rust. Engine oil additives are typically sold to lubricant manufacturers who combine them with a base oil fluid to meet internal, industry, and OEM specifications.
Key drivers of engine oil additives demand are the number of vehicles on the road, total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, the average age of vehicles on the road, drain intervals, engine and crankcase size, changes in engine design, and temperature and specification changes driven by the OEMs. The extension of drain intervals has generally offset increased demand due to higher vehicle population, new hardware, and more miles driven. Other key drivers include industrial production rates, agricultural output, mining and construction output, environmental regulations, and infrastructure investments of commercial companies. Afton offers products that enhance the performance of mineral, part-synthetic, and fully-synthetic engine oils.
Driveline Additives—The driveline additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products such as transmission fluids, axle fluids, and off-road powertrain fluids. This submarket shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. Transmission fluids primarily serve as the power transmission and heat transfer medium in the area of the transmission where the torque of the drive shaft is transferred to the gears of the vehicle. Axle fluids lubricate gears and bearings in axles, and powertrain fluids are used in off-highway powertrain and hydraulic systems. Other products in this area include power steering fluids, shock absorber fluids, gear oils, and lubricants for heavy machinery. These products must conform to highly prescribed specifications developed by vehicle OEMs for specific models or designs. These additives are generally sold to oil companies for ultimate sale to vehicle OEMs for new vehicles (factory-fill), service dealers for aftermarket servicing (service-fill), retailers, and distributors.
Key drivers of the driveline additives marketplace are the number of vehicles manufactured, total number of vehicles in operation, drain intervals for transmission fluids and axle fluids, changes in engine and transmission design and temperatures, and specification changes driven by the OEMs.
Industrial Additives—The industrial additives submarket is comprised of additives designed for products for industrial applications such as hydraulic fluids, grease, industrial gear fluids, industrial specialty applications, such as turbine oils, and metalworking fluids. This submarket also shares in the 30% of the market not covered by engine oil additives. These products must conform to industry specifications, OEM requirements, and/or application and operating environment demands. Industrial additives are generally sold to oil companies, service dealers for after-market servicing, and distributors.
5

Key drivers of the industrial additives marketplace are gross domestic product levels and industrial production.
Fuel Additives
Fuel additives are chemical compounds that are used to improve both the oil refining process and the performance of gasoline, diesel, biofuels, and other fuels. Benefits of fuel additives in the oil refining process include reduced use of crude oil, lower processing costs, and improved fuel storage properties. Fuel performance additives enhance fuel economy, improve ignition and combustion efficiency, reduce emission particulates, maintain engine cleanliness, and protect against deposits in fuel injectors, intake valves, and the combustion chamber. Our fuel additives are extensively tested and designed to meet stringent industry, government, OEM, and individual customer requirements.
Many different types of additives are used in fuels. Their use is generally determined by customer, industry, OEM, and government specifications, and often differs from country to country. The types of fuel additives we offer include:

• | gasoline performance additives, which clean and maintain key elements of the fuel delivery systems, including fuel injectors and intake valves, in gasoline engines;


• | diesel fuel performance additives, which perform similar cleaning functions in diesel engines;


• | cetane improvers, which increase the cetane number (ignition quality) in diesel fuel by reducing the delay between injection and ignition;


• | stabilizers, which reduce or eliminate oxidation in fuel;


• | corrosion inhibitors, which minimize the corrosive effects of combustion by-products and prevent rust;


• | lubricity additives, which restore lubricating properties lost in the refining process;


• | cold flow improvers, which improve the pumping and flow of distillate and diesel fuels in cold temperatures; and


• | octane enhancers, which increase octane ratings and decrease emissions.

We offer a broad line of fuel additives worldwide and sell our products to major fuel marketers and refiners, as well as independent terminals and other fuel blenders.
Key drivers in the fuel additive marketplace include total vehicle miles driven, fuel economy, the introduction of new engine designs, regulations on emissions (both gasoline and diesel), quality of the crude oil slate and performance standards, and marketing programs of major oil companies.
Competition
We believe we are one of the four largest manufacturers and suppliers in the petroleum additives marketplace.
In the lubricant additives submarket of petroleum additives, our major competitors are The Lubrizol Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.), Infineum (a joint venture between ExxonMobil Chemical and Royal Dutch Shell plc), and Chevron Oronite Company LLC. There are several other suppliers in the worldwide market who are competitors in their particular product areas.
The fuel additives submarket is characterized by more competitors. While we participate in many facets of the fuel additives market, our competitors tend to be more narrowly focused. In the gasoline detergent market, we compete mainly against BASF, Chevron Oronite Company LLC, and The Lubrizol Corporation. In the diesel and refinery markets, we compete mainly against The Lubrizol Corporation, Infineum, BASF, Clariant Ltd., and Innospec Inc. We also compete against other regional competitors in the fuel additives marketplace.
The competition among the participants in these industries is characterized by the need to provide customers with cost effective, technologically-capable products that meet or exceed industry specifications. The need to continually increase technology performance and lower cost through formulation technology and cost improvement programs is vital for success in this environment.

All Other—The “All other” category includes the operations of the antiknock compounds business (primarily sales of antiknock compounds in North America), as well as certain contracted manufacturing and services performed by Ethyl. The Ethyl facility is located in Houston, Texas and is substantially dedicated to terminal operations related to antiknock compounds and other fuel additives. The financial results of the petroleum additives activities by Ethyl are reflected in the petroleum additives segment results. The “All other” category financial results include a service fee charged by Ethyl for its production services to Afton. 
Raw Materials and Product Supply
We use a variety of raw materials and chemicals in our manufacturing and blending processes and believe the sources of these are adequate for our current operations. The primary raw materials for Afton are base oil, polyisobutylene, antioxidants, alcohols, solvents, sulfonates, friction modifiers, olefins, and copolymers.
As the performance requirements of our products become more complex, we often work with highly specialized suppliers. In some cases, we source from a single supplier. In cases where we decide to source from a single supplier, we manage our risk by maintaining safety stock of the raw material or qualifying alternate suppliers. The backup position could take additional time to implement, but we are confident we can ensure continued supply for our customers. We continue to monitor the raw material supply situation and continually adjust our procurement strategies as conditions require.
Research, Development, and Testing
Research, development, and testing (R&D) provides Afton with new performance-based solutions for our customers in the petroleum additives market. We develop products through a combination of chemical synthesis, formulation development, engineering design, and performance testing. In addition to developing new products, R&D provides our customers and OEMs with data to substantiate product differentiation and technical support to assure total customer satisfaction.
We are committed to providing the most advanced products, comprehensive testing programs, and superior technical solutions tailored to the needs of our customers and OEMs worldwide. Afton continues to successfully implement techniques to drive efficiency in technology discovery and development, while expanding our internal testing, research, and customer support capabilities around the world in support of our goals of providing market-driven technical leadership and performance-based differentiation.  In 2018, we commenced construction to expand our laboratories in Tsukuba, Japan, which will enhance our technical infrastructure and testing capability in the region.
Afton continues to develop new products and technology to meet evolving OEM requirements (including specific demands of hybrid and electric vehicles), industry specifications and environmental regulations, and to keep our customers well-positioned for the future.  A significant portion of our R&D investment is dedicated to the development of products that are differentiated by their ability to deliver improved fuel efficiency in addition to robust performance in a wide range of new vehicle and industrial equipment designs.  Afton’s state-of-the art testing capabilities enable customized research in all areas of performance needed by both OEMs and tier one suppliers. Our leading-edge capabilities and fundamental understanding in the areas of combustion, friction control, energy efficiency, and wear prevention are used to set the stage for next-generation products in all areas.
In 2018, we successfully launched new technologies across all of our lubricant additive and fuel additive product areas. We developed new engine oil products for passenger cars and commercial trucks in support of our customers in all the major regions of the world in which we operate. Research in the engine oil area remains high as we continue to prepare for the new engine oil specification in North America for passenger car motor oil, ILSAC GF-6.  This new specification is expected to go into effect in 2020. 
We continued to develop new products in multiple application areas in the industrial additive sector, including hydraulic, industrial gear, turbine, slideway, and grease additives. Research is focused on the development of technologies that will provide differentiation to our customers in multiple performance areas including equipment life, reliability, and energy efficiency.

Research continued in our transmission fluid, axle oil, and tractor fluid product lines. This included the development of new OEM-specific additives used in factory fill fluids installed during automotive component and vehicle assembly in the United States, Germany, Japan, India, and China. In addition, we developed new products for the service-fill sector to provide our customers with the latest additive technology available including some first to market capability enabling our customers to differentiate their offering to the retail market.
We continue to provide leading technology in the fuel additives area. In 2018, we developed and launched new products in all product lines including gasoline performance additives and diesel performance additives, as well as additives used in the distribution of fuels. Research is focused on the development of new technologies that perform well in new, modern engine designs and changing fuel properties, as well as addressing the growing need for increased fuel economy and emissions reduction. In addition, we continue to maintain close interactions with regulatory, industry, and OEM leaders to guide our development of future fuel additive technologies based on well-defined market needs.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property, including our patents, licenses, and trademarks, is an important component of our business. We actively protect our inventions, new technologies, and product developments by filing patent applications and maintaining trade secrets. We currently own approximately 1,400 issued or pending United States and foreign patents. In addition, we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise. We take care to respect the intellectual property rights of others and we believe our products do not infringe upon those rights. We vigorously participate in patent opposition proceedings around the world, where necessary, to secure a technology base free of infringement. We believe our patent position is strong, aggressively managed, and sufficient for the conduct of our business.
We also have several hundred trademark registrations throughout the world for our marks, including NewMarket®, Afton Chemical®, Ethyl®, mmt®, HiTEC®, GREENBURN®, Passion for Solutions®, CleanStart®, Microbotz®, DriveMore® and Axcel®.
Commitment to Environmental and Safety Excellence
Our commitment to the environment and safety excellence applies to every employee, contractor, and visitor every day, at every site. Safety and environmental responsibility are a way of life at NewMarket - enhancing operations, the way we work, and the relationships we maintain with our employees, customers, supply chain partners, and the communities in which we operate. Our objective is to establish a culture where our employees understand that good environmental and safety performance is good business and understand that environmental compliance and safety are their personal responsibilities. Every employee at NewMarket is responsible for ensuring that our high standards in the area of health, safety (including process safety), environmental protection, and security are upheld at all times.
Our Global Responsible Care Policy Statement includes a commitment to conduct operations in a manner that protects our employees, communities, and the environment, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and to reduce our environmental impacts. Additionally, in pursuit of our vision of zero incidents, we work with our employees and other key stakeholders to establish appropriate goals, objectives and targets. 
Both Afton and Ethyl have implemented Responsible Care® Management Systems (RC14001®) at U.S. facilities. Our Responsible Care® management systems are certified by an independent third-party auditing process. Additionally, Afton’s Feluy, Belgium; Suzhou, China; Hyderabad, India; Tsukuba, Japan; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Bracknell, England; and Singapore facilities are all certified to the environmental standard ISO 14001. Suzhou is also certified to OHSAS 18001, a global occupational health and safety standard. Afton’s Sauget, Illinois plant continues to be an OSHA VPP (Voluntary Protection Program) “Star” worksite.

In 2018, we continued to enhance our “Actively Caring” safety program, where people look out for the safety and welfare of others with courage and compassion, enabling the achievement of an injury-free environment. Our worldwide injury/illness recordable rate (which is the number of injuries per 200,000 hours worked) in 2018 was 1.05. Our performance was impacted by the integration of our acquisition in San Juan del Rio, Mexico, as well as an overall increase in injuries at our other sites. Minor injuries across the sites highlights the importance of our safety-first culture and have renewed our focus. We introduced new metrics and emphasized reporting of "good catches" and "near misses" to help reduce risk and drive improved performance. We are committed to achieving our aspiration of zero injuries and incidents. To that end, several of our sites did achieve the "Vision of Zero" with no injuries in 2018.
As members of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), Afton and Ethyl provide data on twelve metrics used to track environmental impact, safety, energy use, community outreach and emergency preparedness, greenhouse gas intensity, and product stewardship performance of the ACC member companies. These can be viewed at http://responsiblecare.americanchemistry.com/Performance-Results. The information on this website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Environmental
We believe that we comply, in all material respects, with laws, regulations, statutes, and ordinances protecting the environment, including those related to the management and stewardship of chemicals. We have policies and procedures in place establishing regular reviews of our compliance and stewardship, as well as monitoring any significant existing, potential or threatened environmental issues that could materially affect the company.
Our total accruals for environmental remediation, dismantling, and decontamination were approximately $12 million at December 31, 2018 and $14 million December 31, 2017. 
As new technology becomes available, it may be possible to reduce accrued amounts. While we believe that we are currently fully accrued for known environmental issues, it is possible that unexpected future costs could have a significant financial impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
We spent approximately $30 million in 2018, $26 million in 2017, and $24 million in 2016 for ongoing environmental operating and clean-up costs, excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures. These environmental operating and clean-up expenses are primarily included in cost of goods sold.
For capital expenditures on pollution prevention and safety projects, we spent $10 million in 2018, $10 million in 2017, and $14 million in 2016. We expect expenditures in 2019 to be at a level similar to the previous three years.
The costs of complying with governmental pollution prevention and safety regulations are subject to:

• | potential changes in applicable statutes and regulations (or their enforcement and interpretation);


• | uncertainty as to the success of anticipated solutions to pollution problems;


• | uncertainty as to whether additional expense may prove necessary; and


• | potential for emerging technology to affect remediation methods and reduce associated costs.

We are subject to liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damage, or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances. Further, we may have environmental liabilities imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations. These liabilities may also be imposed jointly and severally (so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved, or even the entire loss) and may be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue, including, for example, entities that formerly owned or operated the property and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at an affected property. We are subject to many environmental laws, including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the United States, and similar foreign and state laws.
9

Under CERCLA, we are currently considered a potentially responsible party (PRP), at a few sites, ranging from smaller than a de minimis PRP to involvement considered more of a minor PRP. At some of these sites, the remediation methodology, as well as the proportionate shares of each PRP, has been well established. Other sites are not as mature, which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of the future clean-up or remediation costs.
In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named us as a PRP under Superfund law for the clean-up of soil and groundwater contamination at the five grouped disposal sites known as "Sauget Area 2 Sites" in Sauget, Illinois. Without admitting any fact, responsibility, fault, or liability in connection with this site, in November 2018, we resolved our purported liabilities with the government and those PRP's performing the remedial activities addressed in the EPA's December 2013 Record of Decision. See Note 17 for further information.
