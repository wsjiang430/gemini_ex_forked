ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
Overview
Veeva is the leading provider of industry cloud solutions for the global life sciences industry. Our offerings span cloud software, data, and business consulting and are designed to meet the unique needs of our customers and their most strategic business functions—from research and development (R&D) to commercialization. Our solutions help life sciences companies develop and bring products to market faster and more efficiently, market and sell more effectively, and maintain compliance with government regulations.
Customer success is one of our core values, and our focus on it has allowed us to deepen and expand our strategic relationships with customers over time. Because of our industry focus, we have a unique, in-depth perspective into the needs and best practices of life sciences companies and clinical research sites. This allows us to develop targeted solutions, quickly adapt to regulatory changes, and incorporate highly relevant enhancements into our existing solutions at a rapid pace.
Our goal is to become the most strategic technology partner to the life sciences industry and achieve long-term leadership with our solutions that support the R&D and commercial functions of life sciences companies. Our commercial solutions help life sciences companies achieve better, more intelligent engagement with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations across multiple communication channels, and plan and execute more effective media and marketing campaigns. Our R&D solutions for the clinical, regulatory, quality, and safety functions help life sciences companies streamline their end-to-end product development processes to increase operational efficiency and maintain regulatory compliance throughout the product life cycle. Our solutions for clinical research sites enable regulatory documents and trial information to be managed in a modern cloud solution that is intended to accelerate the clinical research process for the life sciences industry overall.
We also bring the benefits of our content and data management solutions to customers in the consumer products and chemical industries. Our applications currently offered to companies in these industries are designed to help customers efficiently manage critical processes and content in a compliant way, and to enable secure collaboration across internal and external stakeholders, including outsourcing partners and vendors.
On February 1, 2021, after approval by our stockholders, we became a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC). A PBC is a for-profit company operating under subchapter XV of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (i) that has adopted a public benefit purpose intended to provide benefits beyond just stockholder financial returns, and (ii) whose directors have a fiduciary duty to balance the financial interests of stockholders, the best interests of other stakeholders materially affected by the company's conduct (which we believe includes customers, employees, partners, and the communities in which we operate), and the pursuit of the company's public benefit purpose. Our public benefit purpose, as reflected in our certificate of incorporation, is “to provide products and services that are intended to help make the industries we serve more productive, and to create high-quality employment opportunities in the communities in which we operate.” We believe that operating as a PBC reflects our core values—do the right thing, customer success, employee success, and speed—and helps us maintain alignment with the principal industry we serve, life sciences, and its broad goal to improve health and extend lives.

Our life sciences customers range from the largest global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., and Novartis Pharma AG, to emerging growth pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alkermes Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd, and Moderna Therapeutics Inc. We also deliver solutions to companies in the CP&C industries. 
Our Human Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2023, we had 6,744 employees worldwide, up by 1,262 from the previous year. Our employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign locations, local workers’ councils represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
Our workforce is diverse in many respects. As of January 31, 2023, 44% of our global employee population self-identified as female and approximately 39% of our U.S. workforce self-identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups. We define underrepresented racial or ethnic groups as those comprising individuals who identify as American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, or two or more races.
We use a combination of base salary and equity to compensate our employees. We also offer a range of benefits to our employees, including comprehensive healthcare and other wellness programs. We believe our compensation and benefits programs are competitive. 
While we experience intense competition for talent, we believe we have been effective at attracting and retaining talented employees.
Research and Development
Our R&D organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our solutions and applications. Based on customer feedback and needs, we focus our efforts on developing new solutions functionality, applications, and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing solutions and applications.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. In large life sciences companies, the R&D and commercial business functions commonly have separate technology and business decision makers. Accordingly, we market and sell our solutions to align with the distinct characteristics of those decision makers. We have distinct R&D and commercial sales teams, which we further segment to focus on selling to large global life sciences companies and smaller life sciences companies. We also have a distinct sales team for our sales efforts to companies in the CP&C industries.
Technology Infrastructure and Operations
Our products are hosted in data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Our products used only within China are hosted in data centers located in China. We utilize third parties to provide our computing infrastructure and manage the infrastructure on which our solutions operate. For example, for Veeva CRM and certain of our multichannel CRM applications, we currently utilize the hosting infrastructure provided by Salesforce, Inc. For our Veeva Vault applications and certain other Veeva Commercial Cloud applications, we utilize Amazon Web Services.
Our infrastructure providers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage, biometric readers at entry points and anonymous exteriors. We also implement various disaster recovery measures such that data loss would be minimized in the event of a single data center disaster. We architect our solutions using redundant configurations to minimize service interruptions. We continually monitor our solutions for any sign of failure or pending failure, and we take preemptive action to attempt to minimize or prevent downtime.
Our technology is based on multitenant architectures that apply common, consistent management practices for all customers using our solutions. We enable multiple customers to share the same version of our solutions while 

Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K

securely partitioning their respective data. Portions of our multichannel customer relationship management applications currently utilize the Salesforce platform of Salesforce, Inc. Our Veeva Vault applications and portions of our other Commercial Cloud applications are built upon our own proprietary platforms. We recently announced that we intend to migrate our applications built on the Salesforce platform to our own Veeva Vault platform. Certain of our other applications rely on technology platforms provided by Amazon Web Services. For example, our commercial data warehouse application utilizes Amazon Redshift and our digital engagement application utilizes Zoom.
Quality and Compliance Program
Veeva maintains a quality management system certified to ISO9001 to ensure process controls conform to established industry standards for our cloud software offerings that are subject to good practice regulations for the life sciences industry. Robust audit trail tracking, compliant electronic signature capture, data encryption, and secure access controls are required for these software offerings, and they must be thoroughly tested for compliance with applicable life sciences industry regulations, which include:

Security Program
Veeva maintains an information security management system certified to ISO 27001 and managed by our Veeva security team to ensure security controls conform to established standards across both product and infrastructure components. Our solution undergoes internal vulnerability testing prior to release, and we employ third parties to perform penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions on at least an annual basis. We also obtain independent third-party audit opinions related to security and availability annually, such as SOC 2 Type 2 reports and ISO 27001 attestation reports. We also require role-based security and security awareness training and have defined security incident response processes.
Privacy Program
Veeva maintains a global privacy program aligned to applicable laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We have a Chief Privacy Officer, who collaborates with our Chief Information Security Officer and business and product leaders throughout our organization. Veeva maintains an active EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification and a Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification; however, we currently rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses as our alternative legal data transfer mechanism. Veeva is also registered as a data broker as required by the California Attorney General. In addition, Veeva maintains privacy policies and procedures and role-based privacy awareness training. For more information about our privacy practices, please visit veeva.com/privacy.
Competition
The markets for our solutions are global, rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing regulations, advancing technology, and shifting customer needs. In new sales cycles, we generally compete with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications geared toward the life sciences industry. The principal such competitor for our Veeva Commercial Cloud applications is IQVIA Holdings Inc., which offers a CRM application built on the Salesforce platform, various data products, and other applications that compete with our products. Our 

Veeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K

data and data analytics products, including Veeva OpenData, Veeva Link, Veeva Crossix, and Veeva Compass, compete with IQVIA, Ipsos Group S.A., Definitive Health Corp., and smaller data and data analytics providers. No single vendor offers products that compete with all of our Veeva Vault applications, but IQVIA, Dassault Systèmes, OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Honeywell International Inc., and other smaller application providers offer applications that compete with certain of our Veeva Vault applications.
Our Commercial Cloud and Development Cloud application suites also compete to replace client server-based legacy solutions offered by companies such as Oracle, Microsoft Corporation, and other smaller application providers. Our customers may also choose to use cloud-based applications or platforms that are not life sciences specific—such as Salesforce, Inc., Box, Inc., Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft—for certain of the functions our applications provide.
We sell certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies outside the life sciences industry. In this segment of our business, we compete with solutions such as those offered by OpenText, Microsoft, Honeywell, EtQ Management Consultants, LLC, Oracle, and Box, and custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or in-house by our potential customers.
Our business consulting and professional services offerings compete with a range of professional services firms.
Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, and agreements with a broader set of system integrators and other partners. We expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•level of customer satisfaction;
•regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
•domain expertise with respect to life sciences;
•ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;
•breadth and depth of solution and application functionality;
•brand awareness and reputation;
•modern and adaptive technology platform;
•capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;
•total cost of ownership;
•ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•ability to secure the rights to load and process third party proprietary data licensed by customers; and
•ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors.

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have developed a process for seeking patent protection for our technology innovations. The table below provides a summary of our issued patents and pending patent applications as of January 31, 2023:

Issued U.S. patents (expiring between May 2027 and January 2039) | 59
Issued international patents (expiring between April 2025 and June 2037) | 13
U.S. and international pending patent applications | 65

Our patents and patent applications cover technology within our Veeva Development Cloud and Veeva Commercial Cloud product families. We plan to continue expanding our patent portfolio. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Although we rely on our intellectual property rights, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position as a provider of technology solutions to the life sciences industry.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming.
Companies in our industry, as well as non-practicing entities, often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with competitors in which the competitors are asserting trade secret misappropriation and other claims, and we may face new allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights of other competitors or non-practicing entities. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims by competitors as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps, and by non-practicing entities. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. For example, see the description of our current litigations in note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
