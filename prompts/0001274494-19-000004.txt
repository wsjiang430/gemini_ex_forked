Item 1. Business
Company Overview
We are a leading global provider of comprehensive PV solar energy solutions. We design, manufacture, and sell PV solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop, design, construct, and sell PV solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture. Additionally, we provide operations and maintenance (“O&M”) services to system owners. We have substantial, ongoing R&D efforts focused on module and system-level innovations. We are the world’s largest thin film PV solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest PV solar module manufacturers.
In addressing the overall global demand for electricity, our high-efficiency CdTe modules, led by our Series 6 module technology, and fully integrated systems provide competitively priced utility-scale PV solar energy solutions, which compete on an economic basis in many climates with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to end-users. Our vertically-integrated capabilities enable us to provide such solutions, accelerate the adoption of our technology, and successfully sell into key markets around the world. We seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain, resulting in more reliable and cost effective energy solutions for our customers.
Business Strategy
We believe the following strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our leading industry position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of PV solar energy solutions.
Differentiated Technology
As a field-proven technology, our CdTe solar modules offer certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon based solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency, higher real-world energy yield, and long-term reliability. Proven to deliver up to 8% more usable energy per nameplate watt than conventional technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance, our CdTe technology delivers more energy, more consistently, over the lifetime of a PV solar power system. Our Series 6 module technology, with its combination of high wattage, low manufacturing costs, a larger form factor, and balance of systems (“BoS”) component compatibility, has further enhanced our competitive position since the launch of such technology in 2018. We expect our continued transition to Series 6 module technology to enable us to maximize the intrinsic cost advantage of CdTe thin film technology versus crystalline silicon.
In terms of energy yield, in many climates our CdTe solar modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating. For example, our CdTe solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient, which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation, on average, occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°C (standard test conditions). In addition, our CdTe solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards. Our CdTe solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules, which may lose up to three times as much power as CdTe solar modules when shading occurs. As a result of these factors, our PV solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional systems with the same nameplate capacity.
Manufacturing Process
Our modules are manufactured in a high-throughput, automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line. Such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time-consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. At the outset of 
 3

the production of our modules, a sheet of glass enters the production line and in less than 3.5 hours is transformed into a completed module, which is flash tested, packaged, and ready for shipment. With more than 20 GWDC of modules sold worldwide, we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation. We have a global manufacturing footprint with facilities based in Perrysburg, Ohio; Kulim, Malaysia; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
As we continue to transition our manufacturing capacity to Series 6 module technology, we expect to ramp down substantially all production of our Series 4TM (“Series 4”) modules in 2019. Although this transition process has resulted in a temporary reduction in production capacity, the process has allowed us to use our existing manufacturing infrastructure to more quickly and cost effectively deploy our Series 6 module technology to best position us for long-term competitiveness and growth.
Vertical Integration
We are vertically integrated across substantially the entire solar value chain. Many of the efficiencies, cost reductions, and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not vertically integrated in a similar manner. Accordingly, our operational model offers PV solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities, including advanced PV solar module manufacturing, project development, engineering and plant optimization, grid integration and plant control systems, procurement and construction services, and O&M services.
Financial Viability
We are committed to creating long-term shareholder value through a decision-making framework that delivers a balance of growth, profitability, and liquidity. This framework has enabled us to fund our Series 6 transition and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules and systems due to pricing competition, demand fluctuations, and significant overcapacity in the industry. Our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders. Our financial viability and bankability also enable us to offer meaningful module and system warranties after installation, which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to some of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering PV solar energy solutions to long-term owners. Furthermore, we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business.
Sustainability
In addition to our financial commitments, we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle, from raw material sourcing through end-of-life module recycling. Accordingly, our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change, energy security, and water scarcity, which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives. On a lifecycle basis, our thin film module technology has the smallest carbon footprint, fastest energy payback time, and lowest water use of any PV solar technology on the market.
As a result of our specialized manufacturing process, the carbon footprint of our modules is up to six times lower than conventional crystalline silicon modules and a fraction of the carbon footprint of conventional energy sources. Furthermore, our technology displaces up to 98% of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation. Our manufacturing process also facilitates the fastest energy payback time (which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it) of all PV solar technologies. In less than six months under high irradiance conditions, our systems produce more energy than was required to create them, which represents a 50-fold energy return on investment over a 25-year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid. Our modules also use up to 400 times less water per MW hour than conventional energy and up to 24 times less water than other PV solar technologies. In addition, our industry-leading 
 4

recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90% of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90% of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules.
Offerings and Capabilities
We are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a least-cost, best-fit energy solution, particularly in regions with high solar resources, significant current or projected electricity demand, and/or relatively high existing electricity prices. We differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution, as needed. Our consultative approach to our customers’ solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals. As a result, we have designed our product and service offerings according to the following business areas:

• | PV Solar Modules. Our modules couple our leading-edge CdTe technology with the manufacturing excellence and quality control that comes from being one of the world’s most experienced producers of advanced PV solar modules. Our technology demonstrates a proven performance advantage over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating by delivering higher real-world energy yield and long-term reliability. We are able to provide such product performance, quality, and reliability to our customers due, in large part, to investing more in R&D than most other solar companies in the world.


• | Utility-Scale Power Plant. We have extensive, proven experience in developing and constructing reliable grid-connected power systems for utility-scale generation. Our grid-connected systems diversify the energy portfolio, reduce fossil-fuel consumption, mitigate the risk of fuel price volatility, and save costs, proving that centralized solar generation can deliver dependable and affordable solar electricity to the grid around the world. Our plant control systems provide reliability services, such as frequency control, voltage control, ramping capacity, and automated generation control, which enable expanded integration of PV solar power systems into the power grid. Such reliability services also help balance the grid during times of high renewable energy generation. Our solar energy systems also offer a meaningful value proposition by eliminating commodity price risks thereby providing a long-term fixed price with relatively low operating costs. When compared to the price of power derived from a conventional source of energy, a fixed price cannot be achieved unless the cost of hedging is included. Hedging costs of a commodity such as natural gas, along with the costs of credit support required for a long-term hedge, can significantly increase conventional energy costs. Additional benefits of our grid-connected power systems include reductions of fuel imports and improvements in energy security, enhanced peaking generation and faster time-to-power, and managed variability through accurate forecasting.


• | EPC Services. We provide engineering, procurement, and construction (“EPC”) services to projects developed by us and other system owners such as utilities, independent power producers, and commercial and industrial companies. EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. Depending on the customer and market needs, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities. Our vertical integration combined with our partner collaboration enables us to identify and make system-level innovations, which creates further value for our customers.


• | Battery Storage. To further enhance the operational capabilities of utility-scale systems, we also provide storage solutions using advanced battery technology. Such storage solutions enable system owners to better align the delivery of energy with periods of peak demand, thereby increasing a system’s overall value. Storage capabilities also allow PV solar plants to meet or exceed the peaking capabilities of fossil fuel-based plants at potentially lower costs. Our advanced plant control systems manage the operations of both the PV solar plant and its storage capabilities to ensure accurate delivery of requested power to the grid. As part of our storage solutions, we also provide proprietary algorithms to design and simulate the optimal dispatch of a system depending on the customer and market needs, including site-specific weather conditions.

 5


• | O&M Services. By leveraging our extensive experience in plant optimization and advanced diagnostics, we have developed one of the largest and most advanced O&M programs in the industry, including more than 8 GWDC of utility-scale PV solar power systems, while maintaining an average fleet system effective availability greater than 99%. Utilizing a state of the art global operations center, our team of O&M associates provide a variety of services to optimize system performance and comply with power purchase agreements (“PPA”), other project agreements, and regulations. Our products and services are engineered to enable the maximization of energy output and revenue for our customers while significantly reducing their unplanned maintenance costs. Plant owners benefit from predictable expenses over the life of the contract and reduced risk of energy loss. Our O&M program is compliant with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) standards and is designed to scale to accommodate the growing O&M needs of customers worldwide. We offer our O&M services to solar power plant owners that use either our solar modules or modules manufactured by third-parties.

Market Overview
Solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to and/or substitute for traditional forms of energy generation. In recent years, the price of PV solar power systems, and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems, has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets. This rapid price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives. Other technological developments in the industry, such as the development of storage capabilities, have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as a competitive alternative to traditional forms of energy generation. Furthermore, the fact that a PV solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets. Once installed, PV solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to many other forms of generation. In addition to these economic benefits, solar energy has substantial environmental benefits. For example, PV solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets. Worldwide solar markets continue to develop, aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices, both at the module and system level, which have made solar power one of the most economical sources of energy.
Module average selling prices in global markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future. In the aggregate, we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity, relative to global demand, and the ability for additional capacity expansion. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing. We believe the solar industry is currently in such a period, due in part to recent developments in China, which include feed-in-tariff reductions causing deferment of in-country project development. Additionally, intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly, thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers, EPC companies, and vertically-integrated companies such as First Solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability. In light of such market realities, we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation, which include our advanced module and system technologies, our manufacturing process, our vertically-integrated business model, our financial viability, and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems.
Global Markets
We have established and are continuing to develop a global business presence. Energy markets are by their nature localized, with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application. Accordingly, our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our PV solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications. The following markets represent the key markets for our PV solar modules and systems.
 6

The Americas
United States. Multiple markets within the United States, which accounted for 66% of our 2018 net sales, exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market, including (i) sizeable electricity demand, particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas; (ii) strong demand for renewable energy generation; and (iii) abundant solar resources. In those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced, our PV solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation. The market penetration of PV solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs, including the current 30% federal investment tax credit, as described under “Support Programs.” We have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing, engineering, constructing, and maintaining utility-scale power plants in the United States, particularly in California and other southwestern states, and increasingly in southeastern states. Currently, our solar projects in the United States represent the majority of the advanced-stage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Systems Project Pipeline” for more information about these projects.
Other Americas. Outside the United States, we have drawn on our industry expertise and module technology advantages to make inroads in certain Central and South American markets. Accordingly, we continue to pursue module sale opportunities in Mexico and Brazil while monitoring opportunities in other countries with high growth potential.
Asia-Pacific
Australia. Australia is a promising region for PV solar energy with strong growth expected to continue over the next several years. In September 2018, we completed the sale of our 49 MWAC Manildra project located in New South Wales, and in July 2018, we executed definitive sale agreements for the sale of our 87 MWAC Beryl project also located in New South Wales. The region’s strong growth is being driven by several factors, including an increased demand for PPAs from Australian commercial and industrial companies, certain government programs, and continued procurement from local utilities as well as the emergence of a merchant power market. We continue to focus our efforts in the region on utility-scale project development, including our self-developed projects in Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria, while increasing our O&M services and third-party module sales.
Japan. Japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics, which make them attractive markets for PV solar energy. In particular, Japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports. Following the Fukushima earthquake in 2011, the country introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power. Accordingly, the Japanese government announced a long-term goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and provided various incentives for solar power installations. In recent years, we have partnered with local companies to develop, construct, and operate PV solar power systems, which will further mitigate Japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power. In 2018, we completed the sale of multiple projects in Japan totaling 62 MWAC and expect to continue providing O&M services to such projects in the future. Separately, we began operating a 59 MWAC project in Ishikawa prefecture and commenced construction of a 40 MWAC project in Miyagi prefecture. We continue to pursue other utility-scale project development, O&M, and module sale opportunities in the region.
Europe, the Middle East, and India
Europe. Many markets across Europe reflect strong demand for PV solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation. In particular, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, and Spain are all running tenders in which utility-scale PV solar projects can bid for capacity. Such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for further growth in the demand for PV solar energy beyond the region’s installed generation capacity of approximately 120 GWDC. We continue to pursue module sales activities in multiple countries, such as France and Turkey, while working with certain local partners for the distribution of our modules.
 7

The Middle East. The market potential for solar energy in the Middle East continues to be driven by a combination of strong economic fundamentals, aggressive tariff pricing, abundant solar resources, and robust policy. The United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan have established utility-scale solar programs, which are at varying degrees of maturity. The UAE and Jordan lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the amount of renewable energy in their generation portfolios. Oman, Qatar, and Kuwait are also promising markets with indicators of future potential for solar energy. While there are several motives for investing in solar energy, including energy security, diversification of generation portfolios, and the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons, the common factor is that the economics of PV solar energy have made it a compelling energy generation source. We have sold approximately 350 MWDC of modules in the region and continue to pursue additional module sales opportunities.
India. India continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for PV solar energy with an installed generation capacity of nearly 25 GWDC, another 12 GWDC of projects in development or construction, and over 20 GWDC of new procurement programs announced. In addition, the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets, which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100 GWDC by 2022. These targets, along with various policy and regulatory measures, help create significant and sustained demand for PV solar energy. Accordingly, we expect to continue selling modules to local integrators and operators of systems to address the region’s energy needs. In March 2018, we completed the sale of our Winsol and Hindupur projects located in Andhra Pradesh, which total 155 MWAC. We also own and operate two additional projects located in Karnataka, totaling 40 MWAC, for which we have secured rights to sell power under separate 25-year PPAs to state owned electricity distribution companies. In addition, we continue to maintain our strong module presence in the region with approximately 2 GWDC of installed modules.
Support Programs
Although we compete in many markets that do not require solar-specific government subsidies or support programs, our net sales and profits remain subject, in the near term, to regulation and variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives, such as quotas, renewable portfolio standards, and tendering systems. In addition to these support programs, financial incentives for PV solar energy generation may include tax incentives, grants, loans, rebates, and production incentives. Although we expect to become less impacted by, and less dependent on these forms of government support over time, such programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of PV solar power systems around the world.
In Europe, renewable energy targets, in conjunction with tenders for utility-scale PV solar and other support measures, have contributed to the growth in PV solar markets. Renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources, while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors. Various European Union (“EU”) directives on renewable energy have set targets for all EU member states in support of the goal of a 32% share of energy from renewable sources in the EU by 2030.
Tax incentive programs exist in the United States at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements. At the federal level, investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s. In 2015, the U.S. Congress extended the 30% federal energy investment tax credit (“ITC”) for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019. In February 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 modified the ITC by replacing the requirement to place solar projects in service by a certain date with a requirement to begin construction by a certain date. In June 2018, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) released new guidance to determine when construction has begun on a solar project. Accordingly, projects that commence construction in 2019 will be eligible for the 30% ITC. The credit will step down to 26% for projects that commence construction in 2020, 22% for projects that commence construction in 2021, and 10% for projects that commence construction thereafter. The ITC has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the United States, and its extension has contributed to greater medium-term demand visibility. The positive impact of the ITC depends to a 
 8

large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing, and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing. The eventual step-down of the ITC to 10% underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity (“LCOE”), meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life, of solar systems to continue to remain competitive with other sources of energy generation.
In October 2017, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous U.S. presidential administration’s Clean Power Plan, which established standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities. In August 2018, the U.S. EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE rule would replace the Clean Power Plan, which the U.S. EPA has proposed to repeal. Accordingly, there is significant uncertainty regarding what effects, if any, the ACE rule may have on PV solar markets. 
The majority of states in the United States have also enacted legislation adopting Renewable Portfolio Standard (“RPS”) mechanisms. Under a RPS, regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to end-user customers from eligible renewable resources, such as solar energy generation facilities, by a specified date. Some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies. RPS legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state, particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s RPS, the definition of eligible renewable energy resources, and the extent to which renewable energy credits (certificates representing the generation of renewable energy) qualify for RPS compliance.
Measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its RPS mandate, California’s RPS program is the most significant in the United States, and the California market for renewable energy has dominated the western United States region for the past several years. First enacted in 2002, California’s RPS statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance. Pursuant to amendments enacted by the California Legislature in 2015, the California RPS program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50% of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030. In 2018, approximately 38% of our total net sales were derived from module and system sales in California.
Various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector, including the solar energy sector, and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change. For more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – The reduction, elimination, or expiration of government subsidies, economic incentives, tax incentives, renewable energy targets, and other support for on-grid solar electricity applications, or other adverse public policies, such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules, could negatively impact demand and/or price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales, thereby adversely impacting our operating results.”
Business Segments
We operate our business in two segments. Our modules segment involves the design, manufacture, and sale of CdTe solar modules, which convert sunlight into electricity. Third-party customers of our modules segment include integrators and operators of PV solar power systems. Our second segment is our fully integrated systems segment, through which we provide complete turn-key PV solar power systems, or solar solutions, that draw upon our capabilities, which include (i) project development, (ii) EPC services, and (iii) O&M services. We may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity. All of our systems segment products and services are for PV solar power systems, which primarily use our solar modules, and we sell such products and services to utilities, independent power producers, commercial and 
 9

industrial companies, and other system owners. Additionally within our systems segment, we may temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors. See Note 22. “Segment and Geographical Information” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments.
Modules Business
Solar Modules
Since the inception of First Solar, our flagship module has been manufactured using our advanced CdTe thin film technology. Each Series 6 module, the latest generation of our flagship module, is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft (123cm x 201cm) in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials, and our legacy Series 4 module is approximately 2ft x 4ft (60cm x 120cm) in size with similar technology and materials. In April 2018, we commenced commercial production of our Series 6 modules, which have an average rated power per module of approximately 420 watts. Our legacy Series 4 modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 119 watts, 118 watts, and 114 watts for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our modules offer up to 8% more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules of equivalent efficiency rating and generally include anti-reflective coated glass, which further enhances energy production. Our module semiconductor structure is a single-junction polycrystalline thin film that uses CdTe as the absorption layer. CdTe has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 1-2% of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules.
Manufacturing Process
We manufacture our CdTe solar modules on integrated production lines in an automated, proprietary, and continuous process. Our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity. Our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time-consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. We currently manufacture solar modules at our Perrysburg, Ohio; Kulim, Malaysia; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam manufacturing facilities.
Our CdTe manufacturing process includes the following three stages: (i) the deposition stage, (ii) the cell definition and treatment stage, and (iii) the assembly and test stage. In the deposition stage, panels of transparent oxide-coated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned, laser-mark identified with a serial number, heated, and coated with thin layers of CdTe and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology, after which the semiconductor-coated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength. In the cell definition and treatment stage, we use high-speed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output. In this stage, we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance, and we apply a metal sputtered back contact. In the assembly and test stage, we apply busbars, inter-layer material, and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device. We then apply anti-reflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module’s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight. Finally, junction boxes, termination wires, and an under-mount frame (for Series 6 modules) are applied to complete the assembly.
We maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met. Acceptance testing for electrical leakage, visual quality, and power measurement on a solar simulator are also conducted prior to preparing a module for shipment. The quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program, subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. These programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability.
 10

Research and Development
Our R&D model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration, from advanced research to product development, manufacturing, and applications. We continue to devote substantial resources to our R&D efforts, which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules. We also focus our R&D activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies, including throughput improvement, volume ramp, and material cost reduction. Based on publicly available information, we are one of the leaders in R&D investment among PV solar module manufacturers, maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid wattage gains and cost reductions.
In the course of our R&D activities, we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules. We primarily conduct our R&D activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our Perrysburg, Ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines. We believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines. In addition, our respective Series 6 and Series 4 production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and, as a result, a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines.
We regularly produce research cells in our laboratories, some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions. Our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability. Our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years. We currently hold two world records for CdTe PV efficiency, achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 22.1% and a full aperture area module efficiency of 18.6%. We believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential long-term module efficiency entitlement of over 20% using our commercial-scale manufacturing equipment.
Customers
During 2018, we sold the majority of our solar modules (not included in our systems projects) to integrators and operators of systems in the United States, Australia, and France, and such third-party module sales represented approximately 22% of our total net sales. During 2018, M.A. Mortenson Company, RCR O'Donnell Griffin Pty, Ltd, and Tampa Electric Company each accounted for more than 10% of our modules business net sales.
We continue to invest in key geographic markets, particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand, and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base. We also collaborate with strategic partners in community solar solutions, which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops. Community solar utilizes relatively small ground-mounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities, which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource. The demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are enacting community solar policies, and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable, clean energy. We also collaborate with providers of Community Choice Aggregation programs, which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices. Our expertise in module technology and utility-scale generation, paired with community solar and/or Community Choice Aggregation, allows residential power consumers to “go solar,” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels.
Competition
The solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry. We 
 11

face intense competition for sales of solar modules, which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share. With respect to our modules business, our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers. In addition, we expect to compete with future entrants into the PV solar industry that offer new or differentiated technological solutions. We also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce PV solar cells, solar modules, or turn-key production lines. Within the larger electric power industry, we also compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies (including wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and tidal technologies), as well as traditional energy generation sources.
Certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital, which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time. Among PV solar module manufacturers, the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt, conversion efficiency, energy yield, reliability, warranty terms, and customer payment terms. If competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs, or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We believe the solar industry is currently in such a period, due in part to recent developments in China, which include feed-in-tariff reductions causing deferment of in-country project development. For additional information, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense, and could remain that way for an extended period of time. An increased global supply of PV modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global PV module supply exceeds demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Raw Materials
Our CdTe module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module. One critical raw material in our production process is CdTe. Of the other raw materials and components, the following are also critical to our manufacturing process: front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide, other semiconductor materials, organics such as photo resist, tempered back glass, frames, packaging components such as interlayer, cord plate/cord plate cap, lead wire, and solar connectors. Before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process, a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures, and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmaps. When possible, we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations, reducing the cost and lead times for such materials. Several of our key raw materials and components are either single-sourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers.
Solar Module Collection and Recycling
We are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle. As part of such efforts, we previously established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program. Our module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials, including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material, for use in new modules or other products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives. Approximately 90% of each collected First Solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse. For legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program, we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules, and the end-users agreed to notify us, disassemble their solar power systems, package the solar modules for shipment, and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives. We currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Malaysia, and Vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility location in Germany.
The EU’s Waste Electronics and Electrical Equipment (“WEEE”) directive places the obligation of recycling (including collection, treatment, and environmentally sound disposal) of electrical and electronic equipment products upon 
 12

producers, and such directive is applicable to PV solar modules in EU member states. For modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the EU, we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program. Additionally, as a result of the transposition of the WEEE directive by the EU member states, we have adjusted our offerings, as required, in various EU member states to ensure compliance with specific EU member state WEEE regulations.
Solar Module Warranties
We provide a limited PV solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years. We also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreed-upon specifications will produce at least 98% of their labeled power output rating during the first year, with the warranty coverage reducing by 0.5% every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25-year limited power output warranty period. As an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty, we also offer to certain customers an aggregated or system-level limited module performance warranty. This system-level limited module performance warranty is designed for utility-scale systems and provides 25-year system-level energy degradation protection. For additional information on our solar module warranty programs, refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Problems with product quality or performance, including our Series 4 modules and Series 6 modules, may cause us to incur significant and/or unexpected contractual damages and/or warranty and related expenses, damage our market reputation, and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share.”
Systems Business
Project Development
Project development activities generally include (i) site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site, (ii) obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies, (iii) executing an interconnection agreement, (iv) obtaining environmental and land-use permits, (v) maintaining effective site control, and (vi) entering into a PPA with an off-taker of the power to be generated by the project. The sequence of such development activities varies by international location and, in certain locations, may begin by initially bidding for PPA or off-take agreements. These activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a PV solar power system.
Depending on the market opportunity or geographic location, we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process, construct a system incorporating our modules, and sell the system to a long-term owner. We may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities. Depending on the type of project or geographic location, PPAs or FiT structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project. Depending primarily on the location, stage of development upon our acquisition of the project, and/or other site attributes, the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but may be as long as five years. We may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive, or capable of being built. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets, and the termination rights of the off-taker under the PPA may be triggered.
EPC Services
EPC services include engineering design and related services, BoS procurement, advanced development of grid integration solutions, and construction contracting and management. Depending on the customer and market need, we may provide our full EPC services or any combination of individual products and services within our EPC capabilities. We conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the EPC agreement. For PV solar power systems we construct, we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design, installation, and BoS part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system. We may also provide an energy 
 13

performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation, after certain adjustments, such as irradiance, weather, module degradation, soiling, curtailment, and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality, design, or construction.
O&M Services
Our typical O&M service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a PV solar power system. We perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract. These activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with PPAs, other agreements, and regulations. Although the scope of our services may vary by contract, our O&M service arrangements generally include 24/7 system monitoring, certain PPA and other agreement compliance, NERC compliance, large generator interconnection agreement compliance, energy forecasting, performance engineering analysis, regular performance reporting, turn-key maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair, warranty management, and environmental services. As part of our O&M services, we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee, which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider, such as weather, curtailment, outages, force majeure, and other conditions that may affect system availability.
Customers
Our systems customers consist of utilities, independent power producers, commercial and industrial companies, and other system owners, such as investors who are looking for long-term investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns. Such customers may purchase completed systems, which include our solar modules, or any combination of development, EPC services, and/or O&M services. During 2018, the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in the United States, Japan, and India, and the principal customers of our systems business were Tampa Electric Company, Capital Dynamics, Inc. (“Capital Dynamics”), Mitsui & Co., D.E. Shaw, and IDFC Alternatives, who each accounted for more than 10% of our systems business net sales.
In certain markets, the emergence of utility-owned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through rate-basing utility investments. Given their long-term ownership profile, utility-owned generation customers typically seek to partner with vertically-integrated companies, such as First Solar, who can provide a broad spectrum of utility-scale generation solutions, including reliable PV solar technology, project development and construction, and O&M services, thereby mitigating their long-term ownership risks.
The wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utility-scale PV solar power system expertise. The demand for corporate renewables is accelerating, with corporations worldwide committing to the RE100 campaign, a collaborative, global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. We believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers’ sensitivity to the experience, bankability, and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations. With our strong development expertise, financial strength, and global footprint, we are well positioned to meet their needs. For example, our 227 MWAC Muscle Shoals project and 58 MWAC Cove Mountain Solar 1 project are expected to provide energy for certain Facebook, Inc. data centers through PPAs with Tennessee Valley Authority and PacifiCorp, respectively. Since our first corporate related PPA with Apple Inc., we have contracted over 700 MWAC of PPAs associated with corporate customers to support their renewable energy goals.
Competition
With respect to our systems business, we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions, including developers of PV solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects, such as wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and tidal projects. To the extent other solar module manufacturers become more 
 14

vertically integrated, we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well. We also face competition from other EPC companies and joint venture type arrangements between EPC companies and solar companies. Certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital and/or access to foreign capital. The decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide, and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the PV solar value chain, depending on the geographic market. Accordingly, competition at the system level can be intense, thereby exerting downward pressure on system-level average selling prices industry-wide. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Competition at the system level can be intense, thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on system-level profit margins industry-wide, which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations.”
Research and Development
Our systems related R&D activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the LCOE of a PV solar power system through reductions in BoS costs, improved system design, and energy yield enhancements associated with systems that use our modules. Such R&D efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid integration and reliability. We conduct our R&D activities for systems primarily in the United States. Innovations related to system design, inverters and power converters, hardware platforms and installation techniques, and know-how, among other things, can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce BoS costs, which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utility-scale PV solar power system.
Own and Operate
From time to time, we may temporarily own and operate, or retain interests in, certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors. The ability to do so provides certain potential benefits, including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets, including Chile, India, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region. As an owner and operator of certain systems in the United States, we may be subject to the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), as well as various other federal, state, and local regulatory bodies. For more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors – As an owner and operator of PV solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid, certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under U.S. federal and state law, which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth.” For more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as associate and third-party confidentiality agreements, to safeguard our intellectual property. We regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our R&D activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the United States and other countries. Our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek, or at all, and any patents we may receive may be challenged, invalidated, or declared unenforceable. In addition, we have registered and/or have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for “First Solar.”
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on, among other things, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our PV solar module manufacturing processes, including our unique materials sourcing, involve proprietary know-how, technology, or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures. We have taken security measures to protect these elements. Our R&D personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These 
 15

agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions, designs, and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us. We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules, technology, or business plans. We have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims.
Environmental, Health, and Safety Matters
Our operations include the use, handling, storage, transportation, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. We are subject to various national, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the use, management, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes; occupational health and safety; and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third-party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or non-compliance with environmental permits required for our operations. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future. However, future developments such as the implementation of new, more stringent laws and regulations, more aggressive enforcement policies, or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Corporate History
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2006 and completed our initial public offering of common stock in November 2006.
Associates
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 6,400 associates (our term for full and part-time employees), including approximately 5,100 in our modules business and approximately 500 associates that work directly in our systems business. The remainder of our associates are in R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative positions. None of our associates are currently represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. As we expand domestically and internationally, we may encounter either regional laws that mandate union representation or associates who desire union representation or a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our associates are good.
