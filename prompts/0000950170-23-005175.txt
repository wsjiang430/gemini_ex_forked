 Item 1. Business
 We are a medical technology company focused on the design, development, and advancement of technology for better surgical treatment of spinal disorders. Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Alphatec Spine, Inc., SafeOp Surgical, Inc. and EOS imaging S.A., our mission is to revolutionize the approach to spine surgery through clinical distinction. We are focused on developing new approaches that integrate seamlessly with our expanding Alpha InformatiX product platform to better inform surgery and to achieve the goal of spine surgery more predictably and reproducibly. We have a broad product portfolio designed to address the spine’s various pathologies. Our ultimate vision is to be the standard bearer in spine.
 In 2018, we embarked on a business transformation that has replaced 100% of the executive team, 94% of our Board of Directors, and over 90% of the remaining team with experienced professionals. Efforts that year founded our Organic Innovation Machine, our in-house product design, development and testing capabilities aimed at the creation of clinical distinction, and furthered the strategic transition of our sales force to a more dedicated, clinically astute team.
From 2019 through 2021, our focus was on building a foundation capable of supporting the organization as we scale into a larger business. We developed and released several key elements of our approach-based portfolio, including a comprehensive posterior fixation system and approach-specific IdentiTi implants. We also acquired and integrated SafeOp, technology that integrates with our approaches to provide information about both the location and the health of nerves intra-operatively. SafeOp became the informational backbone of the Prone TransPsoas (“PTP”) approach, which we developed and launched in 2020 to advance lateral spine surgery. We invested in new headquarters to substantially increase surgeon and sales training capacity and opened a distribution facility in Memphis, TN to ensure predictable and expedient surgical support as we grow. We also acquired EOS imaging to expand on the informational competitive advantage established with SafeOp. EOS systems enable full-body, calibrated, 3D images that integrate throughout the arch of patient spine care to influence procedure planning and improve and objectify the understanding of global alignment. As we execute against our vision for EOS technology, we believe it will set new standards for spine care.


Our ability to leverage our collective spine experience, coupled with a willingness to invest in every component of the advanced spine approaches that we bring to market has fueled market-leading growth in every year since early 2018.
Revenue from products and services was $350.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of $108.6 million, or 45% compared to $242.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We believe our future success will continue to be propelled by the introduction and traction of the distinct procedures and technologies that our procedural investment thesis engenders. We feel that Alphatec is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on spine market dynamics.
 Recent Developments
 Term Loan
 On January 6, 2023, we entered into a $150.0 million term loan (the "Braidwell Term Loan") with Braidwell Transaction Holdings, LLC. The Braidwell Term Loan provides for an initial term loan of $100.0 million which was funded on the closing date. We have the option to draw an additional $50.0 million within 18 months of the closing date. The Braidwell Term Loan matures in January 2028. Borrowings under the Braidwell Term Loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a rate per annum equal to the secured overnight financing rate for such SOFR business day ("Term SOFR") plus 5.75%. The outstanding portion of the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets with the priority interest of the lenders in the Braidwell Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, as defined below, subject to terms of a customary intercreditor agreement.
Revolving Credit Facility
 In September 2022, we entered into a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with entities affiliated with MidCap Financial Trust (“MidCap”). The Revolving Credit Facility provides up to $50.0 million in borrowing capacity based on a borrowing base. The borrowing base is calculated based on certain accounts receivable and inventory assets. We may request a $25.0 million increase in the Revolving Credit Facility for a total commitment of up to $75.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of September 29, 2027, or 90 days prior to the final maturity date of any of our unsecured Senior Convertible Notes (the "2026 Notes").
The outstanding loans bear interest at the sum of Term SOFR, plus 3.5% per annum. Interest on borrowings is due monthly. The loan agreements include an unused line fee, which is calculated as 0.50% per annum of either the unused Revolving Credit Facility or a minimum balance. Upon the Revolving Credit Facility’s maturity, any outstanding principal balance, unpaid accrued interest, and all other obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be due and payable.
The Revolving Credit Facility contains a lockbox arrangement clause requiring us to maintain a lockbox bank account. If the revolving loan availability is less than 30% of the revolving loan limit for five consecutive business days, or if we are in default, MidCap will apply funds collected from our lockbox account to reduce the outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit Facility.
The outstanding loans are secured by substantially all of our assets with the priority interest of the lenders in the Braidwell Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility subject to terms of a customer intercreditor agreement. The loan agreements and other ancillary documents contain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. Under the loan agreements, we are required to maintain a minimum level of liquidity. The loan agreements also include certain events of default, and upon the occurrence of such events of default, all outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated and/or the lenders’ commitments terminated.
Strategy
 Our vision is to be the standard bearer in spine. By leveraging our team’s extensive spine experience to create clinically distinct solutions that improve surgical outcomes, we believe that we are positioned to continue to earn share of the U.S. spine market, becoming the partner of choice for spine surgeons, hospitals, healthcare systems, and payors.


To achieve our vision and build long-term value, we continue to prioritize the following three vital initiatives:
 1. Create Clinical Distinction
 We are committed to continuing to invest in the development, launch, and promotion of approaches and technologies intended to revolutionize spine surgery. We have developed, and continue to seek to develop, next-generation surgical approaches that advance spine care with seamlessly integrated access systems, implants, positioners, biologics and enabling technologies uniquely designed to beget objective decision-making and to more successfully address the core spine pathologies.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we continued to drive adoption of the PTP approach, while securing over 40% growth in the EOS opportunity pipeline and executing against developmental initiatives that will further EOS' spine capabilities. We advanced the medialized MIS posterior approach with the Sigma Medialized Access System and the Calibrate PSX Expandable Interbody Implant System, our first expandable interbody implant system. Our pursuit to perfect our procedures inspired the launch of over 10 new technologies during the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, our comprehensive portfolio now boasts over 90 products across various product categories, of which more than half were launched between July 2018 and December 2022.
With the expansion and increasing capabilities of our product portfolio, we continue to drive year-over-year growth in the number of product categories used per surgery, average revenue per surgery and revenue per surgeon. Aggregate product categories used per surgery expanded to 2.2 for the full-year 2022, compared to 2.0 in the prior year. For the full year 2022, average revenue per surgery expanded 25% and revenue per surgeon increased 17% compared to 2021.
Looking to 2023 and beyond, we intend to continue to pioneer spine innovation. As such, we expect continued growth in the number of products sold into each surgery, revenue per surgery, and revenue per surgeon.
2. Compel Surgeon Adoption
 An integral part of our strategy is to compel surgeon adoption of the innovation that we have and will continue to introduce. Central to inspiring surgeon interest is the “ATEC Experience”, an outcomes-based educational program for visiting surgeons facilitated at our headquarters in Carlsbad, CA. The program provides an interactive learning environment tailored to surgeon needs through both a peer-to-peer and subject matter expert approach. We leverage our state-of-the-art, 7-station cadaveric lab to enable visiting surgeons to gain deep practical experience with our procedural solutions and educate participants on our role in shaping innovation.
The surgeon relationships we are creating through that educational program continue to drive strong growth, evidenced by both the increase in surgeon participation in the program and the continued growth of surgeon adoption. Over 400 new and existing surgeons participated in the ATEC Experience in 2022, driving growth in our surgeon user base in 2022 and positioning us well for future growth as we cultivate the surgeon relationships we are creating. Revenue attributable to new surgeon customers has continued to contribute meaningfully to revenue growth overall. Surgeon utilization is also expanding as we earn surgeon confidence and foster surgeon training programs that extend the application of our procedural solutions to increasingly complex spine care.
3. Elevate Distribution
 We market and sell our products through a strategic network of independent sales agents and direct sales representatives.

To deliver consistent, predictable growth, we have added, and intend to continue to add, clinically astute and exclusive independent sales agents and direct sales representatives to reach untapped surgeons, hospitals, and national accounts and better penetrate existing accounts and territories. We believe the opportunity to expand our strategic sales network is vast, with approximately one third of U.S. territories, including many of the U.S.' most significant spine markets, still under- or completely unrepresented.


With our acquisition of EOS in 2021, we aligned EOS’ U.S.-based capital sales team with our regional sales teams and leadership. The EOS sales team will continue to focus on hospital administrators now with the benefit of leads generated by our strategic sales team and enhanced service support.
As we seek to optimize sales productivity, we continually work to upgrade our sales team training and education efforts. That, coupled with the clinical distinction-fueled increase in surgeon adoption drove 39% growth in revenue per established territory in 2022, marking the beginnings of our ability to lever years of investment to elevate our sales channel.
In 2022, we enhanced the expertise within our Memphis distribution facility which opened in 2021. With expedient, flexible access to nearby distribution centers, we believe the facility will ensure centralized surgical support as we grow.
We are in the nascent stages of building an international footprint. In 2022, we commenced a process that will secure regulatory approvals for Australia and Japan and invested in a team and support structure to foster sales in New Zealand. Looking forward, we intend to focus our international investments in economically attractive markets with strong surgeon influence and reasonable regulatory pathways where we believe we can build a direct sales team with the sophistication of our U.S. network.
 Spine Anatomy
 The spine is the core of the human skeleton and provides important structural support and alignment while remaining flexible to allow movement. The spine is a column of 33 bones that protects the spinal cord and provides the main support for the body. Each bony segment of the spine is referred to as a vertebra (two or more are called vertebrae). The spine has five regions containing groups of similar bones, listed from top to bottom: seven cervical vertebrae in the neck, twelve thoracic vertebrae in the mid-back (each attached to a rib), five lumbar vertebrae in the lower back, five sacral vertebrae fused together to form one bone called the sacrum, which sits in the pelvis, and four coccygeal bones fused together that form the tailbone. At the front of each vertebra is a block of bone called the vertebral body. Vertebrae are stacked on top of each other and separated from each other through a cushioning intervertebral disc in the front, and bony joints in the back, which create the stability and mobility needed for sitting, standing, and walking. Strong muscles and bones, flexible tendons and ligaments, and sensitive nerves contribute to a healthy spine. Pain can be caused when any of these structures is affected by strain, injury, or disease.
The Alphatec Solution
 Our procedural investment thesis is unique. Unlike most of our peers, we take a holistic approach to the procedures that we bring to market, willingly investing not just in the highest dollar components of the procedure, but also in the clinically distinct technology that can enhance clinical predictability and reproducibility. As a result, our procedures uniquely incorporate the technology engendered by that thesis: objective information capable of informing the entire continuum of spine patient care and integrated, ergonomic patient positioning and surgical access technology.
 Our principal offerings include comprehensive procedural solutions designed and developed to specifically meet the requirements of the various spine approaches that treat conditions ranging from degenerative disc disease to complex deformity and trauma. Depending on the approach, our solutions may comprise objective and automated pre-, intra-, and post-operative information, positioners, access systems, interbody implants, fixation systems, and various biologics offerings; all designed to more predictably improve patient outcomes by achieving the three goals of spine surgery: (1) decompression, (2) stabilization, and (3) alignment.
 To deliver on our goal of driving above-market revenue growth, we continue to leverage investments made to equip the sales channel with a clinically distinct portfolio and to build a strong pipeline of innovation that will compel surgeon adoption well into the future. While new products launched since new management took over in late 2017 accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in 2018, that percentage increased to 91% in 2022.

Our flagship approach, the PTP approach, was designed and released in 2020 to directly address the known challenges that limited earlier adoption of the technique by the team that created the original lateral approach for spinal fusion. Engineered to leverage the benefits achieved by lateral spinal fusion procedures, such as reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery times, PTP treats a wide range of patient pathologies and, to date, surgeons have performed over 5,500 PTP procedures.
Compared to a standard lateral procedure, the PTP approach positions the patient in a prone (face down) position, allowing simultaneous access to the spine laterally (from the side) and posteriorly (from the back), all while in a more familiar surgical position and offering a more streamlined approach. Single-position lateral surgery in the prone position minimizes unnecessary patient repositioning, enhances time efficiencies, provides surgeons with increased optionality, and achieves spinal alignment objectives more reproducibly. 
The PTP procedure is enabled through a combination of purposefully-developed technologies that address the unique challenges of approaching the spine laterally while prone. One such challenge, and probably the greatest limit to earlier adoption of lateral approaches overall, is the need to safely and predictably navigate across the lumbar plexus, an essential collection of nerves, to access the lumbar spine during surgery. Key to our PTP approach is the integration of SafeOp Advanced Neuromonitoring, a proprietary technology that couples automated electromyographic (“EMG”) and somatosensory evoked potential (“SSEP”) monitoring. SafeOp technology, as a result, is designed to uniquely beget real-time, surgeon-directed intra-operative information about both the location and the health of the patient’s nerves, enhancing the predictability and reproducibility of lateral approach outcomes.
Our Technology
 Positioners
 We have developed approach-specific patient positioning systems that integrate with our other access systems, providing for a more rigid construct and enhanced reproducibility. The PTP Patient Positioning System, for example, was developed specifically for the PTP procedure as an adjunct to the Sigma-PTP Access System. Designed to maximize the positional effects of having the patient in a prone position while streamlining operating room setup, PTP enables a single-position surgery. Key features include bi-lateral structural support to minimize patient movement, adjustable side paddle position to accommodate varying patient habitus, an integrated bed-rail system and compatibility with the Jackson frame. In addition, the system’s ultra-radiolucent carbon fiber frame is designed to help enhance fluoroscopic visibility and its coronal bending mechanism is designed to create reproducible access to L4-5 and upper lumbar regions.
Access Systems
 We have differentiated surgical access instruments that are designed to maximize patient outcomes through enhanced visibility and rigidity, intuitive orthogonality, and approach-specific exposure. We offer several split-blade retractors which allow for direct, illuminated visualization and freedom of maneuverability within the operative corridor. Our retractors also provide for stable positioning by attaching directly to the surgical table. We also offer procedure-specific access systems, including our Sigma-ALIF Access System which allows for custom anterior abdominal exposure through freehand placement of dissecting blades and connection to a ringed frame. The Sigma-ALIF Access System provides an unobstructed working corridor with custom features to enable an ALIF approach in either supine or lateral decubitus.
 EOS Imaging
 Our EOS imaging system provides unbiased, high-quality, and calibrated full-body imaging that enables a precise 3D model of patients’ skeletal systems and provides valuable diagnostic and surgical planning capabilities. The integration of our approach-specific solutions into EOS’ 3D surgical planning platform is expected to better inform surgery and enhance the predictability of outcomes by allowing surgeons to more effectively assess patients’ full-body alignment, establish surgical objectives, and simulate surgery with optimized implants.


Alpha InformatiX
Our Alpha InformatiX ("AIX") product platform comprises the SafeOp Neural InformatiX System and the VEA alignment mobile application.
The SafeOp Neural InformatiX System was the first advanced technology to launch from the AIX product platform. SafeOp is a patented technology that automates both EMG and SSEP monitoring. As a result, the system can provide surgeons with objective, real-time, and actionable information about both nerve location and nerve health intra-operatively on a small, easy-to-use tablet platform. Integration of the information with our advanced access, implant, and fixation technologies equips surgeons with procedural solutions designed to enhance safety, efficiency, and reproducibility.
The VEA mobile alignment application is designed to more quickly quantify alignment parameters on a mobile device. Further development is aimed at enabling broad EOS image access for the integration of intraoperative solutions.
Implants and Fixation Systems
 Our portfolio of specialized spinal implants and fixation systems are designed to specifically meet the requirements of each approach. Available in varying shapes, sizes, and lordosis options, our spinal implants include implants made from allograft, PEEK, and porous titanium. We offer NanoTec surface modifications to our interbody systems to increase the surface area for cell adhesion and proliferation. Customization can be enhanced with our lordotic expandable intervertebral body fusion system, Calibrate PSX, which was released in 2022. We also offer several standalone implants designed to provide for height restoration and stabilization in one integrated solution.
Invictus is our next-generation comprehensive spinal fixation solution, designed to treat the range of pathologies, with intraoperative adaptability and surgical predictability through an open, minimally invasive (“MIS”), or hybrid approach. The sophistication of the Invictus Posterior Fixation System continues to expand. The commercial release of Invictus OCT in early 2021 extended the system’s proficiencies to include the occiput and cervical spine, creating a single system capable of addressing the entire spine from occiput to ilium with familiar and consistent instrument design, simplified screw insertion, and intraoperative adaptability. The launch of Invictus OsseoScrew® later in 2021 advanced the system with the first and only expandable screw commercially available in the U.S. OsseoScrew has been designed to optimize fixation and address fixation failure in compromised bone.
Biologics
 We have a variety of biologics designed to facilitate the process of spinal fusion. Our biologics offerings consist of several allograft (donated human tissue) options, including 3D ProFuse® Osteoconductive Bioscaffold, and a family of AlphaGRAFT® products. 3D ProFuse® Osteoconductive Bioscaffold is highly compressible when hydrated, allowing for ease of handling and better endplate-to-endplate contact. Our AlphaGRAFT Demineralized Bone Matrix (“DBM”) consists of demineralized human tissue that is available in gel, putty, and fiber forms. AlphaGRAFT DBM Fibers combine the regenerative capacity of interconnected fibers with the maximum availability of growth factors endogenous to bone. Composed of 100% demineralized fibers, AlphaGRAFT DBM Fibers offer moldable, cohesive handling characteristics. AlphaGRAFT Cellular Bone Matrix (“CBM”) is a growth factor-enriched cellular bone matrix (“CBM”) that exhibits the angiogenic, osteoinductive, and mitogenic growth factors necessary for bone growth. AlphaGRAFT CBM may be delivered in granular, fiber, or structural form. We also offer BioCORE® Moldable Bioactive Graft which is a synthetic mineral-collagen composite matrix that can be molded to fit the bone defect. Our Amnioshield® Amniotic Tissue Barrier is an allograft for spinal surgical barrier applications. The composite amniotic membrane is intended to act as a biological barrier and provide an excellent dissection plane.
Products and Technologies Under Development
Internally Developed Products and Technologies
 We are expanding our portfolio of products and technologies to enhance clinical outcomes across multiple pathologies, regardless of a surgeon’s preferred surgical approach. We expect to launch 8-10 new products during 2023.
Research and Development
 Our research and development team seeks to better meet the requirements of each surgical approach and design and release new products that increase our penetration of the U.S. spine market. We are focused on developing technology platforms and products that span the largest market segments addressing degenerative and deformity spine pathologies. We have transformed our development process by focusing our programs and leveraging integrated teams to reduce the time frame from product concept to market commercialization. We also collaborate with surgeon partners to design products that are intended to enhance the clinical experience, simplify surgical techniques, and reduce overall costs, while improving patient outcomes. Most of our product development efforts are fully integrated in a singular location, our Carlsbad headquarters, which allows us to bring products from concept to market rapidly responding to surgeon and patient needs. Our resources include a technology advancement cell for rapid prototyping, a cadaveric lab, and mechanical testing laboratory.
Sales and Marketing
 We market and sell our products through a sales force consisting of dedicated and non-dedicated independent sales agents and dedicated employee direct sales representatives. We employ a team of area vice presidents, sales directors, and regional business managers, who are responsible for overseeing the sales channel process in their territories. Although surgeons in the U.S. typically make the ultimate decision to use our products, we generally invoice the hospital for the products that are used and pay commissions to the sales representative, or the sales agent based on payment received from the hospital. We compensate our direct sales employees through salaries and incentive bonuses based on performance measures.
 We evaluate and select our distribution partners and sales employees based upon their expertise in selling spinal devices, reputation within the surgeon community, geographical coverage, and established sales network.
 We market our products at various industry conferences, organized surgical training courses, and in industry trade journals and periodicals.
 Surgeon Training and Education
 We focus our surgeon training efforts on delivering critical technical skills needed to perform the entire spinal fusion procedure through a peer-to-peer approach for qualified surgeon customers. Well-timed surgeon education programs drive customer conversion and loyalty by focusing on delivering value through improved clinical outcomes. We devote significant resources to training and education and are committed to a culture of scientific excellence and ethics.
 We believe that one of the most effective ways to introduce and build market demand for our products is by training and educating spine surgeons, independent sales agents, and direct sales representatives on the benefits and use of our products. Sales training programs are a platform for learning and organizational development, ensuring the sales force is clinically competitive and considered an essential resource to all stakeholders. We focus on cross-functional collaboration and alignment to deliver timely and relevant programs to meet surgeon and representative needs and positively impact the business.
 Our training and education programs are designed to support new product introductions to the market as well as ongoing portfolio advancement. Our resources are nimble and responsive and include field-based engagements to supplement our core curriculum. We believe this is an effective way to increase overall surgeon adoption of our new products.

We believe that surgeons, independent sales agents, and direct sales representatives will become exposed to the merits and distinguishing features of our products through our training and education programs, and that such exposure will increase the use and promotion of our products. With a focus on the entire procedure, we expect to build awareness of the breadth of our product offering. We are conscientious in the pursuit of delivering value to all stakeholders. Our goal is to provide surgeon education programs, coupled with a growing and comprehensive sales training platform that create a sustainable competitive advantage for our organization.
 Manufacture and Supply
 We rely on third-party suppliers for the manufacture of all our implants and instruments. Outsourcing implant manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our products. We select our suppliers to ensure that all of our products are safe, effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA, and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.
The raw materials used in the manufacture of our non-biologic products are principally titanium, titanium alloys, stainless steel, cobalt chrome, ceramic, allograft, and PEEK. With the exception of PEEK, none of our raw material requirements is limited to any significant extent by critical supply. We are subject to the risk that Invibio, one of a limited number of PEEK suppliers, will be unable to supply PEEK in adequate amounts and in a timely manner. We believe our supplier relationships, alternative product offerings, vendor-managed inventory, and quality processes will support our potential capacity needs for the foreseeable future.
With respect to biologics products, we are FDA-registered and licensed in the states of California, New York, and Florida, the only states that currently require licenses. Our facility and the facilities of the third-party suppliers we use are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. Because our biologics products are processed from human tissue, maintaining a steady supply can sometimes be challenging. We have not experienced significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements and we have not experienced a meaningful disruption to sales orders.
Competition
 Although we believe that our current broad product portfolio and development pipeline is differentiated and has numerous competitive advantages, the spinal implant industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, and significantly affected by new product introductions. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
 
•improved outcomes for spine pathology procedures
 •ease of use, quality, and reliability of product portfolio
 •effective and efficient sales, marketing, and distribution
 •quality service and an educated and knowledgeable sales network
 •technical leadership and superiority
 •surgeon services, such as training and education
 •responsiveness to the needs of surgeons
 •acceptance by spine surgeons
 •product price and qualification for reimbursement
 •speed to market
 

Both our currently marketed products and any future products we commercialize are subject to intense competition. We believe that our most significant competitors are Medtronic (Sofamor Danek), Johnson & Johnson (DePuy Spine), Stryker, NuVasive, Zimmer Biomet, Globus Medical, and others, many of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. In addition, these companies may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships with physicians and greater experience in developing, launching, marketing, distributing, and selling spinal implant products.

Some of our competitors also provide non-operative therapies for spine disorder conditions. While these non-operative treatments are considered to be an alternative to surgery, surgery is typically performed in the event that non-operative treatments are unsuccessful. We believe that, to date, these non-operative treatments have not caused a material reduction in the demand for surgical treatment of spinal disorders.
 Intellectual Property
 We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, proprietary information ownership agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We believe that in order to have a competitive advantage, we must develop, maintain, and enforce the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We require our employees, consultants, co-developers, sales agents and advisors to execute agreements governing the ownership of proprietary information and use and disclosure of confidential information in connection with their relationship with us. In general, these agreements require these individuals and entities to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions that were conceived on our behalf, or which relate to our property or business and to keep our confidential information confidential and only use such confidential information in connection with our business.
 Patents. As of December 31, 2022, we and our affiliates owned, or we exclusively owned 196 issued U.S. patents, 39 pending U.S. patent applications and 234 issued or pending foreign patents. We own multiple patents relating to unique aspects and improvements for several of our products. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is issued. We do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position.
 Trademarks. As of December 31, 2022, we and our affiliates owned 26 registered U.S. trademarks and 19 registered trademarks outside of the U.S.
 Government Regulation
 Our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other U.S. federal and state regulatory bodies and comparable authorities in other countries. Our products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and in the case of our tissue products, also under the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”). To ensure that our products are safe and effective for their intended use, the FDA regulates, among other things, the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform:
 
•product design and development;
 •product testing;
 •non-clinical and clinical research;
 •product manufacturing;
 •product labeling;
 •product storage;
 •premarket clearance or approval;
 •advertising and promotion;
 •product marketing, sales and distribution;


•import and export; and
 •post-market surveillance, including reporting deaths or serious injuries related to products and certain product malfunctions.
 Government Regulation—Medical Devices
 FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either FDA clearance of a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval of a premarket approval application, (“PMA”). The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Under the FDCA medical devices are classified into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with the use of the device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory controls deemed to be necessary by the FDA to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.
Class I devices are those with the lowest risk to the patient for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require 510(k) clearance by the FDA, though most Class I devices are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, product-specific guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by compliance with the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices must be the subject of an approved PMA. Both 510(k)s and PMAs are subject to the payment of user fees at the time of submission for FDA review.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device following submission and review of a 510(k) premarket notification, or if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk, the device sponsor may either pursue a PMA approval or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. Our current products on the market in the U.S. include Class II spinal implants and instruments marketed under 510(k) premarket clearance, as well as Class I 510(k) exempt spinal instruments and devices.
510(k) Clearance Pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device legally marketed in the U.S. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.

The FDA’s goal is to review and act on each 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but on average the process usually takes approximately six months. It may take less time depending on the type of device and it may take longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires the submission of a 510(k) or PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make enhancements to our products for which we have not submitted 510(k)s or PMAs, and we will consider on a case-by-case basis whether a new 510(k) or PMA is necessary.
 The FDA began to consider proposals to reform its 510(k) marketing clearance process in 2011, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period. Specifically, in response to industry and healthcare provider concerns regarding the predictability, consistency and rigor of the 510(k) regulatory pathway, the FDA initiated an evaluation of the 510(k) program, and as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), Congress reauthorized the Medical Device User Fee Amendments with various FDA performance goal commitments and enacted several “Medical Device Regulatory Improvements” and miscellaneous reforms, which are further intended to clarify and improve medical device regulation both pre- and post-clearance and approval. Further, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of devices and spur innovation but its ultimate implementation is unclear.
 Premarket Approval Pathway. Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trials, manufacturing, and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of the PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulation ("QSR"). The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy, and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.


Clinical Trials. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting, and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device is determined to present a “significant risk” to human health, the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an IDE application to the FDA and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by FDA, the sponsor, or an IRB at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. We are not currently undertaking any FDA IDE trials, as all of our existing products are FDA-cleared through the 510(k) pathway. It is possible, however, that future device development may require IDE clinical trial for approval.
 Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation. After a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 
•registration and listing requirements, which require manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution;
 •the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party contract manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, supplier/contractor selection, documentation, record maintenance and other quality assurance controls, during all aspects of the manufacturing process and to maintain and investigate complaints;
 •labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements;
 •advertising and promotion requirements;
 •restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of a device;
 •FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved (“off-label”) uses;
 •medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers submit reports to the FDA of device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur;
 •medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •device tracking requirements; and
 •other post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.


Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following:
 •warning letters and untitled letters;
 •fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
 •recalls, withdrawals, administrative detention, or seizure of products;
 •operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
 •withdrawals of 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
 •refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products; and/or
 •criminal prosecution.
 Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to evaluate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 Regulation of Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products. Certain of our products are regulated as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”). Section 361 of the PHSA authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as “361” HCT/Ps are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, or Good Tissue Practice, when processing, storing, labeling, and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping, and adverse event reporting, among other applicable requirements and laws. If the HCT/P is minimally manipulated, is intended for homologous use only and meets other requirements, the HCT/P will not require 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, a Biologics License Applications, or other premarket authorization from the FDA before marketing.
 Environmental Matters
 Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the handling and disposal of hazardous wastes; the cleanup of contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We could also be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury.
Compliance with Certain Applicable Statutes
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, criminal health care fraud laws, physician payment transparency laws, data privacy and security laws, and foreign corrupt practice laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws are administered by, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. For example, the definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. In addition, among other things, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as “ACA”), amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it. Furthermore, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
In implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), has issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, which began in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, in circumstances where all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have anti-kickback laws that are similar to the federal law, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, and may also result in penalties, fines, sanctions for violations, and exclusions from state or commercial programs.
We have entered into various agreements with certain surgeons that perform services for us, including some who make clinical decisions to use our products. Some of our referring surgeons own our stock, which they may have received from us as consideration for services performed. We frequently review these arrangements to determine whether they are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, physician-owned distribution companies (“PODs”) have become decreasingly involved in the sale and distribution of medical devices, including products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. In many cases, these distribution companies enter into arrangements with hospitals that bill Medicare or Medicaid for the furnishing of medical services, and the physician-owners are among the physicians who refer patients to the hospitals for surgery. On March 26, 2013, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert entitled “Physician-Owned Entities,” (the “Fraud Alert”), in which the OIG concluded, among other things, that PODs are “inherently suspect under the anti-kickback statute” and that PODs present “substantial fraud and abuse risk and pose dangers of patient safety.” Since 2013, the OIG has further increased its scrutiny of PODs and the Department of Justice has brought several high-profile cases against physician owners.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing or causing to be filed a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Private suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as qui tam actions, can be brought by individuals on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $12,537 and $25,076 for each separate false claim and may be subject to exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Various states have also enacted similar laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The ACA changed the intent requirement of the healthcare fraud statute to such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in similar sanctions.
ACA also includes various provisions designed to significantly strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement in addition to those changes discussed above. Among these additional provisions include increased funding for enforcement efforts and new “sunshine” provisions to require us to report and disclose to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), any payment or “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians or teaching hospitals. These sunshine provisions also require certain group purchasing organizations, including physician-owned distributors, to disclose physician ownership information to CMS. We and other device manufacturers are required to collect and annually report specific data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals. There are various state laws and initiatives that require device manufacturers to disclose to the appropriate regulatory agency certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, and in certain cases prohibit some forms of these payments, with the risk of fines for any violation of such requirements.
HIPAA also includes privacy and security provisions designed to regulate the use and disclosure of “protected health information” (“PHI”), which is health information that identifies a patient and that is held by a health care provider, a health plan or health care clearinghouse. We are not directly regulated by HIPAA, but our ability to access PHI for purposes such as marketing, product development, clinical research or other uses is controlled by HIPAA and restrictions placed on health care providers and other covered entities. HIPAA was amended in 2009 by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) which strengthened the rule, increased penalties for violations, and added a requirement for the disclosure of breaches to affected individuals, the government, and in some cases the media. We must carefully structure any transaction involving PHI to avoid violation of HIPAA and HITECH requirements.
Almost all states have adopted data security laws protecting personal information including social security numbers, state issued identification numbers, credit card or financial account information coupled with individuals’ names or initials. We must comply with all applicable state data security laws, even though they vary extensively, and must ensure that any breaches or accidental disclosures of personal information are promptly reported to affected individuals and responsible government entities. We must also ensure that we maintain compliant, written information security programs or run the risk of civil or even criminal sanctions for non-compliance as well as reputational harm for publicly reported breaches or violations.
If any of our operations are found to have violated or be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, among them being civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.


Third-Party Reimbursement
 In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers, and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and pay for all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which our medical devices are used. We expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will depend in large part on the continued availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors. These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not medically necessary in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Particularly in the U.S., third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products. Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies are developed by CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, and its contractors. CMS establishes these Medicare policies for medical products and procedures and such policies are periodically reviewed and updated. While private payors vary in their coverage and payment policies, the Medicare program is viewed as a benchmark. Medicare payment rates for the same or similar procedures vary due to geographic location, nature of the facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., teaching or community hospital) and other factors. We cannot provide assurance that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures in which our products are used. ACA and other reform proposals contain significant changes regarding Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payors.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken, as well as, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. An expansion in government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes, and adversely affect our business and results of operations, possibly materially.
 We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. We cannot assure that government or private third-party payors will cover and provide adequate payment for the procedures using our products. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for procedures using our products or our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 705 employees worldwide. Approximately 518 employees were located in the U.S. and 187 employees were located outside of the U.S. Of our U.S. employees, 347 were based in our Carlsbad, CA headquarters, covering all of the following functional areas: sales, customer service, marketing, clinical education, advanced manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory affairs, research and development, human resources, finance, legal, information technology, and administration.
Our workforce is highly educated and diverse, which we believe is important for our continued success as a leading innovator in the medical device market. We employ a number of strategies to best enable us to attract, retain, and engage our team members. To build a steady and diverse pipeline of talent, we have a robust recruiting program, which is focused on attracting and retaining the talent we believe is necessary to help achieve our strategy and mission. Further, we employ recruiting processes that mitigate unconscious biases and promote diverse candidate pools. Our employee base is comprised of men, women, underrepresented individuals, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans.

To attract and retain employees, we offer competitive, performance-based compensation and benefits, opportunities for discounted equity ownership, employee recognition programs, career development opportunities, and access to continual growth through in-house live trainings, as well as support and reimbursement for external trainings and educational programs. In addition, to further expand employee enrichment and engagement, we periodically survey our employees regarding their satisfaction levels. We use these survey results to determine how we can continue to create work environments that energize our employees and enable them to develop and maintain a positive working culture. We completed a survey in December 2022, in which over 90% of respondents indicated a willingness to recommend the Company to friends and family as a desirable place to work. High employee satisfaction is also reflected in our high employee engagement and low undesired turnover, which was approximately 6% for 2022.
We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. We currently have no employees working under collective bargaining agreements.
 Health and Wellness
 We offer various health and wellness programs to promote a healthy and active lifestyle for our employees. In addition to our health and wellness program offerings, our corporate headquarters includes indoor and outdoor workout spaces, which our employees are able to access throughout the day, as well as various fitness and workout classes. We have provided health and wellness initiatives throughout the year to promote the continued wellbeing of our employees, as well as opportunities for our employees to participate in community volunteer and clean-up programs to foster camaraderie within our employee base.
