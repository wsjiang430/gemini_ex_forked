Through a series of acquisitions and integrations, we have built a diverse family of software applications under the Upland brand that are delivered through seven enterprise solution suites, each of which addresses a specific enterprise work management need. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our total revenue grew from $98.0 million to $149.9 million, representing a 53% period-over-period growth rate. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our subscription and support revenue grew from $85.5 million to $136.6 million, representing a 60% period-over-period growth rate. See Note 12 Revenue Recognition, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our revenue as it relates to domestic and foreign operations.
To support continued growth, we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions within our core enterprise solution suites of complementary technologies and businesses. This will expand our customer base and market access, resulting in increased benefits of scale. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have made a total of 20 acquisitions in the 7 years ending December 31, 2018.
The operating platform that we use to transform acquired companies and maintain a consistently high level of operating performance is called UplandOne. This platform consists of six key areas:
High-Touch Customer Success Program. Customer success is a continuous journey based on open communication and establishing clear goals towards value realization and maximum customer success. To achieve this, we have institutionalized a set of unique customer commitments and deliverables we call the Upland Customer Success Program that includes onboarding and training, a dedicated customer success representative, upgraded success plans, quarterly virtual user conferences, periodic executive outreach and Net Promoter Score, or NPS, surveys, and an ongoing customer feedback loop.
Quality-Focused R&D. Our approach to R&D at Upland is straight-forward: prioritize customer need, leverage a metrics-driven agile approach with visibility and accountability, and deploy the most up-to-date development systems to ensure quality is built into every step of development.
Customer-Driven Innovation. Customer feedback is at the heart of the Upland customer experience. New features are added and prioritized in our product roadmaps, and then fine-tuned, based on direct customer input. Requests from our Premier Success Plan customers are given additional priority weighting for new features and minor issue resolution. Product feedback outlets include customer success account management, quarterly virtual user conferences, annual customer advisory boards, and Upland’s online communities.
Expert Professional Services. Through our Professional Services organization, Upland is committed to delivering the most value from a customer’s Upland investment in the shortest possible time. Once we engage on a project, we dedicate a team to the planning, configuration, integration, launch, administration and maintenance of the application. 
24x7 Global Support. Upland Global support includes: prioritized issue escalation and resolution; online and phone support, 24/7/365; access to a community to share and discuss best practices, support tips, training materials, and custom reports; a knowledge-base with alerts, service recommendations, and troubleshooting content; unlimited case submissions and real-time case updates; and full support across the globe. For customers 
5

that have more urgent support requirements, Upland Premier Success Plans provide enhanced response times and availability for the most severe support requests.
Enterprise Cloud Platform. Upland’s products run on an enterprise-class cloud environment - delivering power, reliability, and flexibility. We utilize Amazon Web Services, or AWS, for all our cloud-based products and move acquired products to AWS in connection with our acquisition integration program. Upland’s cloud technology gives customers the freedom from legacy applications without having to compromise security or scalability. Our applications are scalable and can support large deployments while maintaining required performance levels.
Our operating results in a given period can fluctuate based on the mix of subscription and support, perpetual license, and professional services revenue. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our subscription and support revenue accounted for 91%, 87% and 88% of total revenue, respectively. Historically, we have sold certain of our applications under perpetual licenses, which also are paid in advance. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our perpetual license revenue accounted for 3%, 4% and 2%of total revenue, respectively. The support agreements related to our perpetual licenses are typically one-year in duration and entitle the customer to support and unspecified upgrades. The revenue related to such support agreements is included as part of our subscription and support revenue. Professional services revenue consists of fees related to implementation, data extraction, integration and configuration, and training on our applications. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our professional services revenue accounted for 6%, 9% and 10% of total revenue, respectively. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths are keys to our success:

• | Large, diversified customer base. Our customer base is highly diverse and spans a broad array of industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, legal, education, consumer goods, media, telecommunications, government, non-profit, food and beverage, healthcare and life sciences. We service customers of varying size, ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to small- and medium-sized businesses. We have over 9,000 customers, with no customer accounting for more than 3% of our revenue.


• | Diversified family of software solutions. We offer a family of cloud-based enterprise work management software solutions that addresses a broad range of enterprise needs. We believe this benefits our customers as compared to many of our cloud-based competitors who offer only a single point solution for a more limited and discrete need.


• | Recurring revenue model with high visibility. We believe we have an attractive operating model due to the recurring nature of our subscription revenue, which results in greater visibility and predictability of future revenue and enhances our ability to effectively manage our business. In addition, the cloud-based nature of our model accommodates significant additional business volume with limited incremental costs, providing us with opportunities to improve our operating margins.


• | Proven M&A capability. We have a proven ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses to grow our company, as evidenced by the 20 acquisitions we have completed since the beginning of 2012. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy give us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our family of software applications to better serve our customers.


• | Experienced, proven management team. Our management team has significant operating experience and previously occupied key leadership roles at both private and public companies. In addition, our management’s extensive knowledge of the industry and experience in building businesses has enabled us to quickly establish a leading position within the enterprise software market.


• | Cloud-based delivery. We deliver our software applications and functionality primarily through the cloud, with no hardware or software installation required by our customers. This delivery model allows us to provide reliable, cost-effective applications to our customers, add subscribers with minimal incremental effort and deploy new functionality and upgrades quickly and efficiently. We

6

believe our cloud-based delivery model provides us with a competitive advantage over legacy processes and on-premise systems.

• | Commitment to customer success. We have a dedicated customer success organization whose mission is to drive adoption, value realization, retention, and loyalty across our customer base. Our focus on enabling our customers’ success is a key reason our annual net dollar retention rate, as defined in “Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis” herein, was 98% as of December 31, 2018. Our commitment to customer success has enabled us to expand our footprint within customer organizations and facilitate the ongoing adoption of our enterprise software applications. We utilize NPS methodology to track our progress and drive continuous improvement.

Our Strategy for Growth
We believe the key elements of our strategy for growth are as follows: 

• | Acquire complementary software businesses. We intend to pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, products, and businesses to expand our product families and customer base, and to provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. Our experienced corporate development team continually monitors a pipeline of potential acquisition candidates, many of which are smaller in scale or address only limited enterprise challenges, which often operate outside the scope of some of our larger competitors. We believe that our acquisition experience and strategy give us a competitive advantage in identifying additional opportunities to expand our family of cloud-based applications to better serve our customers. We intend to prioritize acquisitions within the solution categories we currently offer.


• | Increase sales to existing customers. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the adoption of our applications within our existing customer organizations, particularly within divisions or departments that have not previously used our applications. We also intend to cross-sell additional applications to our existing customers, as very few of our customers currently use more than one of our applications. In addition, we intend to add new applications to our family of applications that will address additional functions within the enterprise spectrum. We believe these initiatives will significantly increase the value of our platform to our customers, further strengthen our competitive position, and drive increased adoption of multiple applications by our customers.


• | Add new customers. We maintain direct sales and marketing capabilities to further grow our customer base. We also maintain indirect sales channels through alliances with strategic partners that can leverage our applications with their complementary services and technologies. In addition, we continue to expand the range of integrations between our software and third-party applications and platforms, which we believe make our applications more attractive to a broader audience of potential customers.


• | Expand globally. We believe there is an opportunity to grow sales of our applications globally. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 22%, 18%, and 16%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from sales outside the United States. Over the next several years, we plan to continue to evaluate growth opportunities outside the United States through selective acquisitions, the hiring of additional sales personnel, and entering into strategic partnerships.


• | Improve and enhance applications. We intend to continue to invest in research and development and work closely with our customers to identify and improve new applications, features and functionalities that address customer requirements across the enterprise spectrum. We also intend to continue to expand the breadth of our applications with additional analytics, third-party integrations, and social and mobile capabilities to meet the evolving needs of today’s knowledge workers.

Customers
We service customers ranging from large global corporations and government agencies to small- and medium-sized businesses. Our customers operate in a wide variety of industries, including financial services, retail, technology, manufacturing, legal, education, consumer goods, media, telecommunications, government, 
7

non-profit, food and beverage, healthcare and life sciences, chemicals, and travel and hospitality. For the year ended December 31, 2018 approximately 80% of our recurring revenue was generated from what we consider to be major accounts, those customers with contracted annual recurring revenue of $25,000 or more. No customer represented more than 3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Sales
We sell primarily through a direct sales organization comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel. In addition to our direct sales organization, we have an indirect sales organization that sells to distributors and value-added resellers. We employ a land-and-expand go-to-market strategy. After we demonstrate the value of an initial application to a customer, our sales and account management teams work to expand the adoption of that initial application across the customer, and cross-sell additional applications to address other enterprise work management needs of the customer. Our customer success organization supports our direct sales efforts by managing the post-sale customer lifecycle.
Our subscription agreements are typically sold either on a per-seat basis or on a minimum contracted volume basis with overage fees billed in arrears, depending on the application being sold. Contract terms typically range from one to three years and are prepaid annually in advance. 
Marketing
Our marketing activities are designed to build awareness of the Upland brand and the solutions we offer, generate thought leadership, and create demand, resulting in leads and opportunities for our sales organizations. We focus a significant portion of our marketing activities on our existing installed base of customers to drive expansion and cross-sell opportunities. Our marketing programs target decision makers and influencers who participate in a buying cycle, including the chief information officer, the chief marketing officer, the chief financial officer, the director of process excellence, and other key technology and business managers. Our principal marketing programs include:

• | use of our website to provide information about us and our software applications, as well as educational opportunities for potential customers;


• | field marketing events for customers and prospective customers;


• | participation in, and sponsorship of, executive events, trade shows, and industry events;


• | our online virtual user conferences;


• | integrated digital marketing campaigns, including email, online advertising, blogs, and webinars;


• | public relations, analyst relations, and social media initiatives; and


• | sales representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities.

Customer Success
Our customer success organization is structured to manage all aspects of our post-sale customer lifecycle. This organization consists of dedicated teams with a mission to drive adoption of our products, value realization, retention, and loyalty across our customer base. Our customer success organization has four core functional areas with strategic focus on customer relationship management:

• | Customer Care. Our customer care team assists customers throughout their lifecycle with the Upland family of applications by making service offerings available to all customers as part of their standard customer agreements, including webinars, virtual user conferences, and online community engagement.


• | Professional Services. Our professional services team is responsible for coordinating all activities relating to the implementation, transition, and on-boarding of new customers and assisting new customers with the addition of new applications to their accounts. Typical professional services engagements vary in length from a few weeks to several months depending on the size and scope of the engagement and are in addition to services provided under our standard customer agreement and are fee-

8

based. In addition, our project managers and consultants work closely with our customers to provide services that help customers maximize the utility of our applications.

• | Account Management. We assign each customer an account team with a relationship manager who functions as the customer’s single point of contact and advocate within Upland. Our account management teams are trained on all of our applications and work closely with the relationship manager to ensure that our customers receive high-quality consultative service.


• | Customer Support. We offer support from all of our office locations to help our customers maximize the return on their investment in our applications. We provide 24/7/365 customer support around the world through our online customer support portal. In addition, our customer support team manages and administers the Upland customer community forum and knowledge base repository.

Our customer success organization manages programs to reinforce the ongoing business value of our applications. These service offerings include:

• | Health Checks and Program Reviews where we engage core users and business buyer sponsors to deliver a detailed scorecard and recommendation report.


• | Advisory and Retained Services that provide our customers with access to a specific customer success contact with priority scheduling and periodic checkpoints.


• | System Deployment and Adoption Analysis programs to analyze system configuration and usage patterns, resulting in best practice recommendations on improving user adoption and compliance.


• | Consumption Review and Recommendations designed to deliver best practice recommendations for implementation strategy and a roadmap proposal for aligning the system with customers’ evolving process maturity to increase application usage.


• | Premier Success Plans that provide a bundled services, support, and product experience offering with three tiers (standard, gold and platinum) designed to provide maximum customer value.


• | Executive Outreach where we promote open communication between the Upland leadership team, which is fully committed to making sure customers are delighted with their Upland experience, and customer executives.

Technology and Operations
Our cloud-based family of applications utilizes a multi-tenant architecture and our customers access our applications using a secure Internet connection through a standard web browser. Our applications are easy to deploy, highly configurable, scalable, flexible, and secure, and provide our customers with a modern and intuitive user experience.
We have partnered with AWS to provide the hardware and infrastructure necessary to provide our services to our customers. AWS facilities provide 24/7/365 security, biometric access controls, redundant networking, power and environmental systems, and monitoring. Upland Software designs and operates the infrastructure architecture with fully redundant subsystems, highly available configurations, and defense in depth security zones.
Our applications are built on highly available and modular architectures that balance customer workloads across multiple servers. This allows us to provide a flexible method for scaling customers without impacting other parts of the architectural environment while maintaining the high levels of uptime our customers require.
Our family of applications offers high levels of security through logical data segregation of each customer’s data from the data of other customers and through limiting access to our platform to only those individuals authorized by our customers. In addition, sensitive customer data is encrypted “at rest” and “in transit” over secure connections to redundant storage in a secondary location.
We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to help preserve the security and integrity of customer data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to data.

Competition
The overall markets we serve are rapidly evolving and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new applications. The intensity and nature of our competition varies significantly across our range of enterprise applications. We compete against larger enterprise software companies that provide a full suite of Software as a Service, or SaaS, solutions focused on the functional areas we serve or the problems our solutions address. We face competition both from point solution providers, including legacy on-premise enterprise systems, and other cloud-based software vendors that may address one or more of the functional elements of our applications. In addition, we face competition from manual processes and traditional tools, such as paper-based procedures, spreadsheets, and email.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:

• | breadth and depth of application functionality;


• | ease of deployment and use of applications;


• | total cost of ownership;


• | levels of customer support satisfaction;


• | brand awareness and reputation;


• | capability for configurability, integration, scalability, and reliability of applications;


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly; and


• | level of integration among applications and with other enterprise systems.

We believe that we compete favorably on these factors. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on the strength of our applications, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, the quality of our customer success organization, and our ability to acquire complementary technologies, products, and businesses to enhance the features and functionality of our applications.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. 
Backlog
Backlog represents future billings under our non-cancelable agreements that have not been invoiced or paid and; accordingly, not recorded in deferred revenue. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced or paid, they are not recorded in revenues, deferred revenue or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018 our backlog was approximately $65.7 million.
Our subscription contracts are generally 1 to 3 years in length, and therefore the substantial majority of our backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue within the one-year contract term. Revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue, backlog under contracts in existence at the beginning of the period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period. As a result, our backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of our future performance. Our presentation of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 667 employees, with the majority of our employees located in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
