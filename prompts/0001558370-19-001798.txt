 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing novel artificial intelligence-based approaches to identify the next wave of medicines across neuroscience and immuno-oncology. Our drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indices. 
 We believe that this differentiated approach has the potential to reduce the cost and time of drug development in diseases with substantial unmet medical need. Our two most advanced clinical development programs are BXCL501, a sublingual thin film formulation of the α2a adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine, or Dex, for acute treatment of agitation resulting from neurological and psychiatric disorders, and BXCL701, an immuno‑oncology agent for treatment of a rare form of prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. 
 We intend to develop first‑in‑class, high value therapeutics by leveraging EvolverAI, a research and development engine created and owned by our parent, BioXcel Corporation, or BioXcel. We believe the combination of our therapeutic area expertise and our ability to generate product candidates through our exclusive collaborative relationship with BioXcel in the areas of neuroscience and immuno‑oncology gives us a significant competitive advantage. EvolverAI was developed over the last decade and integrates millions of fragmented data points using artificial intelligence, or AI and proprietary machine learning algorithms. After evaluating multiple product candidates using EvolverAI, we selected our lead programs because our analysis indicated these drugs may have utility in new therapeutic indices where there is substantial unmet medical needs and limited competition. By focusing on clinical candidates with relevant human data, we believe our approach will help us design more efficient clinical trials, thereby accelerating our product candidates’ time to market. We retain global development and commercialization rights to these two programs.

Our Clinical Programs
 The following table summarizes our lead development programs:
    
     Our Strategy 
 Our goal is to become a leader in the field of neuroscience and immuno‑oncology. The key elements to achieving this goal are to:

· | Advance BXCL501, a sublingual thin film formulation of Dex, a selective α2a adrenergic receptor agonist, designed for acute treatment of agitation, to approval through an FDA Section 505(b)(2) pathway.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders. We believe that BXCL501 has the potential to become the standard of care for the acute treatment of agitation arising from diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, senile dementia (Alzheimer’s type), and other indications. Dex has been shown to significantly reduce agitation in elderly patients experiencing post surgical anesthetic‑induced delirium who did not respond to treatment with haloperidol, a potent antipsychotic that is used to treat symptoms for schizophrenia. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additional Indications. We may plan to expand into additional indications for acute treatment of agitation resulting from delirium, alcohol or opioid withdrawal, and post‑traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, as well as explore the use of BXCL501 in patients who are claustrophobic and anxious awaiting an MRI or other out-patient medical procedures. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Advance BXCL701 into Phase 2 trials to assess its potential to be the first approved therapy for treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer, or tNEPC, and for the second line treatment of pancreatic cancer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | tNEPC (Orphan Segment of Prostate Cancer). BXCL701 was previously studied in multiple clinical trials and demonstrated single agent anti‑tumor activity in melanoma, an 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

immuno‑sensitive tumor. We believe the existing preclinical and clinical data for BXCL701 may significantly reduce our development time for this compound. The FDA accepted our IND proposal to test BXCL701 in tNEPC, and the trial opened to accrual in February 2019.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Pancreatic Cancer. Data indicates that fibroblast activation protein positive, or FAP contribute to checkpoint inhibitor resistance, and immunosuppression more generally in pancreatic cancer. We believe this provides a strong rationale for combining BXCL701 with a checkpoint inhibitor avelumab (Bavencio) or nivolumab (Opdivo). Furthermore we have shown strong synergy between BXCL 701 checkpoint inhibition and NKTR 214, a CD122 based agonist of IL2, in a pancreatic preclinical model. BXCL701 has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We believe the existing clinical and preclinical data for BXCL701 in pancreatic cancer may reduce our development time for this compound. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potential for Accelerated Clinical and Regulatory Approval. Given that both indications represent high unmet medical needs with few treatment options, we intend to pursue breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval pathways for both indications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Additional Indications. We believe BXCL701 is active at multiple stages of the cancer immunity cycle and therefore we believe BXCL701 offers a “pipeline in a product” platform given its potential application across other solid tumor types. Existing preclinical and clinical evidence support the combination of BXCL701 with checkpoint inhibitors and/or agents that act on “co-stimulatory” pathways within immune effector cells. Moreover, agents that stimulate antibody‑dependent cell‑mediated cytotoxicity, (ADCC) or cell-based therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T‑cell (CAR‑T) therapy, oncolytic viruses or therapeutic vaccines all represent potential combination with BXCL701. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Identify biomarkers to select patients who have the highest likelihood to respond to our product candidates. Predicting optimal drug responses in patients requires the identification and validation of predictive biomarkers. We believe that our ability to identify patient subsets most likely to respond to our product candidates will increase the clinical benefit to patients and improve the probability of success of our clinical trials. The indications for our lead product candidate BXCL701 were chosen in part because they are known to overexpress dipeptidyl peptidase or DPP 8/9 and Fibroblast Activation Protein or FAP. Our planned PoC clinical trial of BXCL701 will examine biomarkers retrospectively related to its molecular and cellular targets to identify those that may correlate with clinical efficacy and increase our likelihood of success. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhance our R&D pipeline by leveraging our therapeutic area expertise with EvolverAI to identify, develop and commercialize new product candidates in neuroscience and immuno‑oncology. In addition to our leading clinical programs and our emerging and future pipeline, we intend to select our next clinical program during 2019. We have established translational and development expertise, which we believe will help us advance the present and future product candidates in these fields. We may also opportunistically in‑license additional product candidates identified through our AI platform approach within our core areas of expertise. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to our BXCL501, BXCL701, BXCL502 and BXCL702 product candidates. If BXCL501 and BXCL701 are approved in the United States, we would consider building a specialty sales force in the United States and/or collaborate with third parties to maximize the potential of our product candidates. Furthermore, we intend to commercialize BXCL501 and BXCL701 outside the United States through collaborations with third parties.

 Our Novel Drug Re-Innovation Approach
 Our AI‑based discovery and development process is the foundation of our drug re‑innovation model for identifying the next wave of medicines. Our therapeutic area experts have over 60 years of experience across the drug discovery and development value chain. We believe EvolverAI is a novel method of finding potential product candidates because it combines the comprehensiveness and efficiency of machine learning and big data analytics with the expertise and intuition of human experience in drug development. We believe the combination of our therapeutic area expertise and our ability to generate therapeutic candidates in neuroscience and immuno‑oncology through our exclusive collaborative relationship in those areas with BioXcel give us a significant competitive advantage.
 The pharmacological space spans more than 27,000 active pharmaceutical agents and only approximately 4,000 are approved and marketed drugs benefiting patients. These marketed drugs may be applied to other indications, including rare diseases, and represent an untapped potential for meeting significant unmet medical need and recoupment of research and development investments. A large number of the remaining agents are clinical candidates that are active, shelved or have failed for reasons other than toxicity and can potentially be re‑engineered for different indications or patient segments. They potentially represent an unrealized investment of billions of research and development dollars by the private and public sectors, resulting in an immeasurable amount of patient suffering and sacrificing during clinical development.
 Traditional drug development is plagued with low success rates (11.3%, according to Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development White Paper, 2015), long drug development cycles (10‑15 years, according to PhRMA Key Facts 2016) and exorbitant development costs ($2.6 billion per drug, according to PhRMA Key Facts 2016). Furthermore, many serious diseases continue to go unaddressed due to limitations of the current drug discovery paradigm. The recent advent of numerous ‘omics’ technologies (genomics, proteomics) and rapid advances in science and medicine are generating terabytes of valuable unexploited knowledge that is widely distributed in multiple big data lakes with several orders of complexity and variety. Much of this data is not being systematically applied to the development of next‑generation therapeutics, thus preventing the optimization of drug development utilizing the understanding of technology, science, medicine, markets and commercial opportunities. The efficient and intuitive use of big data remains a bottleneck and a challenge to the pharmaceutical industry. Taken together, these factors underscore the need for fundamental new approaches to drug discovery and development. The market opportunity to identify new uses for existing pharmacological agents remains substantial, due to the lack of technology‑driven insights. Our parent, BioXcel, has created a proprietary R&D engine, EvolverAI, for drug re‑innovation that provides a proprietary systems‑based approach designed to unlock the hidden value in drugs. The combination of our therapeutic area expertise and our exclusive collaborative relationship with BioXcel enables us to screen, analyze, and identify the product candidates that we believe have a high likelihood of benefiting patients. The compounds in our pipeline have been identified using this proprietary platform.
 EvolverAI is designed to eliminate human bias by scanning millions of data points from disparate data sources to create network maps. The nodes and connections in the network map are weighted and ranked based on the validity of supporting evidence using disease specific algorithms. They are then further analyzed using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches supplemented by human domain‑based expertise to uncover novel connections between disease parameters, molecular targets, mechanisms of actions and product candidates.
 This drug re‑innovation model is exemplified by the successful development and commercialization of drugs such as Tecfidera (Biogen, Inc.), Thalomid (Celgene Corporation) and Viagra (Pfizer, Inc.). All of these drugs were identified by insights in biology and disease pathophysiology. The successful business models of biotech companies like Puma Biotechnology, Inc. and Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are based on the re‑innovation of existing clinical candidates or marketed drugs to provide novel solutions for patients. Unfortunately, such discoveries have been severely limited in scope due to the lack of a genuinely integrated big data analytics based approach.
 We believe that only EvolverAI allows a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of the complete pharmacological space. Our drug portfolio was identified using EvolverAI and the lead programs were chosen among more than 20 compounds selected using this approach. We believe our drug re‑innovation model and exclusive collaborative relationship with BioXcel has the potential to reduce the cost and time of drug development, help us design more

efficient trials and accelerate our product candidates time to market. This assumption is based on capitalizing product candidates with substantial clinical data and mitigated risk due to well‑defined safety profiles, known PK/PD properties, and an established manufacturing and regulatory path. Our approach is illustrated below:
    
 BXCL501, Potential First‑in‑Class Sublingual Thin Film, α2a Adrenergic Receptor Agonist, for Acute Treatment of Agitation
 Overview
 BXCL501 is a potential first in class sublingual thin film formulation of Dex designed for acute treatment of agitation in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Dex has been well tolerated, having been prescribed to millions of patients as the sedative and anesthetic Precedex and has been studied in over 130 clinical trials. BXCL501 is designed to be a non invasive, easy to administer agent that has a rapid onset of action, which is critical for the acute treatment of agitation. We estimate that over 500,000 patients who suffer from agitation associated with senile dementia Alzheimer’s type (SDAT) in the United States annually could be eligible for the acute treatment of agitation with BXCL501. In schizophrenia and bipolar disease, we estimate that over 600,000 patients in the United States annually could be eligible for the acute treatment of agitation with BXCL501. The current treatment options for acute treatment of agitation utilize antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, which have suboptimal safety and compliance issues. Antipsychotics have a black box warning for use in the elderly and can produce debilitating side effects when given acutely, and should only be considered for invasive intramuscular, or IM, delivery in highly aggressive patients requiring restraint. Benzodiazepines are predominantly in pill form, which require swallowing and can produce excessive sedation. We have designed a clinical development program that takes advantage of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s, or FDA, Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and leverages the existing clinical and safety dataset of intravenous, or IV, formulation of Dex.

 Agitation Overview and Market Opportunity
 Agitation is a common symptom of neurological and psychiatric disorders that currently can only be addressed with invasive treatments in institutional facilities. Agitation is characterized by feelings of unease, excessive talking and/or unintentional and purposeless motions, such as wringing of the hands or pacing. People experiencing agitation may also express excitement, hostility, poor impulse control, tension, uncooperativeness and sometimes disruptive behavior, which could lead to aggression and violence. Often symptoms of agitation are observed with anxiety or aggressive behavior. In many cases, people develop agitation when treatment for their underlying disorder is not working well. Stressful situations or traumatic events can also trigger agitation. Agitation can occur suddenly or slowly and vary in length, lasting for a few minutes or for an extended period of time.
 With the agitation issues associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disease coupled with a fast‑growing elderly population, the difficulties and expenses of acute treatment of agitation are expected to grow significantly. Based on our market research, we estimate that in 2016 the total direct financial cost of all aspects of care for agitation in AD was approximately $40 billion. Management believes that in the near future, the total direct financial cost of all aspects of care for agitation across schizophrenia and bipolar disorder will exceed the costs associated with agitation in AD. Below are estimated statistics associated with BTI’s initial indications targeting agitation in AD, schizophrenia and bipolar disease.
    
U.S. Market for Treating Agitation 
 | Alzheimer’s Disease | Schizophrenia/Bipolar Disease
Total Patient Population | 5,100,000 | 8,000,000 
Diagnosed Agitated Patients | ~1,000,000 (30%) | ~4,000,000 (50%) 
Agitated Patients Receiving Treatment | ~525,000 (35%) | ~2,000,000 (20%) 
Percent treatable by BXCL 501 | 100% | 33%

Estimated Annual Usage per Patient | 24 | 12 
Potential Addressable Annual Usage | 12,840,000 | 7,920,000 

      Limitations of Current Treatments for Agitation
     Despite observed suboptimal safety and side effect profile, antipsychotics are currently used off‑label to treat agitation in dementia as well as delirium and are currently the standard of care for the acute treatment of agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disease. IM delivered antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and risperidone, are used extensively in this setting but are invasive and require patient restraint. Furthermore, these treatments include a black box warning for use in elderly patients. While sublingual tablet formulations utilizing antipsychotics have been developed, these sublingual formulations have long half‑lives (21‑24 hours) and significant side effects when given either acutely or chronically. Oral agents such as benzodiazepines are also used but have a slower onset of action and are consequently not effective in the acute treatment of agitation. Side effects of these agents include sedation, amnesia, confusion and a paradoxical response. They can intensify cognitive slowing, cause dependence and can contribute to increased risk of falls and fractures. In addition, long‑term use of benzodiazepines has been found to be habit‑forming and can cause addiction. Non‑adherence with oral agents can also be problematic as patients may attempt to spit out these medications. We believe that based on the current method of administration of oral medicine for agitation, the sublingual thin film offers compliance advantages as it will prevent patients from avoiding treatment.
 There is precedent for FDA approval of a non‑invasive therapy for the acute treatment of agitation. In 2012, Adasuve, an inhaled version of the antipsychotic loxapine, became the first approved non‑invasive acute treatment for agitation in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disease. The number of hospitals and pharmacies that can administer Adasuve is limited due to a risk of management program, and Adasuve also has a high incidence of side effects. Upon launch, Adasuve was priced at $145 per dose.
 The sublingual route of administration is becoming an accepted alternative to oral administration of drug delivery to the central nervous system, or CNS when rapid onset or more controlled delivery is required. Currently, there are six products that are approved for sublingual thin film administration. For example, Cynapsus Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired

by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), is a specialty CNS pharmaceutical company that developed a fast‑acting, easy‑to‑use, apomorphine sublingual thin film for the on‑demand management of debilitating episodes of tremor associated with Parkinson’s Disease. We are in the process of developing a differentiated sublingual thin film dosage form of Dex, which, if approved, may offer benefits such as ease of use and quick absorption for rapid therapeutic effects.
     Mechanism of Action: α2a Adrenergic Receptor and NE Role in Acute Agitation
 BXCL501, a sublingual thin film formulation of the sedative and anesthetic agent Dex, is designed to be easily administered and has a rapid onset of action. We believe that BXCL501, with its differentiated pharmacology and ease of administration, if approved, could potentially be a first‑in‑class, non‑invasive acute treatment for agitation that can be rapidly administered by physicians and caregivers. Dex is approved in the United States for the sedation of initially intubated and mechanically ventilated patients during treatment in the Intensive Care Unit, or ICU. It is also used in the intensive care setting for sedation of non‑intubated patients prior to and/or during surgical and other invasive procedures. Dex, launched in the United States as Precedex in 1999, is a selective α2a adrenergic receptor agonist that has a strong safety record and has been studied in over 130 clinical trials to date. It has also been launched in the European Union and multiple other countries under the trade name Dexdor as a sedative for intensive care patients. Dex gained approval by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for sedation of adult ICU patients (requiring a sedation level no deeper than arousal in response to verbal stimulation). It has been used to prevent or treat hyperactive delirium resulting from anesthesia in the ICU. Given these uses of the IV formulation of Dex, we believe Dex formulated in a sublingual thin film will allow for ease of administration in settings where rapid acute treatment of agitation is needed. Phase 1 IV Dexmedetomidine Studies  
 Throughout 2018 we completed four trials and announced the results from several proof-of-concept Phase 1 studies of intravenous, or IV, Dex for acute treatment of agitation. The initial study in healthy middle-aged and elderly participants enrolled 16 healthy volunteers aged 55-75. The primary endpoint of the study was the dose and drug exposure levels required to produce mild sedation, which served as a surrogate endpoint for treating agitation using the Richmond Agitation- Sedation Scale, or RASS, score. 
 The goal of the healthy volunteer study which was met was to achieve mild sedation without any clinically meaningful cardiovascular side effects. The IV formulation of Dex achieved mild sedation or a RASS score of -1 in patients at a Dex exposure level without producing any clinically meaningful effects on blood pressure and/or heart rate.     This effect was evident in eleven (11) out of twelve (12) subjects on the IV formulation of Dex and occurred within thirty minutes of starting the dose which produced the desired effect. In contrast, a mild sedating effect was seen in only 1 out of 4 individuals on placebo. The mild sedative effects of the IV formulation of Dex persisted for ninety to one hundred and twenty minutes, a clinically relevant duration. The study also found that the IV formulation of Dex was well tolerated and the results supported further clinical evaluation of dexmedetomidine in acute treatment of agitation resulting from neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and Senile Dementia of the Alzheimer’s Type, or SDAT.
 Following the study in healthy middle-aged and elderly participants we announced positive results from a Phase 1b study evaluating the IV formulation of Dex for acute treatment of agitation in patients suffering from schizophrenia. The trial met its primary endpoint by identifying a safe dose of IV Dex that produced a mild arousable sedation, defined by a RASS score of -1. The study enrolled a total of fourteen (14) patients. Ten (10) patients in the treatment arm received IV Dex therapy, while four (4) patients received placebo. Dose escalation was performed by infusing 0.2 to 0.6 mcg/kg/hr of the IV formulation of Dex over a period of thirty minutes. The dose range in this study was consistent with the range used in the healthy volunteer study.
 The study demonstrated that nine out of ten patients in the treatment arm achieved a RASS score of -1, while no patients in the placebo arm experienced meaningful sedation. Additionally, the drug was well tolerated without any clinically adverse effects on blood pressure and/or heart rate. As a secondary endpoint, nine out of ten patients in the treatment arm had agitation reduced to a minimum as measured by a PEC score of 7 or below (“PEC” Positive and

Negative Symptom Scale - Excitatory Component is a five item scale that measures symptoms of agitation with each item rated from 1 Absent to 7 Extreme) in contrast with 0 out of 4 of the placebo patients.
 We announced positive results from our Phase 1b study evaluating the IV formulation of Dex for acute treatment of agitation in patients suffering from SDAT on January 2, 2019. 
 The SDAT trial met its primary endpoint by identifying a safe dose of IV Dex that produced a mild arousable sedation, defined by a RASS of -1.  This study enrolled a total of fourteen SDAT patients. Ten patients in the treatment arm received IV Dex therapy, while four patients received placebo. In accordance with study designs used in previous participant populations, Dex treatment was begun at 0.1 mcg/kg/h and dose escalation occurred every thirty minutes by increasing the infusion rate by 0.1 mcg/kg/h to a maximum infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg/h. Such dosing allowed for the efficient determination of the optimal dose in each participant. The study demonstrated that seven out of ten patients in the treatment arm achieved arousable sedation (RASS score of -1), versus only 1 of 4 patients in the placebo arm.  The drug was well tolerated without any clinically significant adverse events.
 Data from the SDAT study, and the previously completed Phase 1 studies of IV Dex in agitated patients with schizophrenia and healthy elderly volunteers is currently being used to determine the optimal dose of BXCL501, a sublingual thin film formulation of Dex. 
 Investigational New Drug approval and Fast Track Approval designation
 In December 2018, the FDA accepted our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for BXCL501 in a first-in-human pharmacokinetic (bioavailability) and safety study in healthy volunteers. 
 Follow the IND acceptance, on December 27, 2018, we announced that the FDA had granted us Fast Track Designation for BXCL501. 
 FDA’s Fast Track program is designed to provide certain benefits for new drugs that treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The designation provides the opportunity for more frequent meetings with the FDA over the course of development and allows for the potential of rolling submission of individual sections of a New Drug Application for review. If supported by clinical data, this designation allows for the potential of priority review. BXCL 501 Clinical Trials
     With the FDA acceptance of our IND for BXCL501 we dosed multiple patient cohorts in our Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (bioavailability) and safety study of BXCL501, using our proprietary sublingual thin-film formulation of Dex. 
 The IND-opening Phase 1 study is a placebo-controlled, single dose, dose-escalation study of BXCL501 that is expected to enroll up to 60 healthy adult volunteers across various dosing groups. The primary endpoints are pharmacokinetics and safety, with secondary endpoints including assessment of pharmacodynamics (PD) and the relationship between BXCL501 concentrations and PD endpoints. The Company expects to report top-line data from the study in the first half of 2019 which it anticipates will provide a path for BTI to launch the anticipated registration studies. We expect to complete dosing of these patients during the first quarter of 2019. If this trial is successful, it could potentially lead to the start of a registration trial in the second half of 2019.
 The planned Phase 3 registration trials using BXCL501 for acute treatment of agitation in AD, schizophrenia and bipolar disease will utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. We anticipate that these studies will consist of multicenter, randomized, double‑blind, placebo controlled parallel‑group studies with a few hundred patients for each of the indications. For the schizophrenia and bipolar registration trials, we expect the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale – Excitatory Scale – Excitatory Component, or PEC Score will be used to assess efficacy. The PEC Score can capture the change in levels of agitation as the primary endpoint as well measure other psychiatric secondary endpoints. All studies will be designed to be conducted in either a hospital or psychiatric in‑patient unit.

 Treatment of agitation remains a significant global healthcare challenge in patients with drug and alcohol withdrawal, delirium and post-traumatic stress disorder, as the currently available treatment options are suboptimal, invasive, difficult to administer and often pose safety issues.
 Manufacturing
 We have successfully completed Good Manufacturing Practices, GMP, manufacturing and delivery of BXCL501 drug product – sublingual thin films ranging from 10 micrograms to 60 micrograms – for clinical investigation.

Other Neuropsychiatric /Neurodegenerative Indications
 Given the differentiated properties of BXCL501 and its selective mechanism of action, we believe that BXCL501 has the potential for broad applicability across several indications where agitation is a symptom of a condition or underlying disease. Schizophrenia/bipolar were chosen as our lead indications. Dementia was chosen based on high unmet medical need and lack of a safe and well-tolerated standard of care for acute treatment of agitation in elderly patients suffering from AD. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were also chosen because of the high incidence of agitation in the emergency room and psychiatric outpatient setting resulting from agitation due to residual psychosis or hypo/mania and the need for a noninvasive rapidly acting agent in this setting. There are additional neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as medical conditions where agitation is a symptom that requires treatment. If we observe positive efficacy results in dementia and schizophrenia patients, we believe this will provide further proof of concept that BXCL501 has therapeutic potential in other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders where agitation is a disruptive symptom for patients and caregivers.
 A brief description of potential indications that we could pursue in the future with BXCL501 is summarized below. We will determine the timing and prioritization of additional indications as warranted by emerging data.

· | Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome. The burden of treating the current ongoing epidemic of heroin and opiate dependence remains a major priority for federal and state public health services and private healthcare industry. Opioid withdrawal is characterized by physiological symptoms of activation of various bodily functions clinically measured using opioid withdrawal symptom scales (e.g. the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale or COWS). Currently preferred options for treatment of acute opioid withdrawal include Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) which substitute opiates with lesser abuse potential drugs such as methadone or buprenorphine. Recently lofexidine (Lucemyra ®), with a similar MOA to Dex, was approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with acute opioid withdrawal. We believe Dex may similarly treat symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal similar MOA by reducing withdrawal symptoms which could be tested in a PoC trial with the IV formulation of Dex in treating acute opioid withdrawal symptoms. We believe that the intrinsic properties of Dex delivered via BXCL501 could provide advantages to patients, providers and payers in efficacy, flexible dosing and treatment management over other currently available non-opioid interventions for acute opioid withdrawal for individuals suffering from opioid use disorder.

· | In order to further investigate the use of Dex for the treatment of symptoms associated with Opioid withdrawal, a Phase 1b study of IV Dex in patients suffering from opioid withdrawal symptoms was announced in February 2019.. The positive data from this Phase 1b trial provides evidence to expand the potential market for BXCL501, beyond the company’s current focus for acute treatment of agitation in neuropsychiatric indications. The study further confirms that BXCL501’s selective alpha-2a adrenergic receptor mechanism has potential application in opioid withdrawal symptoms, in addition to the acute treatment of agitation in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and dementia. Opioid addiction is difficult to overcome largely because of the severe symptoms associated with withdrawal, an area in need of more effective non-opioid treatment options. BTI conducted the clinical study in a total of 15 patients with opioid dependence. Ten subjects were enrolled in the treatment arm while five subjects were enrolled in the placebo arm. Symptoms of opioid withdrawal were evaluated using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), an 11-item scale that measures a constellation of withdrawal symptoms experienced after abstaining from opioid use. All ten subjects receiving IV Dex responded to treatment, while there were no

responders in the placebo arm. Results from this study demonstrated that IV Dex effectively mitigated the physiological symptoms of opioid withdrawal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Delirium. There are a number of studies which suggest that Dex can either prevent or mitigate agitation resulting from delirium based on information in an article published in the International Journal of Scientific Reports in 2017 by Zhang et al. We believe BXCL501 could be used in non‑surgical medical situations where hyperactive delirium is an outcome. We also believe BXCL501 would potentially be of high value in elderly patients in many medical situations outside of the ICU, such as the hospital floor and nursing homes. As a result of the delirium studies mentioned in the clinical section above, there is a defined therapeutic index in elderly patients which we believe may allow us to directly initiate a PoC clinical trial, without conducting the IV formulation of Dex study, potentially followed by a registration trial with BXCL501.

· | Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome. Acute alcohol withdrawal remains a widespread problem in hospitalized patients. Benzodiazepines remain the primary treatment for alcohol therapy to help control hyperadrenergic output in patients resulting in withdrawal. These patients are at increased risk of experiencing respiratory depression from benzodiazepine therapy. Based on information in an article published in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse in 2015 by Wong et al., in clinical trials, IV administration of Dex has shown potential for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome. We believe that performing a controlled clinical trial with BXCL501 in this population would be a logical next step to develop this product candidate.

· | Hyperarousal in PTSD. Hyperarousal is a primary symptom of post‑traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. It occurs when a patient becomes hyperaroused which could be as a result of a trigger or another event leading to recollection and re-experiencing or thinking about their trauma. Even though real danger may not be present, their body acts as if there is present danger, causing lasting stress after a traumatic event. The symptoms of hyperarousal include irritability, anger and angry outbursts, constant anxiety, restlessness and sleeping problems. We believe that BXCL501 has the potential to reduce symptoms which lead to agitation as well to produce a more natural sleep if taken before bedtime.

· | Pretreatment for MRI. Anxiety, due to feelings of claustrophobia or noise associated with an MRI, is common among patients who will undergo the procedure, which requires the patient to remain still. Currently, short acting oral benzodiazepines are used but must be taken well in advance of the MRI and could be followed by sluggishness and fatigue, confusion and amnesia. We believe that BXCL501 has the potential to calm patients so that they remain still during the procedure.

  BXCL 701, Potential First‑in‑Class DPP 8/9 and FAP Inhibitor for the Treatment of tNEPC and Pancreatic Cancer
     BXCL 701
 BXCL 701 is a potential first‑in‑class, highly potent, oral small molecule immuno‑modulator that is designed to both stimulate the innate immune system and inhibit immune evasion by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase, or DPP, 8/9 and fibroblast activation protein, or FAP. tNEPC and pancreatic cancer were selected as our lead indications after evaluating more than 100 different cancer types. These two indications are in the top three cancers that overexpressed or amplified DPP 8/9 and FAP. Data in the literature points to a functional role for DPP 8/9 in the biology of tNEPC.  Moreover, in a number of animal models, notably pancreatic cancer, BXCL701 has been observed to have combinatorial activity with checkpoint inhibitors and other combination partners.  These triple combinations result in complete regression with the generation of functional T-cell memory in certain animal models.  Specifically, DPP8 and DPP9 have been shown recently to behave as “immuno‑checkpoints”, as their inhibition results in a potent pro‑inflammatory, anti‑tumor activity by way of the induction of pyroptosis in macrophages. Pyroptosis results in induction of a number of cytokines, notably the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. This cytokine induction is believed to result in the downstream stimulation of multiple tumor‑killing immune cells.  Our data supports this, as it appears that cancer models with a high density of macrophages respond robustly to BXCL701 containing combination therapy, while those models with lower density of macrophages do not respond robustly to BXCL701 containing combination therapy. Taken together we 

 
  13

 
believe that BXCL701 activates an important component of the innate immune system thereby functionally inflaming the tumor microenvironment. Induction of an innate immune response within the tumor provides a host of pro-immune signals which drive subsequent stimulation and recruitment of the adaptive immune system. 
 Clinically, BXCL701 has been tested in more than 700 healthy subjects and cancer patients across multiple clinical trials, providing evidence of tolerability, proof of mechanism, and single agent anti‑tumor activity. In the latter case, single agent activity was seen in melanoma patients, an immuno‑sensitive tumor. While providing confidence on the safety profile of the drug, these clinical data also provide a maximum tolerated and recommended phase 2 dose to use in future clinical trials and support accelerated clinical development.  
 Thus, BXCL701 is a potential novel therapy for treatment‑emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer, or tNEPC, a segment of prostate cancer patients that have progressed on second‑generation androgen inhibitors (Zytiga and Xtandi).  Approximately one in four patients treated with Zytiga and Xtandi are expected to develop tNEPC based on current clinical literature. The combined global sales of Zytiga and Xtandi, which are only approved for prostate cancer treatment, were over $5 billion in 2017 and management believes such sales number gives a perspective of the potential market for BXCL701 in this indication. In pancreatic cancer, we estimate that approximately 20,000 patients would be eligible for treatment with BXCL701 annually as about 50% of pancreatic cancer patients can receive 2nd line therapy based on information in an article published in the Annals of Oncology in 2013 by Rahma et al. Based on our analysis, we believe that BXCL701 may establish a differentiated immuno‑oncology platform by functioning as an orally available innate immune activator and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other immune activating agents can convert immunologically “cold” cancers to immunologically “hot” ones. 
 Neurocrine-Prostrate Cancer Overview and Market Opportunity
     Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In 2018, there were an estimated 3 million men with prostate cancer in the United States. According to estimates from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, SEER, more than 164,000 men are expected to be diagnosed and more than 29,000 men were expected to die from prostate cancer in 2018. While the five‑year survival rate of local and regional prostate cancer is almost 100%, more aggressive forms of the disease such as metastatic prostate cancer have a five‑year survival rate of approximately 30%. These aggressive forms of prostate cancer can initially be treated with androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, however, almost all patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth which results in the patient having castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. An estimated 180,000 men in the United States are eligible for treatment with the second‑generation anti‑androgen drugs Zytiga and Xtandi. These drugs have widely become the standard of care and generated combined worldwide sales of over $5 billion in 2017.
 Unfortunately, virtually all the patients who respond to Zytiga and Xtandi are expected to progress to even more aggressive forms of prostate cancer requiring further treatment. About one‑third of the progressing patients will develop very aggressive, androgen receptor, or AR‑independent tumors, or tNEPC, for which there is no effective treatment based on information in an article published in the Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network in 2014 by Agarwal et. al. and an article published by Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2014 by Wang et. al. tNEPC specifically displays neuroendocrine differentiation, either pathologically with the presence of the typical neuroendocrine small cells, or molecularly by expressing neuroendocrine markers. BXCL701 is designed to target this tumor segment because 

 
  14

 
tNEPC has specific biology that is addressable by the mechanism of action of BXCL701. We believe that approximately 30,000 to 40,000 patients in the United States will develop tNEPC and can potentially be treated with BXCL701.

     Limitations of Current Treatments for tNEPC
     There is no approved therapy for tNEPC and therefore we intend to pursue breakthrough therapy designation for BXCL701. tNEPC patients are treated off‑label with cytotoxic chemotherapies, such as platinum‑based regimens. These treatments have poor efficacy due to their short duration of response and substantial toxicity. As discussed in more detail below, the immuno‑oncology field has made several advances in the treatment of solid tumors. However, several trials of immuno‑oncology agents in patients with prostate cancer, and specifically tNEPC, have shown limited or no anti‑tumor activity. We believe BXCL701 is a potential first‑in‑class therapy in tNEPC given its ability to convert immuno‑resistant tumors to immuno‑sensitive tumors (“cold” to “hot” tumors).

Our Solution: BXCL701, Potential First‑in‑Class, Oral, Small Molecule Inhibitor of DPP 8/9 and FAP
 We are not aware of any clinical stage competitors of BXCL701 in the DPP inhibitor class. The product candidate is designed to address the various ways by which DPP 8/9 and FAP play a role in the biology of tNEPC and pancreatic cancer. Specifically, it is able to directly affect tNEPC tumor cell survival and metastases but also modulate andti-cancer immunity against tNEPC and pancreatic cancer as described below.
 •Exhibiting Immuno‑mediated Activity Against tNEPC.  BXCL701 may potentially have the ability to modulate the immune system in multiple ways based on information in an article published in the Journal of Cancer Research in 2004 by Adams et al. and an article published in PLOS One in 2013 by Walsh et al., several of which are relevant to its ability to treat tNEPC, including 

· | stimulating the activation of multiple immune cell types
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | stimulating tumor cell killing by inducing the priming, migration and cytotoxicity of T‑cells and the formation of memory T‑cells

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | synergistically increasing checkpoint inhibitor anti‑tumor activity.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inhibiting tNEPC Growth Factor NPY. tNEPC is believed to be caused by neuroendocrine cells in the prostate that overexpress NPY. NPY activates the specific G protein‑coupled receptor Y1‑R, which then selectively stimulates growth of AR‑independent, tNEPC‑like cancer cells, while reducing growth in AR‑dependent cells. NPY is a substrate of DPP 8/9, which cleaves it into biologically active forms. DPP 8/9 inhibition in tumor cells decreases the number of viable tumor cells by reducing NPY cleavage. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Inhibiting the Formation of tNEPC‑type (Osteoclastic) Bone Metastasis. Prostate cancer is characterized by the presence of bone‑forming (osteoblastic) metastasis. In contrast, tNEPC is associated with bone‑lysing (osteoclastic) metastasis. BXCL701 is designed to block the bone destruction by osteoclasts through the inhibition of osteoclast differentiation. In an animal model that recapitulated the formation of osteolytic metastasis of tNEPC, BXCL701 was observed to reduce osteoclast activity, bone resorption and tumor burden based on information in an article published in the British Journal of Haematology in 2009 by Pennisi et al.

  BXCL 701 for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer
     Pancreatic Cancer Overview and Market Opportunity 
     Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, more commonly referred as pancreatic cancer, represents one of the highest unmet needs in oncology. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2019 there will be approximately 57,000 new diagnoses and 46,000 deaths. Pancreatic cancer has a median five‑year survival rate of only about 8%. Recently, several new therapies have been developed consisting of new formulations of approved chemotherapies. However, these new therapies have limited efficacy with relatively short survival advantages, and well‑known toxicities. It is well understood that the development of new efficacious drugs with manageable toxicity is required to achieve durable responses and increase survival in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is known to be a highly immuno‑resistant tumor. Multiple attempts to show anti‑tumor activity of immunotherapies including immune checkpoints have failed due to primary resistance mechanisms. We believe BXCL701 has the potential to address the resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (to convert “cold” tumors “hot”) and the combination with Anti-PD-1 inhibitors and other agents, particularly those such as Nektar Therapeutics’ NKTR-214 that activate the adaptive immune response, could generate long and profound responses and the survival increase needed to make a true breakthrough in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
 Abraxane, a new formulation of the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, is considered to be the standard of care for newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer in U.S. markets, with annual sales of almost $1 billion. Onivyde, a liposomal formulation of the chemotherapy agent irinotecan, was recently approved for use in second‑line pancreatic cancer based on a two‑month survival increase (six months vs. four months) and only 7.7% ORR, with annual sales of approximately $80 million. Our initial clinical development plan will target second‑line or later pretreated patients, specifically the 50% or more that remain in good clinical condition after first‑line treatment and thus may receive one or more subsequent lines of chemotherapy. Therefore, we believe that the potential number of patients treatable with the combination of BXCL701, a check point inhibitor and Nektar 214, if successfully developed and approved, would be approximately 20,000.
 Pancreatic cancer is a high unmet medical need, where approved therapies have limited activity and patients have short survival. As in tNEPC, single agent immune checkpoint inhibition has not shown single agent anti‑tumor activity in pancreatic cancer patients, except in the very small (1-2%) fraction that exhibit MSI-H phenotype, indicating the need for a molecule like BXCL701 to optimize their activity. Preclinical studies indicate that the combination of DPP8/9 and 

 
  16

 
FAP and immune checkpoint inhibition is active. BXCL701 has been granted orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

 BXCL 701 Clinical Trials
 We have initiated one BXCL 701 trial and plan to launch two additional studies in 2019.
 In November 2018 we announced that the FDA accepted our IND for BXCL701. This First-in-human Phase 1b / 2 combination trial of BXCL701 and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) was initiated during the fourth quarter of 2018, with the first patient expected to be enrolled in early 2019. We plan to enroll up to forty patients at multiple clinical sites.
 The goal of this single arm, Simon 2-stage open label study is to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity combining of BXCL701 and pembrolizumab in tNEPC patients with the efficacy endpoint of objective response rate. Data readouts are expected throughout 2019.
 We are planning to begin clinical development of BXCL701 in pancreatic cancer in the first half of 2019 in a leading medical center in a treatment naïve population. This study is expected to enroll up to 15 patients and we anticipate initiating this study in the first half of 2019.   
 Nektar Therapeutics Collaborative Agreement
 On September 21, 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Nektar Therapeutics, a Delaware corporation (“Nektar”). Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Nektar will jointly collaborate to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating a combination therapy using  BXCL701, NKTR-214, a CD122-biased agonist (“NKTR-214”) and a checkpoint inhibitor as a potential therapy for pancreatic cancer and such other clinical trials evaluating the combined therapy as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties (each, a “Combined Therapy Trial”). Under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties will split all out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred from third parties in connection with the performance of a Combined Therapy Trial, including, but not limited to, third party contract research organizations, laboratories, clinical sites and institutional 

 
  17

 
review boards. Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with each Combined Therapy Trial. The Company and Nektar will use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture and supply its compound for each Combined Therapy Trial and will bear the costs related thereto. The parties have formed a joint development committee to oversee clinical trial design, regulatory strategy, and other activities necessary to conduct and support the Combined Therapy Trials. The Company will act as sponsor of each Combined Therapy Trial. Ownership of, and global commercial rights to, BXCL701 remains solely with the Company under the Collaboration Agreement. Ownership of any patent rights and study data that does not relate exclusively to BXCL701 or NKTR-214 shall be jointly owned by the parties. Each party granted to the other party a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable and royalty-free research and development license to such licensing party’s patent rights, technology and regulatory documentation to use its compound solely to the extent necessary to discharge its obligations under the Agreement with respect to the conduct of the Combined Therapy Trials.
 Subject to termination rights for breach, bankruptcy or a material safety issue/clinical hold, the term of the Collaboration Agreement will continue in effect until completion by all centers or institutions participating in the Combined Therapy Trials, the delivery of study data to both parties and the completion of any then agreed upon protocol, statistical analysis and bioanalysis plan.
     On March 4, 2019 the Company announced the addition of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which operates its biopharmaceutical business as EMD Serono in the USA and Canada, and Pfizer Inc. to the Nektar  clinical collaboration described above to evaluate a novel triple combination therapy in pancreatic cancer. The collaboration now includes avelumab, BXCL701 and NKTR-214 as a potential combination therapy for pancreatic cancer. Avelumab is a human anti-programmed death ligand (PD-L1) co-developed and co-commercialized by Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer. 
 Under the collaboration, BTI will continue to be responsible for initiating and managing the clinical program, with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer supplying avelumab and Nektar supplying NKTR-214. BTI and Nektar will equally share all development costs.
 Manufacturing
 We have successfully completed Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) manufacturing and delivery of BXCL 701 drug product – oral tablets for clinical investigation.
    
Other Immuno-oncology Indications
     In addition to tNEPC and pancreatic cancer, we plan to leverage our existing preclinical and clinical data to identify other cancer types with high unmet medical need that would benefit from BXCL701’s novel mechanism of action. We are prioritizing those where the immuno‑suppressive microenvironment is driven by the molecular and cellular targets of BXCL701 and where the single agent activity of approved immune checkpoint inhibitors is limited.
 In addition, we believe BXCL701 provides a platform for combination with immunotherapy modalities that go beyond the currently approved immune checkpoint agents that target the PD‑1/PD‑L1 axis. Following our PoC trials, we plan to conduct clinical trials covering a broad range of additional combinations with other immunotherapy agents including:

· | immune checkpoint inhibitors (other than PD‑1/PD‑L1)
--+-----------------------------------------------------


· | cellular therapies (CAR‑T and chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | therapeutic vaccines
--+---------------------


· | antibody‑dependent cell‑mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC, driven monoclonal antibodies

     Other Product Candidates
 Neuroscience Program
 We are targeting neuroscience disorders where there is high unmet medical need and therefore a requirement for symptom management is a priority (like agitation, seizures, dyskinesias) as well for transformative care for monogenic rare CNS disorders.
 For symptomatic approaches, our neuroscience program is developing a FDA Section 505(b)(2) opportunities with a focus on treating symptoms for various neurological and psychiatric disorders. This entails re‑innovating existing agents through formulation changes and deuteration. The utilization of EvolverAI has identified several monogenic diseases with available animal models across rare neuroscience diseases. We utilize proprietary algorithms to identify associated mechanisms with existing pharmacology to test whether these agents can improve the disease profile in the animal model either through disease modification or symptomatic manner. The agents identified must be those that we believe are Phase 2 ready with a potential for a short, cost‑effective development plan (four to five years to NDA filing).
 In addition, we continue our work to expand the indication for BXCL501 to treat symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal based on positive data from our Phase 1b study of IV Dex.
 Immuno‑oncology Program
 Our immuno‑oncology program is based on utilizing a comprehensive map of all known relationships that link immuno‑evasion and immuno‑activation pathways and targets with thousands of pharmacological agents and tumor indications. This comprehensive map has permitted us to select a potential pipeline of candidates based on our ability to alter the tumor micro‑environment and the potential to address relevant unmet medical needs for various tumor types.
 The lead candidates are clinically validated in oncology and therefore represent opportunities where we believe clinical development risk may be reduced.

Finally we continually leverage the artificial intelligence platform owned by our parent, to select and prioritize additional development opportunities to expand the current portfolio and broaden the addressable market for our lead programs through identification of new indications. This includes exploring additional combination therapy approaches to expand BXCL701’s target indications beyond tNEPC and pancreatic cancer.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The immuno‑oncology, neuroscience and rare disease segments of the industry in particular are highly competitive. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions.
 Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

 
  19

 

 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related therapeutics, if any, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third‑party payors.
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or less expensive than any medicines we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third‑party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic medicines currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing and additional generics are expected to become available over the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic medicines.
 Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. If the product candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in development.
 Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders
 Drugs used for the acute treatment of agitation resulting from psychosis in schizophrenia and mania in bipolar disease are atypical antipsychotics administered IM and require patient restraint. These include IM aripiprazole, olanzapine, ziprasidone and haloperidol. Oral products include the benzodiazepines, lorazepam and midazolam. Saphris (sublingual tablet asenapine) is an atypical antipsychotic that has been prescribed for use in children and teens for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disease. Adasuve (inhaled loxapine) from Alexza is also a non‑invasive treatment. Avanir is currently in Phase 3 with Nuedexta, a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine for treating chronic agitation in dementia. Immuno‑oncology
 The immuno‑oncology field is characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and products and by fierce competition based on the development of compounds, often with similar mechanisms of action. Clinical development plans are further compounded by the possibility of overlapping intellectual property. A wide variety of commercial players, large pharmaceutical companies, established and emerging biotechnology companies, and several not‑for‑profit entities are actively developing potentially competitive products in immuno‑oncology and in our lead indications.
 While we believe our product candidates, technology, knowledge, and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Such companies include:

· | Major pharmaceutical companies developing multiple immuno‑oncology agents: AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol‑Myers Squibb Company, Celgene Corporation, Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding Ltd. and Sanofi SA. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies developing agents aimed at stimulating the immune response: AdaptImmune LLC, Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp., NewLink Genetic Corporation, Advaxis, Inc., Argos Therapeutics, Inc., Biovest International, Inc., ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., Immune Design, Inc., Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Intrexon Corporation and Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Companies developing cell‑based immunotherapy approaches: Intrexon Corporation, Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc. (acquired by Gilead Sciences, Inc.), Novartis AG and Pfizer Inc.

     Manufacturing
 We do not have manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on strategic manufacturing partners and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical research as well as for eventual, possible commercial manufacturing.
 For supply of drug substance and drug product for our BXCL501 clinical program, manufacturing partners have been identified. ARx LLC, USA is responsible for the development and manufacturing of sublingual thin films of dexmedetomidine for BXCL501 and has produced GMP grade drug product for clinical trial. 
 We have produced clinical drug product for BXCL701 under exclusivity with the original manufacturers for API and tablets, respectively.  
 Manufacturing partners used for both programs currently manufacture commercial products and we consider them to be suitable for commercial supply.
 Commercialization
 We plan to retain our worldwide commercialization rights for some of our key product candidates while for other product candidates we might consider collaboration opportunities to maximize returns.
 While we currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in commercializing products, we intend to build our own commercialization organization and capabilities over time. When appropriate, we will decide whether to build a specialty sales force to manage commercialization for these product candidates on our own or in combination with a larger pharmaceutical partner to maximize patient coverage in the United States and to support global expansion, especially as our programs have substantial opportunity for additional follow‑up indications alone or in combinations.
 As product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of the target market, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our United States, European Union, and rest‑of‑world strategies.
 Intellectual Property
     Our policy is to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business by filing patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, and know‑how relating to our proprietary technologies and product candidates, continuing innovation and in‑licensing technology and products. This reliance is expected to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position for novel therapeutics and novel formulations of existing therapeutics across multiple therapeutic areas. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available. Patent Portfolio
     We have filed patent applications to protect our proprietary drug programs in immuno-oncology, CNS and agitation. This encompasses our proprietary drug programs in immuno-oncology, CNS and agitation. These proprietary products and methods of use are covered in three separate Patent Cooperation Treaty applications, four pending national phase applications and three pending United States provisional applications to date. However, we intend to file national phase patent applications in all other major counties (Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and China) in the future. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non‑provisional patent application. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product 

 
  21

 
candidates, a United States patent we own or license may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the drug approval regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one‑half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
 The patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we license, and also could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company‑owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use, or the manufacture of those products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we in‑license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in‑license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 Midatech Data Purchase Agreement Related to BXCL701 
     On January 4, 2016, BioXcel executed a Data Purchase Agreement with Midatech Pharma US Inc., the successor of Dara Biosciences, itself successor of the original developer of Talabostat mesylate, or Talabostat, pursuant to which Midatech transferred to BioXcel all rights, title, and interests to all preclinical, clinicial, Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls and any other relevant data related to Talabostat. Subsequently, Midatech also transferred the ownership of Talabostat IND 62379 to BioXcel and communicated such transfer to the FDA. This agreement was assigned to us pursuant to the asset contribution agreement, effective June 30, 2017, with BioXcel, as amended and restated on November 7, 2017, or the Contribution Agreement. 
 Our Relationship with BioXcel Corporation 
     We are currently a 60.5% owned subsidiary of BioXcel and our pipeline compounds have been identified by applying BioXcel's R&D engine, EvolverAI, for drug re-innovation.

         The Company has entered into a Contribution Agreement, to which BioXcel, to which BioXcel agreed to contribute BioXcel's rights, title and interest in BXCL501, BXCL701, BXCL502 and BXCL702, collectively, the “Candidates” or the BTI Business and all of the assets and liabilities associated in consideration for (i) 9,480,000 shares of our common stock, (ii) $1 million upon completion of our initial public offering, or IPO (iii) $500,000 upon the later of the 12 month anniversary of an initial public offering and the first dosing of a patient in the bridging bioavailability/ bioequivalence study for the BXCL501 program, (iv) $500,000 upon the later of the 12 month anniversary of an initial public offering and the first dosing of a patient in the Phase 2 PoC open label monotherapy or combination trial with Keytruda for the BXCL701 program and (v) a one-time payment of $5,000,000 within 60 days after the achievement of $50,000,000 in cumulative net sales of any product or combination of products resulting from the development and commercialization of any one of the Candidates or a product derived therefrom. With the completion of the Company’s IPO in March 2018, $1 million was charged to Research and Development costs in connection with (ii) above and was paid on April 5, 2018.
 We entered into a separation and shared services agreement with BioXcel that took effect on June 30, 2017, as amended and restated on November 7, 2017, or the Services Agreement, pursuant to which BioXcel will allow us to continue to use the office space, equipment, services and leased employees based on the agreed upon terms and conditions for a payment of defined monthly and/or hourly fees. The parties have agreed that the services and office space provided under the Services Agreement shall decrease over time until the 12-month anniversary of the date of the Services Agreement. The office space and equipment portion of the Services Agreement ended effectively on April 30, 2018 when the Company moved to new office space to accommodate additional personnel that had been hired. Services to be provided by BioXcel through its subsidiary in India, were originally expected to decrease through June 30, 2019 provided such dates may be extended upon mutual agreement between the parties.  The parties are currently discussing extending the term of these services provided however no definitive agreement has been agreed upon as of the date hereof.  There can be no assurance that the parties will agree to any extension to the Services Agreement in the future.
 On or before December 31, 2019, the Company will have the option to enter into a collaborative services agreement with BioXcel pursuant to which BioXcel shall perform product identification and related services for us utilizing EvolverAI. We have agreed that this agreement will be negotiated in good faith and that such agreement will incorporate reasonable market-based terms, including consideration for BioXcel reflecting a low, single-digit royalty on net sales and reasonable development and commercialization milestone payments, provided that (i) development milestones shall not exceed $10 million in the aggregate and not be payable prior to proof of concept in humans and (ii) commercialization milestones shall be based on reaching annual net sales levels, be limited to 3% of the applicable net sales level, and not exceed $30 million in the aggregate. BioXcel shall continue to make such product identification and related services available to us for at least five years from June 30, 2017. The parties are currently discussing extending the product identification and related services that BioXcel would provide however no definitive agreement has been agreed upon as of the date hereof.  There can be no assurance that the parties will agree to any extension to the collaborative services agreement in the future.
 In connection with the Services Agreement, BioXcel had agreed to provide the Company a line of credit, which was capped at $1,000,000 or the Total Funding Amount, pursuant to the terms of a grid note, or the Grid Note. The Grid Note was payable upon the earlier of (i) the completion of an initial public offering and (ii) December 31, 2018, together with interest on the unpaid balance of each advance made under the Grid Note, which would accrue at a rate per annum equal to the applicable federal rate for short-term loans as of the date hereof, in each case calculated based on a 365‑day year and actual days elapsed. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had drawn down $371,000 under the Grid Note.
 All amounts due to BioXcel under the Grid Note, and for expenses paid on the Company’s behalf were paid following the completion of the Company’s IPO on March 20, 2018.

    Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing 

 
  23

 
and distribution of drugs and medical devices, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post‑approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
 U.S. Government Regulation of Drug Products
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

· | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLP regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our products in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre‑approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with any post‑approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a REMS and the potential requirement to conduct post‑approval studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human studies. The IND also includes results of preclinical studies or other human studies, as appropriate, as well as manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to support the use of the investigational new drug. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trials. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before clinical trials can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the new investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical trial site’s IRB before the trials may be initiated, and the IRB must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries.
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:

· | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or in healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the investigational drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the investigational drug’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of well‑controlled and scientifically valid Phase 2 clinical trials. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes controlled clinical trials conducted to preliminarily or further evaluate the effectiveness of the investigational drug for a particular indication(s) in patients with the disease or condition under study, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically well‑controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a limited patient population. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit‑risk relationship of the investigational drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A registration study is any clinical study, which adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies but may also be Phase 2 studies if the trial design provides a well‑controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or 

 
  25

 
terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications.
 The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of an NDA to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of submission or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life‑threatening indication, six months from submission. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee but it typically follows such recommendations.
 The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.

 
  26

 

 After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also approve the NDA with a REMS plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post‑market studies or clinical trials. Such post‑market testing may include Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post‑marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 After regulatory approval of a drug product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post‑approval requirements. As a holder of an approved NDA, we would be required to report, among other things, certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval to ensure and preserve the long‑term stability of the drug product. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third‑party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in, among other things,

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post‑approval clinical trials
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

  Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other 

 
  27

 
risk management measures. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs or devices may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off‑label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off‑label uses may be subject to significant liability. Also, from time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five‑year period of non‑patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non‑infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three‑year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active pharmaceutical ingredient. Five‑year and three‑year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Available Special Regulatory Procedures
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. Fast Track Designation
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. Priority Review
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and 

 
  28

 
decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life‑threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Accelerated Approval Pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life‑threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct in a diligent manner additional post‑approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post‑marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post‑approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post‑approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post‑marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.

 The Hatch‑Waxman Amendments: 505(b)(2) Approval Process
 Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (i) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (ii) such patent has expired; (iii) the date on which such patent expires; or (iv) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain or carves out any language regarding the patented method‑of‑use rather than certify to a listed method‑of‑use patent. If the reference NDA holder and patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired.
 Our current and anticipated product candidates will be based on already approved active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, rather than new chemical entities, and a formulation that has been through Phase 1 studies. Accordingly, we expect to be able to rely on information from previously conducted formulation studies involving our clinical development plans and our NDA submissions. For product candidates that involve novel fixed‑dose combinations of existing drugs or for studies of an existing product or product candidate in a new indication, we believe we generally will be able to initiate Phase 2/3 studies without conducting any new non‑clinical or Phase 1 studies, though the FDA may not agree with our conclusions and may require us to conduct additional clinical or preclinical studies prior to initiating Phase 3 or other pivotal clinical trials. In those instances where our product candidate is a pharmacokinetically enhanced version of an approved API, we will need to conduct certain non‑clinical and Phase 1 studies to confirm the pharmacokinetic profile of the product candidate prior to conducting Phase 2/3 studies.
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 The Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan drug designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 

 
  30

 
Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan drug indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan drug product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan drug product has exclusivity. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receives orphan exclusivity, we may still be subject to competition. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 International Regulations
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country‑specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Centralized Procedure
 The European Medicines Agency, or EMA, implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the EU. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active 

 
  31

 
substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several European Union countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure the decentralized procedure and the mutual recognition procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country for medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Under the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following a national authorization, the applicant may seek further marketing authorizations from other EU countries under a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original national marketing authorization.
 In the EU medicinal products designated as orphan drug products benefit from financial incentives such as reductions in marketing authorization application fees or fee waivers and 10 years of marketing exclusivity following medicinal product approval. For a medicinal product to qualify as orphan drugs (i) it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life‑threatening or chronically debilitating; (ii) the prevalence of the condition in the EU must not be more than five in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and (iii) no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
 Accelerated Review (European Union)
 Based on results of the Phase 3 clinical trial(s) submitted in an NDA, upon the request of an applicant, the FDA may grant the NDA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months. Priority review is granted where preliminary estimates indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, or a significant improvement compared to marketed products is possible. If criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Product for Human Use or CHMP, accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease (e.g. heavy disabling or life‑threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding clock stops.
 There can be no assurance that we or any of our partners would be able to satisfy one or more of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. 

 
  32

 
Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products. Further, the Healthcare Reform Law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed in the United States by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law establishes:

· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, or the “donut hole”
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We expect that federal, state and local governments in the United States will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the product candidates that we are developing.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, new products are facing increasingly high barriers to entry. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is secured for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. For example, in the United States, there are federal and 

 
  33

 
state anti‑kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services or reward past purchases or recommendations. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The reach of the Anti‑Kickback Statute was broadened by the Healthcare Reform Law, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 USC. §1320a‑7b, effective March 23, 2010. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The “qui tam” provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim.
 Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third‑party payers. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their business associates governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information.
 In order to raise sufficient financial resources to continue to advance our product candidates, we will need to address pricing pressures and potential third‑party reimbursement coverage for our product candidates. In the United States and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third‑party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It is and will continue to be time‑consuming and expensive for us or our strategic collaborators to go through the process of seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our products may not be considered cost effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
 The Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals, or medical 

 
  34

 
supplies covered under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to report annually to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals, during the course of the preceding calendar year. The Final Rule implementing the Sunshine Act, published on February 8, 2013, required data collection on payments beginning on August 1, 2013. The first annual report, comprised of data collected from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, was due March 31, 2014. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1 million). We will be required to collect data on and report these payments.
 In many foreign markets, including the countries in the European Union, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental pricing control.
