The Neighborhood Sandwich Shop
 Potbelly Corporation is a neighborhood sandwich concept that has been feeding customers’ smiles with warm, toasty sandwiches, signature salads, hand-dipped shakes and other fresh menu items, customized just the way customers want them, for more than 40 years. Potbelly promises Fresh, Fast & Friendly service in an environment that reflects the local neighborhood. Our employees are trained to engage with our customers in a genuine way to provide a personalized experience. Our shops feature vintage design elements and locally-themed décor inspired by the neighborhood that we believe create a lively atmosphere. Through this combination, we believe we are creating a devoted base of Potbelly fans that return again and again. 
 We believe that a key to our past and future success is our culture. It is embodied in The Potbelly Advantage, which is an expression of our Vision, Mission and Values, and the foundation of everything we do. Our Vision is to create an experience people love to share. Our Mission is to help people love lunch again. Our Values embody both how we lead and how we behave and form the cornerstone of our culture. We use simple language that resonates from the frontline associate to the most senior levels of the organization, creating shared expectations and accountabilities in how we approach our day-to-day activities. We strive to be a fun, friendly and hardworking group of people who enjoy taking care of our customers, while at the same time taking care of each other. 
 As of December 30, 2018, we had a domestic base of 478 shops in 32 states and the District of Columbia. Of these, the company operated 437 shops and franchisees operated 41 shops. In addition, there were 8 international franchised shops, including 4 shops in the Middle East, 2 shops in Canada and 2 shops in India. Potbelly’s total shop base reduced by 1.2% over the prior year. Potbelly generated shop-level profit margin of 16.7%, 18.2%, 19.7%, 19.4% and 19.2% in 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively (shop-level profit margin measures net shop sales less shop operating expenses as a percentage of net shop sales).
 Shop-level profit margin is not required by, nor presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). See “Selected Financial Data” in Item 6 for a discussion of shop-level profit margin and a reconciliation of the differences between shop-level profit and income (loss) from operations, as well as a calculation of shop-level profit margin. 
 Our History
 Potbelly started in 1977 as a small antique store on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago. To boost sales, the original owner began offering toasty warm sandwiches to customers. Soon, people who had no interest in antiques were stopping by to enjoy the delicious sandwiches, homemade desserts and live music featured in the shop. As time passed, Potbelly became a well-known neighborhood destination with a loyal following of regulars and frequent lines out the door.
 Potbelly opened its second shop in 1997 and continued to open shops in more neighborhoods reaching 100 shops in 2005, 200 shops in 2008, 300 shops in 2013 and 400 shops in 2016. Throughout the growth, each new shop has maintained a similar look, vibe and experience that defines the Potbelly brand. Though our shops vary in size and shape, we maintain core elements in each new location, such as fast and efficient line flow, vintage décor customized with local details and exceptional customer focus.
 Just like our first shop on Lincoln Avenue, we are committed to building deep community roots in all the neighborhoods we serve.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe the following competitive strengths provide a platform for us to achieve continued growth:
 Simple, Made-to-Order Food. Our menu features items made from high quality ingredients, such as fresh vegetables, hearth-baked bread and all-natural, white meat chicken. We also use whole muscle turkey, ham and roast beef, rather than chopped and formed deli meats. See “—Our Food—Our Menu” for more information on our ingredients. Our sandwiches are made fresh to order, and many are based on the original recipes from 1977. They are served toasty warm on our signature multigrain or regular bread or on our multigrain Flats, all of which are delivered to our shops. Our sandwiches can be customized with a variety of toppings, including our unique Potbelly hot peppers that are made with a combination of spices exclusively for us. We make our sandwiches to have the right balance of ingredients with the last bite tasting as good as the first. Our generously sized cookies are baked fresh daily in each shop, and our hand-dipped shakes, malts and smoothies are made from real ingredients and come with our signature butter cookie on the straw. Our menu regularly evolves based on consumer trends and customer feedback. Among other things, we solicit customer feedback quarterly via in-person “Customer Advisories” in our major markets and conduct an annual customer survey to help determine trends. See “—Our Food—Customer Feedback” for more information about these surveys. We believe our simple menu and freshly-made food offer ease of ordering and broad appeal and help us create loyal Potbelly fans that return again and again.

Differentiated Customer Experience That Delivers a Neighborhood Feel. We strive to provide a positive customer experience that is driven by both our employees and the atmosphere of our shops. We look to hire employees that are outgoing people and train them to interact with our customers in a genuine way while providing fast service. Each of our shops features vintage décor and shared design elements, such as the use of wood, wallpaper motifs and our signature Potbelly stove. In addition, our shops display locally-themed photos and other decorative items inspired by the neighborhood. Every Potbelly location strives to be “The Neighborhood Sandwich Shop,” creating devoted fans who tell others about their experience. We believe our shops are strongly integrated into the neighborhood through the use of local managers and locally-themed décor and engage with customers through initiatives such as fundraising for local causes and other promotions that cater to local interests. The unique Potbelly experience encourages repeat customer visits and drives increased sales.
 Attractive Shop Economics. Our shop model is designed to generate, and has generated, strong cash flow, attractive shop-level financial results and high returns on investment. We operate our shops successfully in a wide range of geographic markets, population densities and real estate settings. We aim to generate average shop-level profit margins, a non-GAAP measure, that range from the high teens to above 20% and target cash-on-cash returns, on new company-operated shops, above 25% after two full years of operation. Our ability to achieve such margins and returns depends on a number of factors. For example, we face increasing labor and commodity costs, which we have partially offset by increasing menu prices. Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain these returns, we believe our attractive shop economics support our ability to profitably grow our brand in new and existing markets.
 Management Team with Substantial Operating Experience. Our senior management team has extensive operating experience across disciplines in the restaurant and retail sectors, including store operations, marketing, human resources, innovation, real estate, franchise, supply chain and finance. This team has an average of 21 years of retail and restaurant industry experience, and many of our executives have experience at large public companies. In 2017, we hired our President and CEO, Alan Johnson. Alan has over 30 years of executive leadership experience across a variety of retail and restaurant organizations. We believe our experienced leadership team is a key driver of our success and positions us to execute our long-term growth strategy.
 Distinct, Deep-Rooted Culture: The Potbelly Advantage. We believe our culture is a key to our success. It is embodied in The Potbelly Advantage, which is an expression of our Vision, Mission and Values. The Potbelly Advantage is the written mission statement for our company that is shared with everyone who works at our company, from our top executives to shop associates. We believe such a mission statement serves as the foundation of everything we do. Our Vision is to create an experience people love to share. Our Mission is to help people love lunch again. We strive to emphasize our Values throughout all levels of our organization including in our hiring process and training programs. The Potbelly Values form a common language across our organization that we believe makes Potbelly a place our employees love to work. Through our Ethics Code of Conduct, ongoing training, and evaluations we encourage our employees to perform at their personal best and help them to work together as a team to make sure we deliver a positive experience to everyone who works here. See “—Shop Operations and Management—Our People.” Our culture helps us attract and retain employees and has contributed to our better than industry average hourly turnover rate of 95% for the year ended December 30, 2018. We believe The Potbelly Advantage allows us to deliver operational excellence and grow our business and our base of devoted Potbelly fans.
 Our Business Strategy
 We strive to grow profitability and create value for our stockholders by working to achieve the goals listed below. While we cannot provide assurances that we will achieve and maintain these objectives, we consider each of them to be a core strategy of our business.
 Shop Operations. We believe that continued excellence in shop-level execution is fundamental to our growth strategy. To maintain our operational standards, we use a Balanced Scorecard approach to measure People, Customers, Sales and Profits at each of our shops. Hiring the right people and maintaining optimal staffing levels enable us to run efficient operations. We track metrics such as peak hour throughput, Customer Satisfaction Survey Results and neighborhood engagement activities, such as fundraisers for local causes, to improve the customer experience. Shop sales and profitability are benchmarked against prior year periods and budget, and we focus on achieving targets on a shop-by-shop basis. To support our shop operators, we invest in systems and technology that can meaningfully improve shop-level execution. For example, we have applied technology to administrative activity to enable complete front-of-house, thereby maintaining customer focus. In addition, we are expanding our off-premise business, including catering, delivery and pickup, which we view as additional growth drivers.
 5

Our approach to margin enhancement begins with continuous efforts to improve the financial results of our shops. We focus on cash-on-cash returns to the company and look to grow shop-level profitability each year through sales growth and productivity improvements. We also focus on cash flow generation, which supports our self-funded development model of sourcing our liquidity and capital resource needs primarily from operating activities and cash and cash equivalents. We also have a credit facility to provide another source of liquidity and to manage cash flow timing. Currently, we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. We believe we exercise strong financial discipline in managing expenses and by encouraging employee efficiency with the goal of achieving and maintaining general and administrative expenses under 10% of revenue. In addition, we expect our sales and shop-level profit margin to grow faster than general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2018, our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 11.1%. Our intention is to achieve average shop-level profit margins that range from the high teens to above 20% as we continue to grow. However, we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain our shop-level profit margin levels or that we will be able to achieve or maintain low levels of expenses.
 Shop Development. Our company-operated shops are successful in diverse markets in 23 states and the District of Columbia, and we intend to continue to build company-operated shops in both new and existing markets utilizing our thoughtful site selection process. We evaluate a number of metrics to assess the optimal sites for our new shops, including neighborhood daytime population, site visibility, traffic and accessibility, along with an on-the-ground qualitative assessment of the characteristics of each unique trade area. This location-specific approach to development allows us to leverage our versatile shop format, which does not have standardized requirements with respect to size, shape or location, to achieve strong returns across a wide range of real estate settings. See “—Site Selection and Expansion—Shop Design” for more information about our shop requirements. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we opened 10, 34 and 40 new company-operated shops, respectively, and expanded into Salt Lake City, San Antonio, El Paso, Indianapolis and Oklahoma City. In those same time periods, we closed ten shops, eight shops and two shops, respectively, due to under-performance or lease expirations. Additionally, during April 2016, the Company purchased one franchise shop, converting it into a company-operated shop. In the near term we will continue to close underperforming shops and reduce our rate of company-operated shop growth.
 Marketing. We believe that our premise of a “Neighborhood Sandwich Shop” has broad appeal across a wide range of market types and geographies. Based on our management’s experience, we believe a significant contributor to this success is our passionate customers that are natural brand advocates who enjoy their Potbelly experience and tell others about it. We learn from the formal customer feedback we solicit (See “—Our Food—Customer Feedback”), and from managers and employees who interact with customers in our shops, that many customers in new markets report positive recommendations from friends and family members who live in regions with established Potbelly shops. We believe that our positive brand perception helps drive interest in our shops in both existing and new markets. We enhance this with our social and digital interactions and complement our distinctive in-shop experience with online access, allowing customers to order ahead through both our website and Potbelly app, including catering, delivery or in-shop pick up.
 Franchising. In 2010, we initiated a program to franchise shops in selected markets in the U.S. As of December 30, 2018, we had domestic franchise shops in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. As we further develop our franchise program, we intend to expand the number of franchise shops on a disciplined basis. We focus on markets we believe have appropriate characteristics for our franchise shops and on franchisees that are compatible with the Potbelly culture. As of December 30, 2018, our franchisees operated 41 shops domestically. In addition, we have signed international franchise development agreements to open franchises in the Middle East; Ontario, Canada; and Delhi, India. We have a franchise development agreement with the Alshaya Trading Company W.L.L. (“Alshaya”), a leading franchisee of retail brands, to develop shops in the Middle East. As of December 30, 2018, Alshaya operated 4 shops in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. In 2015, we entered into a franchise development agreement with Halsted Hospitality Ltd. (“Halsted”), pursuant to which Halsted has the exclusive right to develop Potbelly shops in the province of Ontario, Canada for a period of ten years. The first Potbelly shop in Toronto, Ontario, opened in October 2016. As of December 30, 2018, Halsted operated two franchise shops in Ontario, Canada. We do not anticipate Halsted will open additional Potbelly shops in Canada. In 2017 we entered into a franchise development agreement with Kwals Café Private Limited (“Kwals”), pursuant to which Kwals has the exclusive rights to develop Potbelly shops in certain states in India. The first Potbelly shop in Delhi, India, opened in December 2017. See “—Franchising” for more information about our domestic and international franchise programs. Although we do not expect franchise activities to result in significant revenue in the near term, we see the selective expansion of our franchising efforts to be a valuable potential growth opportunity over time.
Our Food
 Our Menu
 Each of our shops offers freshly-made food with high quality ingredients. The majority of our sales are generated during lunch, but dinner and breakfast (in locations with high early morning traffic) are also important to our business. Our menu currently includes toasty warm sandwiches, signature salads, soups, chili, sides, desserts and, in our breakfast locations, breakfast sandwiches and steel cut oatmeal.

Every toasty warm sandwich on the Potbelly menu is made-to-order and customizable, with many based on the original recipes from 1977. Sandwiches are made with our signature multigrain or regular bread as “Originals” (our “regular” size), “Bigs” (30% bigger) or “Skinnys” (less meat and cheese starting under 400 calories); or on “Flats” (thin multigrain bread which is 90 calories less than our Originals). Each of our sandwiches can be customized with a variety of toppings, including our unique Potbelly hot peppers that are made with a combination of spices exclusively for us. We believe our sandwiches have the right balance of ingredients with the last bite tasting as good as the first.
 Our core sandwich offerings include Turkey Breast, Italian, Grilled Chicken and Cheddar, Smoked Ham, A Wreck, Chicken Salad, Meatball, Pizza Sandwich, Mediterranean, Roast Beef, Tuna Salad and the Turkey Club. Customers can also order off-menu sandwiches and variations on our sandwiches, including the “Wrecking Ball” (A Wreck plus meatballs), the “Lucky Seven” (which includes all seven of our sliced meat choices) and the “Cheeseburger” (the Meatball with cheddar cheese and no marinara). These items are on what our loyal fans call the “Underground Menu,” which contributes to the special connection between Potbelly and our customers.
 Our shops also offer salads which are made fresh to order with high quality ingredients. Our signature salads include the Uptown Salad, Farmhouse Salad, Chicken Salad Salad, A Wreck Salad, Mediterranean Salad and Powerhouse Salad. Customers may order any of our salads without meat for a vegetarian option and may customize a salad as they desire. Salads come with a choice of dressing, including Potbelly Vinaigrette, Balsamic Vinaigrette, Buttermilk Ranch and Non-Fat Vinaigrette. We believe our signature salads are key to diversifying our menu and help ensure that there is something for everyone at our shops.
 We offer craft your own mac and cheese with a choice of two premium toppings, including bacon, chili, Potbelly hot peppers, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers. We also offer soups, chili and side dishes, including varieties such as Broccoli Cheddar, Chicken Noodle, Loaded Baked Potato, Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Enchilada, and Tomato soup. We also have a vegan soup option, our Garden Vegetable. Our chili is hearty recipe of ground beef, kidney beans, onions and bell peppers sweetened with a touch of molasses. Additionally, customers can choose side dishes of coleslaw, macaroni salad, potato salad, potato chips or a whole dill pickle.
 Our hand-dipped shakes and smoothies are made with real ingredients and come with our signature butter cookie on the straw. Our classic shake and smoothie flavors are vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, banana, mixed berry, coffee and Oreo ®, and include real fruit. Our varieties of cookies are baked fresh in each shop daily and include Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, Sugar and Chocolate Brownie cookies. Customers can also order an ice cream sandwich, with their choice of cookies and ice cream, or our signature chocolate and caramel Dream Bar.
 Certain of our shops in areas with high early morning traffic also offer breakfast selections. As of December 30, 2018, approximately 25% of our shops offered breakfast selections. Our breakfast menu includes made-to-order breakfast sandwiches on our Flats, our signature multigrain or regular bread, or our squares and include our Mediterranean Square, Blueberry Maple Square, along with our Egg & Cheddar Cheese; Bacon, Egg & Cheddar Cheese; Sausage, Egg & Cheddar Cheese; and Ham, Mushroom, Egg & Swiss Cheese. Like our lunch and dinner sandwiches, our breakfast sandwiches are served toasty warm and any of our toppings can be added. We also offer steel cut oatmeal with toppings such as raisins, brown sugar, bananas, walnuts, apples and cranberries, and have other breakfast items available such as bagels and a custom ‘Potbelly blend’ coffee.
 Our shops use high quality ingredients such as fresh produce, which is delivered two to three times per week, and hearth-baked bread. We use all-natural white meat chicken in our sandwiches and salads. Our turkey, hickory-smoked ham and black angus roast beef are all whole-muscle meats sliced daily in our shops. Our dry-cured salami is made with fresh garlic and real red wine and we use white albacore tuna in our homemade tuna salad.
 Overall, we believe our menu of high quality food at reasonable prices offers considerable value to our customers. In fiscal 2018, our system-wide average check was approximately $8.36. 
 Customer Feedback
 We seek customer feedback on our food and operations in various ways. For example, we conduct an annual customer survey via email to learn what our customers think about us. We circulate a voluntary online survey to each customer listed in our company-wide email database, which includes email addresses obtained through our website, customer complaints and compliments, our in-shop business card drop, various social media platforms including our Facebook page and other methods. In 2018, we sent the online survey to approximately 265 thousand customers, with 13 thousand customers electing to participate. Customers who take the annual survey were entered into a drawing for a nominal Potbelly gift card. We also monitor social media channels to respond to customer feedback.
 7

We also solicit feedback via quarterly in-person “Customer Advisories” in each of our major markets of Chicago, Washington, D.C. and Dallas. At each “Customer Advisory,” certain executives and local managers meet with approximately ten customers to get feedback on our products and initiatives. The customers who participate are selected from those listed in our company-wide email database as having recently dined at Potbelly. Our marketing team strives to have participants who are representative of the diverse customers who patronize the specific shop. Customer participants in each “Customer Advisory” receive a nominal Potbelly gift card as a thank you for their participation.
 Evolution of Our Menu
 We have selectively expanded our menu offerings in response to shifts in customer tastes and demand. For example, we began offering breakfast items in 2001, Bigs and Skinnys in 2008 and Flats in 2014. We also introduced the all-veggie Mediterranean sandwich in 2012, the Mediterranean salad in 2014, the Powerhouse salad in 2016 and the Turkey Club in 2017, as well as periodic limited time offers. In 2018 we began testing, for roll-out in 2019, Pick Your Pair and Meal Deal bundling options. We believe menu innovation is a way for us to grow our business, responding to consumer trends, listening to customer feedback, and understanding customer’s needs. This innovation includes the on-going development of bundling options, craveable add-ons, and premium protein sandwiches served toasty warm from our ovens, while continuing to encourage customization and personalization by each customer.
Food Preparation and Safety
 Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources, including our supply chain team and quality assurance teams, to help ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. We have taken various steps to mitigate food quality and safety risks, including having personnel focused on this goal together with our supply chain team. Our shops undergo third-party food safety reviews, internal safety audits and routine health inspections. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers.
Shop Operations and Management
 We believe having an excellent manager in each shop is a critical factor in achieving continuous excellence in operations. Managers hire our employees, help ensure consistent execution of our menu items and strive to achieve specific targets that are evaluated on a quarterly basis. We devote significant time and resources to identifying, selecting and training our managers who plan, manage and operate their shops and who, along with our employees, provide a positive customer experience to our Potbelly fans. We believe our comprehensive processes for developing business leaders, such as our shop managers, are a key factor in driving our success.
Potbelly Operations
 Our operations are structured around the elements of People, Customers, Sales and Profits. During our peak hours of 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., our employees greet our customers and take their orders (in some shops, we take their orders while they wait in line by using a proprietary tablet system to communicate with our preparation employees). We focus on effective communication, technology and management to provide a quick and seamless experience for our customers. In addition, each shop completes quarterly tactical plans designed to help the shop achieve its targets relative to each element. In order to better assess and improve the Potbelly experience, we use a Balanced Scorecard that tracks elements such as sales and profitability metrics, employee turnover and customer satisfaction. We review overall scores locally, regionally and nationally in order to assess our operational progress and identify areas of operational focus. Attaining certain ratings on the Balanced Scorecard allows a shop to be eligible for incentive targets paid quarterly and annual merit awards.
Our People
 We look to attract, hire and retain smart, talented and outgoing people who share and demonstrate our values. We value friendly employees who engage with our customers in a genuine way to provide a personalized experience. We select employees using interview questions based on our values to determine the extent of candidate fit. All employees attend culture training classes that include team exercises and scenarios to practice utilizing the tools relative to our values of integrity, teamwork, accountability, positive energy and coaching. We strive to empower our employees to do what is right and encourage them to perform at their personal best. We believe we make expectations and accountabilities clear through our culture training and our Ethics Code of Conduct, which summarizes employee conduct guidelines and is required to be reviewed and signed by every employee upon hire and repeated annually. We believe we encourage each employee to perform at their personal best by establishing personal and professional goals through an ongoing continuous development plan. We believe the success of these programs is evident in our turnover rates and our internal promotion rates. Employees are further encouraged to perform at their personal best through an ongoing scorecard measuring system that is tied directly to a pay for performance compensation program. We believe our sustainable process to hire, train and develop our people enables us to deliver a positive customer experience. A typical Potbelly shop consists of one manager, and as many as 10 to 14 employees during our peak hours.
 8

Many of our managers live in the neighborhood in which their shop is located. We believe this allows them to get to know their customers, understand the unique character of each neighborhood and form deep roots within the community. The shop manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the shop and is required to abide by Potbelly’s operating standards. Our Management Training Program provides new managers with six to eight weeks of training that emphasizes culture, standards, strategy and procedures to prepare them for success, and is followed by on-going, in-shop coaching with their District or Market manager. Our shop managers report to District or Market Managers who typically report to a Zone Manager, and ultimately to our Chief Restaurant Operating Officer. In addition, members of senior management visit shops regularly to help ensure that our culture, strategy and quality standards are being adhered to in all aspects of our operations.
 Shop managers are responsible for selecting, hiring and training the employees for each new shop. The training period for new non-management employees lasts approximately eight weeks and is characterized by on-the-job supervision by an experienced employee. Ongoing employee training remains the responsibility of the shop manager, but, as noted above, we provide specific training for our employees around The Potbelly Advantage each year. Special emphasis is placed on the safety, consistency and quality of food preparation and service, which is monitored through ongoing coaching sessions and meetings with managers. In addition, we have other continuing communications with all of our employees on food safety and preparation standards.
 The Potbelly Experience
 We seek to deliver a positive experience for every customer at every opportunity through our tasty food, unique atmosphere and outgoing and engaging employees. We seek to staff each shop with experienced teams to ensure consistent and attentive customer service. We look to hire employees who are friendly and responsive to the needs of our customers as they assist them in selecting menu items complementing individual preferences. We strive to staff at 110% during peak hours to ensure a fast yet personal Potbelly experience for each customer, with face-to-face interaction from start to finish. We also provide off-premise services, including catering, delivery and pick-up to serve our Potbelly fans.
 We believe the combination of our great food, people and atmosphere allows Potbelly to help people love lunch again.
 Restaurant Portfolio
 As of December 30, 2018, we had a domestic base of 478 shops in 32 states and the District of Columbia. Of these, the company operates 437 shops and franchisees operate 41 shops. In addition, there are 8 international franchised shops, including 4 shops in the Middle East, 2 shops in Canada and 2 in India. 
 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we opened 10, 34 and 40 new company-operated shops, respectively, and expanded into Salt Lake City, San Antonio, El Paso, Indianapolis and Oklahoma City. Additionally, during April 2016, the Company purchased one franchise shop, converting it into a company-operated shop. In the near term we will continue to close underperforming shops and reduce our rate of company-operated shop growth. In 2019, we intend to open between 6 to 10 company-operated shops, focusing on markets where Potbelly has an established presence. 
 With an average new shop investment of approximately $600,000 and average unit volumes of approximately $1 million, which represent the average net sandwich shop sales for all shops on an annual basis, we strive to generate average shop-level profit margins, a non-GAAP measure, that range from the high teens to above 20% and cash-on-cash returns, on new company-operated shops, above 25% after two full years of operation. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will achieve and maintain similar profit margins or cash returns in the future. We are currently defining and testing our “shop of the future” which will be designed to generate strong cash flow, attractive shop-level financial results and high returns on investment.
 Site Selection and Expansion
 We consider the location of a shop to be a critical variable in its long-term success and as such, we devote significant effort to the investigation and evaluation of potential locations. We actively develop shops in both new and existing markets and plan to continue to expand in selected regions throughout the United States. Our Real Estate Committee, which includes most of our senior management team, meets twice a month to discuss all aspects of our development program. The process for selecting locations incorporates management’s experience and expertise and includes extensive data collection and analysis. We proactively seek new shop locations based on specific criteria, such as demographic characteristics, daytime population thresholds and traffic patterns, along with the potential visibility of, and accessibility to, the shop. Additionally, we use information and intelligence gathered from managers and other shop personnel that live in or near the neighborhoods we are considering. New shops are built with only one purpose in mind: to generate cash flow that meets or exceeds those modeled in our return targets. We are disciplined in our development, and we routinely forego sites that have many positive attributes, including strong visibility and street presence, but have challenging economics, such as high occupancy costs.
 9

Since we do not have standardized requirements with respect to size, shape or location, we are flexible in our site selection process. This allows us to choose and open shops with a wide variety of shapes in a wide variety of areas, including in urban central business districts and suburban areas near shopping malls or other high-traffic locations. Proposed locations are visited, reviewed and approved by key members of our Real Estate Committee.
 Shop Design
 We strive to create a unique customer experience that delivers a neighborhood feel for each shop. We typically design the interior of our shops in-house, utilizing outside architects when necessary. Our design team sources most furnishings and decorations for our shops. Each of our shops features vintage décor and shared design elements, such as the use of wood, wallpaper motifs and our signature Potbelly stove. Consistent with The Potbelly Advantage, our shops display locally-themed photos and other decorative items inspired by the neighborhood. Our shop size averages approximately 2,300 square feet; however, we currently target shop sizes between 1,800 and 2,500 square feet for new openings. The dining area of a typical shop can seat anywhere from 40 to 60 people. Some of our shops incorporate larger dining areas and outdoor patios. We believe the unique atmosphere and local music creates a lively place where friends and family can get together, encourages repeat visits by our customers and drives increased sales.
Construction
 Construction of a new shop generally takes approximately 50 to 80 days from the date the location is leased or under contract, fully permitted and the landlord has delivered the space to Potbelly. Each new shop requires a total cash investment of approximately $600,000, but this figure could be materially higher or lower depending on the market, shop size and condition of the premises upon landlord delivery. We generally construct shops in third-party leased retail space but also construct free-standing buildings on leased properties. In the future, we intend to continue converting existing third-party leased retail space or constructing new shops in the majority of circumstances. For additional information regarding our leases, see “—Properties” in Item 2.
Franchising
 In 2010, we initiated a program to selectively franchise our shops to take advantage of incremental growth opportunities. We intend to expand the number of franchise shops on a disciplined basis as we further develop our franchise program. As of December 30, 2018, we had 41 domestic franchised shops in 9 states. 
 In 2011, our first international franchise shop opened with Alshaya, our first international franchise partner. As of December 30, 2018, Alshaya operated 4 franchised shops in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and has exclusive franchising rights in the Middle East. Our agreement with Alshaya provides that Alshaya may also open shops in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In 2015, we entered into a franchise development agreement with Halsted, pursuant to which Halsted has the exclusive right to develop Potbelly shops in the province of Ontario, Canada for a period of ten years. The first Potbelly shop in Toronto, Ontario opened in October 2016. As of December 30, 2018, Halsted operated two franchise shops in Ontario, Canada. We do not anticipate Halsted to open additional Potbelly shops in Canada. In 2017 we entered into a franchise development agreement with Kwals, pursuant to which Kwals has the exclusive rights to develop Potbelly shops in certain states in India. The first Potbelly shop in Delhi, India, opened in December 2017.
 We look for franchisees who love working with a team and have solid business experience, financial qualifications and personal motivation. Our franchise arrangements grant third parties a license to establish and operate a shop using our systems and our trademarks. The franchisee pays us for the ideas, strategy, marketing, operating system, training, purchasing power and brand recognition. All new U.S. franchisees participate in an eight to twelve-week training program consisting of real life experience in our company-operated shops, as well as training at our Potbelly Support Center in Chicago. Franchised shops must be operated in compliance with our methods, standards and specifications, regarding menu items, ingredients, materials, supplies, services, fixtures, furnishings, décor and signs. Although we do not expect franchise activities to result in significant revenue in the near term, we see the selective expansion of our franchising efforts to be a valuable potential growth opportunity over time.
 Advertising and Marketing
 We believe our shops appeal to a broad base of loyal customers for our great food and fun environment staffed by friendly people. With our current marketing strategy we have devoted more resources to marketing. Our methods of marketing and advertising promote and maintain the Potbelly brand image and, among other things, generate awareness of shop locations and brand differentiation.

Advertising
 We promote our shops through media in markets in which we have scale. The uses of digital and outdoor media are the most common advertising vehicles used in these markets. Additionally, we rely on in-shop materials to communicate and market to our customers
Digital Marketing
 We have increased our use of digital marketing tools, which enable us to reach a significant number of people in a timely and targeted fashion at a fraction of the cost of traditional media. We believe that our customers are frequent internet users and will use social media to make dining decisions or to share dining experiences. We have a Facebook page, Instagram and Twitter feed and advertise on various social media and other websites. We also use our Potbelly App and Potbelly Perks loyalty program to communicate with our customers and personalize offers for them, where they can order ahead, pay with their phone and earn tasty treats.
Neighborhood Shop Marketing
 Consistent with our neighborhood approach, a portion of our marketing investments are made at the shop level. Neighborhood shops hold a variety of community events, including fundraisers. For example, during a “Shake Fundraiser” for smaller community organizations, Potbelly donates a portion of sales for each customized milkshake sold. For larger organizations, Potbelly sponsors local cause fundraisers, where 25% of sales gathered at the event are donated to the organization’s cause. Our shops promote these events and other events through social media, public relations, in-shop materials and local support, which results in increased traffic. Additionally, we engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as contributing food, time and money to charitable, civic and cultural programs in order to give back to the communities we serve and increase public awareness and appreciation of our shops and our employees.
Sourcing and Supply Chain
 Our supply chain team sources, negotiates and purchases food supplies for our shops. We believe in using high quality ingredients while maintaining our value position in the marketplace. We benchmark our products against the competition using consumer panels. We contract with Distribution Market Advantage, Inc., or DMA, a cooperative of multiple food distributors located throughout the nation. DMA is a broker with whom we negotiate and gain access to third-party food distributors and suppliers. For fiscal year 2018, distributors through our DMA arrangement supplied us with approximately 95% of our food supplies through six primary distributors: Reinhart FoodService, L.L.C., Ben E. Keith Company, Food Services of America, Shamrock Foods, Gordon Food Service and Nicholas & Co. Our remaining food supplies are distributed by other distributors under separate contracts. Our distributors deliver supplies to our shops approximately two to three times per week.
 We negotiate pricing and volume terms directly with certain of our suppliers and distributors or through DMA. Our supply chain team utilizes a mix of forward pricing protocols for certain items under which we agree with our supplier on fixed prices for deliveries at some time in the future, fixed pricing protocols under which we agree on a fixed price with our supplier for the duration of that protocol, and formula pricing protocols under which the prices we pay are based on a specified formula related to the prices of the goods, such as spot prices. Our use of any forward pricing arrangements varies substantially from time to time and these arrangements tend to cover relatively short periods (i.e., typically 12 months or less).
 Currently we have pricing arrangements of varying lengths with our distributors and suppliers, including distributors and suppliers of meats, dairy, bread, cookie dough and other products. Meats represent about 26% of our product purchasing composition. In fiscal year 2018, more than 90% of our meat products were sourced from 10 suppliers under non-exclusive contracts. We have a non-exclusive contract with Campagna-Turano Bakery, Inc. for our signature multigrain bread. Campagna-Turano Bakery, Inc. produces bread items in a primary and secondary production facility. We have secondary suppliers in place for many of our significant meats, and we believe we would be able to source our meat and bread requirements from different suppliers if doing so became necessary. However, changes in the price or availability of certain products may affect the profitability of certain items, our ability to maintain existing prices and our ability to purchase sufficient amounts of items to satisfy our customers’ demands.
 Many of our products, ingredients and supplies are currently sourced from multiple suppliers. Additionally, our supply chain team has established contingency plans for many key products. For example, manufacturers of certain products maintain alternative production facilities capable of satisfying our requirements should the primary facility experience interruptions. For other products, we believe we have identified alternate suppliers that could meet our requirements at competitive prices or, in some cases, have identified a product match that could be used in our shops. Our supply chain team regularly updates our procurement strategies to include contingency plans for new products and ingredients, as well as additional secondary and alternate suppliers. We believe these strategies would collectively enable us to obtain sufficient product quantities from other sources at competitive prices without material disruption should a current supplier be unable to fulfill its commitment to us.

Management Information Systems
 Shop-level financial and accounting controls are handled through a point-of-sale computer system and network in each shop that communicates with our corporate headquarters. The POS system is also used to authorize and transmit credit card sales transactions and to manage the business and control costs, such as labor. Our company-operated shops are connected through data centers and a portal to provide our corporate employees with access to business information and tools that allow them to collaborate, communicate, train and share information between shops and the corporate office. We believe our systems currently comply with all credit card industry security standards for processing of credit and gift cards.
Competition
 We compete in the restaurant industry, primarily in the limited-service restaurant segment but also with restaurants in the full-service restaurant segment, and face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants, convenience stores and other outlets on a national, regional and local level. We believe that we compete primarily based on product quality, restaurant concept, service, convenience, value perception and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings and open new units. Although new competitors may emerge at any time due to the low barriers to entry, our competitors include: Chipotle, Jimmy John’s, Panera Bread and Subway, among others. Additionally, we compete with limited-service restaurants, specialty restaurants and other retail concepts for prime shop locations.
Government Regulation
 We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our shops is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which may include, among others, health and safety, nutritional menu labeling, health care, environmental and fire agencies in the state, municipality or country in which the shop is located. Difficulty in obtaining or failing to obtain the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new shop in a particular area. Additionally, difficulties or inabilities to retain or renew licenses, or increased compliance costs due to changed regulations, could adversely affect operations at existing shops.
 Our shop operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws, including the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act and the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, governing such matters as minimum wages, overtime and worker conditions. Significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and further increases in the minimum wage or other changes in these laws could increase our labor costs. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increasing menu prices will depend on the responses of our competitors and customers. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.
 We and our franchisees may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) enacted in March 2010 requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations in the United States to comply with federal nutritional disclosure requirements. The FDA issued final regulations with regard to restaurant menu labeling that became effective May 7, 2018. A number of states, counties and cities have also enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose additional nutritional information to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. While our ability to adapt to consumer preferences is a strength of our concepts, the effect of such labeling requirements on consumer choices, if any, is unclear at this time.
 We and our franchisees are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act (the “ADA”), which, among other things, requires our shops to meet federally mandated requirements for the disabled. The ADA prohibits discrimination in employment and public accommodations on the basis of disability. Under the ADA, we and our franchisees could be required to expend funds to modify our shops to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for the employment of, disabled persons. In addition, our employment practices are subject to the requirements of the Immigration and Naturalization Service relating to citizenship and residency. Government regulations could affect and change the items we procure for resale. We and our franchisees may also become subject to legislation or regulation seeking to tax and/or regulate sugary beverages and high-fat and high-sodium foods, particularly in the United States, which could be costly to comply with. Our results can be impacted by tax legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and by accounting standards or pronouncements.
 We and our franchisees are also subject to laws and regulations relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments, gift cards and consumer credit, protection and fraud, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.

Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rule and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the FDD with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We believe that our FDDs, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the FTC franchise rule and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.
 See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation of our business.
 Seasonality
 Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, customer spending patterns for our established shops are lowest in the first quarter of the year due to holidays, consumer habits and adverse weather. Our quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new shop openings and their associated pre-opening costs. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
Employees
 As of December 30, 2018, we employed approximately 7,000 persons, of which approximately 200 are corporate personnel, 600 are shop management personnel and the remainder are hourly shop personnel.
 Intellectual Property and Trademarks
 We regard our “Potbelly” and “Potbelly Sandwich Works” trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our shops. We have also obtained trademarks for several of our other menu items, such as “A Wreck,” and for various advertising slogans, including “Good Vibes, Great Sandwiches,” “Feed Your Smile” and “A First Class Dive.” We are aware of names and marks similar to the trademarks of ours used by other persons in certain geographic areas in which we have shops. However, we believe such uses will not adversely affect us. Our policy is to pursue registration of our intellectual property whenever possible and to oppose vigorously any infringement thereof.
 We license the use of our registered trademarks to franchisees through franchise arrangements. The franchise arrangements restrict franchisees’ activities with respect to the use of our trademarks and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the trademarks.
