Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “DBMM”, “DBMM Group”, the “Company”) f/k/a RTG Ventures, Inc. (“RTG”) is an OTC:PK listed company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Florida on September 29, 1998.
 
On March 20, 2007, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Atlantic Network Holdings Limited, New Media Television (Europe) Limited (“NMTV”), and Certain Outside Stockholders to acquire all of the outstanding shares of NMTV. Atlantic Network Holdings Limited is a Guernsey company limited by shares and NMTV is a United Kingdom private company limited by shares. The transaction was subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, including the satisfactory completion of the audit of NMTV’s financial statements for each of its past three fiscal years. The conditions of closing were not met by ANHL and the agreement was rescinded via 8-K/A on March 30, 2010.
 
DBMM entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”), on March 31, 2010, with Cloud Channel Limited which was subsequently re-named as RTG Ventures (Europe) Limited in July 2010 (“RTG Ventures (Europe)”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding capital stock of RTG Ventures (Europe) from its stockholders for consideration consisting of Convertible Preferred Shares of RTG Ventures, Inc. according to the derivative valuation methodologies outlined in the Share Exchange Agreement of Stylar Limited, a/k/a Digital Clarity. RTG Ventures (Europe) has been valued 12 months forward “notionally” one year hence. An 8-K/A was filed in September 2010 containing audited financials of the acquisition of Stylar Limited which completed the transaction. Shareholders converted the preferred shares into common stock using the average share price of the 30

days preceding September 3, 2011 which provided a share price of $0.016083. The methodology provided a valuation of 4X net profit. All preferred stock was held by DBMM’s transfer agent for the 12-month period ending September 3, 2011. All voting shares were held by management.
 
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year 2011 following substantial investment, the Company conducted a structural review of its total product and services offering. The review was carried out by the Board of Directors. The result was to bring technology development being outsourced directly into the Company to steward on a daily basis and any activities which were not revenue generating in the near term were eliminated. Certain business lines were eliminated from the Business Plan immediately. In October 2011 the joint venture with iPayu was mutually withdrawn and in December 2011 the acquisition of Bitemark Ltd. was rescinded. The companies reverted to the same position each held prior to the contracts.
 
The rescission of the Bitemark Ltd. share purchase agreement was included as an exhibit to the filing for the 2011 fiscal year even though it constituted a subsequent event at the time.
 
As a further result of the review, the Company also agreed to strategically focus on developing the business of its wholly owned and revenue generating online marketing services company, Digital Clarity. With deep DNA in its operating market, blending the services of an experienced professional workforce, leveraging a technology offering positions the Company in a strong, forward looking structure. Digital Clarity operates in the growing area of digital marketing that helps companies make the most of the digital economy focusing on areas such as Search Page Engine Marketing (Google, Yahoo! & Bing),
 
Social Media (Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn) and Internet Strategy Planning including Design, Analytics and Mobile Marketing.
 
On March 5, 2013, Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc. filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to change its name from “RTG Ventures, Inc.” to “Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc.” In connection with the name change, the Company’s trading symbol changed from “RTGV” to “DBMM” (the “Symbol Change”). The Amendment was effective as of March 20, 2013. The Name Change and Symbol Change have been reflected in the Company’s ticker symbol as of April 8, 2013.
 
Also on March 5, 2013, Digital Brand Media & Marketing Group, Inc. received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its 100 to 1 reverse stock split.

Pay per Click Advertising (PPC)
 
Pay per click (PPC) (also called Cost per click) is an Internet advertising model used to direct traffic to websites, where advertisers pay the publisher (typically a website owner) when the ad is clicked. With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market. Content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system. PPC “display” advertisements are shown on web sites with related content that have agreed to show ads.
 
Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
 
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility of a website or a web page in search engines via the “natural” or un-paid (“organic” or “algorithmic”) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines.

Leading internet authority, Jayson DeMers, founder & CEO of AudienceBloom, a Seattle-based content marketing & social media agency said recently, " The SEO industry is worth $65 billion; will it ever stop growing?".
 
What’s more, is that research company Borell Associates is predicting that the SEO industry will continue to grow to an estimated $72 billion by 2018 and $79 billion by 2020.
 
Mobile ad revenues were $8.2 billion or just under +30%. Most significantly, the lion’s share of this unprecedented growth was driven by Paid Search.
 
Digital Clarity has made considerable inroads in both Search and Social Media. The growth in expectations, by users and well as how Google ranks, means UEO or user experience optimization has become almost synonymous with SEO. Google has started to show clear favoritism towards sites with fast load times, mobile optimization, and indications that users are enjoying their overall experience.
 
Analytics
 
The measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of internet data for purposes of understanding and optimizing web usage.
 
Email Marketing
 
Description: Email marketing is a form of direct marketing which uses email as a means of communicating commercial or fund-raising messages to an audience. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing.
 
SMS Marketing
 
Users of an SMS service can exchange text messages either from mobile to mobile or through a specialist internet website to a handset about anything from promotional offers, to general information regarding a product or service. Messages are usually sent using a short code system. Short codes are around 5 or 6 digits in length and work by asking customers to text a certain keyword to a specific code. E.g. ‘Text WIN to 84841”.
 
Web Design & Development
 
To lead a highly competitive environment, the process of planning and creating a website requires both art and technology prowess. Text, images, digital media and interactive elements are used by Digital Clarity’s designers to produce the page seen on the web browser. As a whole, the process of web design can include conceptualization, planning, producing, post-production, research, and advertising. The site itself can be divided into pages. The site is navigated by using hyperlinks; commonly these are blue and underlined but can be made to look like anything the client wishes.
