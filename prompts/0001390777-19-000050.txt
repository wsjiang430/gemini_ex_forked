Supervision and Regulation
Information on the supervision and regulation of BNY Mellon can be found in the “MD&A – Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Competition
BNY Mellon is subject to competition in all aspects and areas of our business. Our Investment Services business competes with domestic and international financial services firms that offer custody services, corporate trust services, clearing services, collateral management services, credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and cash management services and related products, as well as a wide range of technology service providers, such as financial services data processing firms. Our Investment Management business competes with domestic and international asset management firms, hedge funds, investment banking companies and other financial services companies, including trust banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies, as well as a wide range of technology service providers. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, technological innovation and expertise, price, reputation, rates, lending limits and customer convenience.
Many of our competitors, with the particular exception of financial holding companies, banks and trust companies, are not subject to regulation as extensive as that described under the “MD&A — Supervision and Regulation” section in the Annual Report and, as a result, may have a competitive advantage over us and our subsidiaries in certain respects.
Many broad-based financial services firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage and asset management, which may enhance their competitive position. 


We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees, and must compete with institutions whose compensatory arrangements are not subject to the same regulatory and supervisory frameworks that apply to us. For further discussion see “MD&A — Risk Factors – Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain employees” in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As part of our business strategy, we seek to distinguish ourselves from competitors by the level of service we deliver to our clients. We also believe that technological innovation is an important competitive factor, and, for this reason, have made and continue to make substantial investments in this area. 
The ability to maintain operations during unexpected events and to recover quickly from unexpected events is a competitive factor. We continue to evaluate and strengthen our business continuity and operational resiliency capabilities and have increased our investments in technology to steadily enhance those capabilities, including our ability to resume and sustain our operations.
For additional discussion regarding competition, see “MD&A — Risk Factors – We are subject to competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability” in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
Employees
At Dec. 31, 2018, BNY Mellon and its subsidiaries had approximately 51,300 full-time employees.
