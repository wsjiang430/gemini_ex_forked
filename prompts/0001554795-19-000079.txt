Item 1. Description of Business
General
 
TimefireVR Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our” the “Company” and “Timefire”) is a Nevada corporation, which was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on February 16, 1984. On November 21, 2016, we changed our name to TimefireVR Inc.
Sale of Our Existing Business
 
Effective September 13, 2016, the Company acquired Timefire, LLC (“TLLC”), a Phoenix-based virtual reality content developer which was an Arizona limited liability company. As consideration for the acquisition, the Company issued the equity holders of TLLC a total of 41,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock and 2,800,000 five-year warrants, which constituted a change of control of the Company (the “Merger”).
 
On January 3, 2018, the Company effected the sale of TLLC to a group which included its former owners including two of our former executive officers and directors. The Company received: (i) $100,000 in cash and (ii) a secured promissory note in the principal amount of $120,000 bearing 6% annual interest that matured in September 2018. The promissory note is in default. Additionally, the buyers of TLLC assumed certain of the Company’s liabilities totaling $510,599. The Company’s business model in the virtual reality business was not successful and the Company was unable to continue to finance its business due to a loss of confidence in the virtual reality business by the Company’s investors and threats of resignation from the Company’s officers, directors and lead technologist and TLLC employees. While shareholder approval was required by Nevada law, the purchasers refused to fund TLLC unless we closed immediately. Certain investors that had financed the Company had agreed to provide further funding if we sold TLLC and received a release from key liabilities including past due promissory notes. Rather than cease operations and have no working capital, we adhered to the TLLC purchasers' demands and closed the sale. Pending finalization of the sale of TLLC over the year-end holidays, these investors lent us approximately $669,000 on December 22, 2017 and cancelled past due notes held by the investors on January 3, 2018 as explained in the following paragraph. Because we needed to eliminate state law liabilities, we opted to get irrevocable proxies which would permit us to seek shareholder ratification. On November 29, 2018, a majority of the shares of common stock voting for the proposal ratified that sale of TLLC at a shareholders meeting.
 
As described below, in 2018 we entered the cryptocurrency mining business which business we continue to engage in despite the very sharp decline in the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which has negatively impacted the mining business.
 
Effective January 3, 2018, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange”) with certain of the Company’s investors pursuant to which the Company issued 303,714 shares of the Company’s new Convertible Series E Preferred Stock in exchange for the cancellation of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, Senior Convertible Notes issued March 3, 2017, Senior Convertible Notes issued August 21, 2017, and certain of the Company’s outstanding Warrants. This Exchange had the effect of simplifying our capital structure and eliminating past due secured debt while substantially increasing future potential dilution. Effective December 21, 2017, we closed a private placement with our principal investors in which we borrowed $668,750 and issued the investors $703,747.38 in 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes which Notes were due January 18, 2018, convertible at $0.03 per share and pay 8% per annum interest. The short-term nature was designed to ensure the TLLC sale closed in early January. On March 6, 2018, we borrowed $1 million from these same investors and issued them $1,052,632 new 5% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the "March Notes") which are due on April 15, 2019. The March Notes pay 8% per annum interest and are convertible at $0.03 per share. On the maturity date, we must pay 120% of the principal of the March Notes. The March Notes are secured by a first lien on the Company's assets. For information on the warrants we issued, see Item 8 “Financial Statements” Note 10. Also on March 6, 2018, the investors extended their other Convertible Notes to April 15, 2019.
 
In August 2018, we borrowed an additional $150,000 issuing an investor a $156,250 8% convertible note due April 15, 2019. This note is convertible at $0.03 per share (well above current market) and upon maturity is payable at a 120% premium. On November 21, 2018, we borrowed $75,000 and issued the investor a $75,000 5% promissory note which was due February 19, 2019 and is in default.
 
Proposed Acquisition
 
We do not have the capital to pay these obligations when due and have been unable to raise further capital on any terms to support our current business. Further, while we have been engaged in the mining of cryptocurrency as described in “Summary of 2018 Developments” below, we have an oral understanding to acquire a drone and blockchain company based in Puerto Rico (the “Target”). As of the date of this Report, we do not have any written term sheet or other agreements with regard to this proposed acquisition. If we and the Target can each obtain the necessary financing, the equity owners of the Target will own approximately 83.3% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis and our shareholders shall own the balance. Among other things, all of our outstanding preferred stock and indebtedness will be required to convert into either common stock or another series of preferred stock with no preferences or limitations other than a 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation. If we close the proposed acquisition with the Target, we are required to have no accounts payable or indebtedness except ordinary course liabilities which have not yet come due. Further, the Target must have at least $1 million of unrestricted cash and no liabilities except ordinary course liabilities which have not come due. Our Chief Executive Officer will remain a director of the Company and upon closing of the acquisition the Target will be entitled to designate three members to our board of directors subject to compliance with Rule 14f-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Further, our Chief Executive Officer shall become a consultant to the Company for a six-month period following the closing. As described later in this Report, our Chief Executive Officer reduced his compensation to $5,000 per month effective March 1, 2019 and has become a full-time executive of another corporation. See Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
 
Because of all these contingencies, there can be no assurances that we will close any transaction with the Target or obtain the necessary financing. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Summary of 2018 Developments
 
On January 3, 2018, we announced our entry into the cryptocurrency business. In order to enter the cryptocurrency mining business, we entered into an Advisory Agreement with two parties on March 16, 2018. Under the Advisory Agreement, the parties provided consulting services to us concerning cryptocurrency mining and other opportunities in the cryptocurrency business. The parties to the Advisory Agreement also provided us with an engineer who will provide half-time services to us in the mining business under which he will provide logistical advice and mining oversight including designing, and building overhead operating proprietary software, and monitoring operations of the mining systems. Under the Advisory Agreement, we agreed to reimburse one party $5,000 per month for the services of the mining engineer. Assuming we entered into the mining business within 90 days, we agreed to pay a sales royalty as additional consideration. Further we issued 6,666,666 shares of common stock which will vest quarterly subject to the Advisory Agreement remaining in effect on each applicable vesting date and an additional 6,666,666 three-year warrants exercisable at $0.05 with the same vesting provisions. We terminated the Advisory Agreement effective December 15, 2018.
Our Bitcoin Mining Business
 
In late March 2018 we entered into a co-location arrangement with an unaffiliated third party in the mining business. We ordered high speed computer servers and in the Spring after delivery of the servers, initiated our mining of Bitcoin. The intent of this purchase and location was to allow us to solidify, test and validate our hardware and software operating systems prior to expanding our mining operations.  See the general discussion of mining beginning on page 5 of this Report.
 
In December 2018, we sold large mining servers (representing 80% of our mining capacity) in order to provide the working capital to remain operational. Our remaining servers are being operated to mine Bitcoin by a co-location company that we have used since we entered the mining business in 2018. For their services from March 21 through December 31, 2019, we owe this company $15,000 and have agreed to net the amount against the balance they owe us for their purchase of the miners.
 
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has acquired and sold Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. In our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we disclosed negotiations to acquire Cryptogram, LLC. Those discussions terminated in Spring 2018.
 
Bitcoins and the Bitcoin Network
 
A Bitcoin is one type of cryptocurrency that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security that is known as the “Bitcoin Network.” The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public transaction ledger, known as the “Blockchain,” and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoins can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar. Bitcoins are the initial and leading cryptocurrency and therefore offer the greatest mining opportunity.
 
Bitcoin transactions and ownership are recorded and reflected on the digital transaction ledger known as the “Blockchain,” which is a digital file stored in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoins in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns them. Users keep their Bitcoins in an electronic computer file known as a digital wallet.
 
The Bitcoin Network is decentralized and does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoins. Rather, Bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule.
 
Overview of the Bitcoin Network’s Operations
 
In order to own, transfer or use Bitcoins, a person generally must have internet access to connect to the Bitcoin Network. Bitcoin transactions between parties occur very rapidly (within several seconds) and may be made directly between end-users without the need for a third-party intermediary, although there are entities that provide third-party intermediary services. To prevent the possibility of double-spending a single Bitcoin, a user must notify the Bitcoin Network of the transaction by broadcasting the transaction data to its network peers. The Bitcoin Network provides confirmation against double-spending by memorializing every transaction in the Blockchain, which is publicly accessible and transparent. This memorialization and verification against double-spending is accomplished through the Bitcoin mining process, which adds “blocks” of data, including recent transaction information, to the Blockchain.
Transaction Verification (Mining)
 
The process by which Bitcoins are “mined” results in new blocks being added to the Blockchain and new Bitcoins being issued to the miners. Miners engage in a set of prescribed complex mathematical calculations in order to add a block to the Blockchain and thereby confirm Bitcoin transactions included in that block’s data. Miners that are successful in adding a block to the Blockchain are automatically awarded a fixed number of Bitcoins for their effort; we also refer to this process of receiving the aforementioned award as transaction verification services. This reward system is the method by which new Bitcoins enter into circulation to the public and is accomplished in the added block through the notation of the new Bitcoin creation and their allocation to the successful miner’s digital wallet. To begin mining, a user can download and run Bitcoin Network mining software, which, like regular Bitcoin Network software programs, turns the user’s computer into a “node” on the Bitcoin Network that validates blocks. Due to the enhanced investor interest in Bitcoin, there has been large increases in, and a scarcity of, computer servers needed for mining. Additionally, since these high-speed servers use vast amounts of electricity, there has been a spike in the prices of electricity in the areas where mining has been prevalent. These areas were selected for their then low prices. The “poster boy or girl” for mining is Bitcoin mining which uses huge amounts of electricity to operate the computer servers. Miners sought out areas where electric power was relatively inexpensive. This has caused electricity prices to spike in these areas. Locations such as East Wenatchee, Washington have witnessed a swell in occupants and business as miners relocate to areas with cheap electricity. The mining industry has witnessed a change from small miners operating from their homes to large mining “farms” operated by companies with substantial capital, computer resources and other capabilities and competitive advantages. As electricity prices have risen as a result of mining, local officials have become alarmed because area residents are forced to pay more for their electricity. Last year, Plattsburg, NY banned certain aspects of mining.

Alternative cryptocurrencies
 
Bitcoins are not the only type of cryptocurrency founded on math-based algorithms and cryptographic security, although it was considered the most prominent as of March 2018. Over 1,500 other cryptocurrencies, have been developed since the Bitcoin Network’s inception, including Ether, Ripple, Litecoin, Dash, and Monero. The Bitcoin Network, however, possesses the “first-to-market” advantage and thus far has captured the majority of the industry’s market share and is secured by a mining network with significantly more processing power than that of any other cryptocurrency. The Company is examining and will continue to examine these other cryptocurrencies, subject to financing, existing market conditions and regulatory compliance.
 
In 2017, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experienced substantial price increases particularly in the late fall with extreme volatility beginning in the second half of December:
 
As the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose, the speculative fever brought substantial competition to the business both from established companies, early stage entrants and bad actors. The effect was to make existing and new businesses much more expensive due to the growing demand and relatively limited supply. Since 2018, the market for cryptocurrency has been weak. As a result, the Company began exploring other opportunities since the cryptocurrency mining business on a limited basis with current market prices is not feasible for a public company encumbered by the overhead that cannot be eliminated.
 
Competition
 
In the mining business, we face substantial competition and a myriad of other risks. We have one part-time contractor, our Chief Executive Officer, who oversees our mining activities and relatively limited financial and other resources. See the “Risk Factors” that are at the end of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk Factors.”
Cryptocurrency
 
The Company’s cryptocurrency initiatives compete with other industry participants that focus on investing in and mining of Bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Company’s control, currently make the cryptocurrency business unattractive. Companies have raised substantial capital seeking to enter the cryptocurrency business. Our lack of capital is a competitive disadvantage.
Mining
 
The business of mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency is extremely competitive. Over the last several years as costs have spiked and the price of Bitcoin increased, large sources of capital have entered the mining business. This factor, as well as the prior experience and technical capabilities of our competitors, puts us at a competitive disadvantage.
Employees 
 
We have no employees and two contractors, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer who offer part-time services.
 
Regulation
 
Because we will buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrency, we are subject to numerous federal and state laws around the world regarding cryptocurrency. The scope of these regulations are continuing to evolve, and they may be inconsistent among the locations in which we operate and our users reside. Compliance with these rules may be difficult and costly, and if we fail to comply, we could face liability under these statutes and legal or administrative actions by government entities and private litigants. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Factors” below, for further discussion of the risks we face.
Facilities
 
See Item 2. “Description of Property.”
