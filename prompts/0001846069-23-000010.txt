Item 1. Business 
Overview
At Nextdoor, our purpose is to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on. Nextdoor is the neighborhood network that connects neighborhood stakeholders, including neighbors, businesses and public services, online and in real life to build stronger, more vibrant, and resilient neighborhoods. As of December 31, 2022, Nextdoor was in more than 305,000 neighborhoods around the world and in 1 in 3 households in the United States, and during the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached 78 million global Verified Neighbors1. Nextdoor is built on the power of hyperlocal community. Neighbors and organizations, which include small and mid-sized businesses, large brands, public agencies, and nonprofits, around the world turn to Nextdoor to receive trusted information, give and get help, and build real-world connections with neighborhood stakeholders.
Nextdoor began in the United States, and as of December 31, 2022, our platform was available in 11 countries. Beyond the United States, Nextdoor supports neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and Denmark. In the United Kingdom, as of December 31, 2022, Nextdoor was in 1 in 4 households, and 1 in 3 households in London. We intend to expand our neighbor footprint globally and to increasingly become a weekly use case for neighbors. 
Value for Neighbors and Organizations
Value for Neighbors
Neighbors come to Nextdoor to connect to the neighborhoods that matter to them so they can belong. We leverage technology to enable online and real-world connections between neighbors and organizations — both of which are a valuable part of the neighborhood ecosystem. Nextdoor ensures neighbors are connected to real people by requiring neighbors to use their real name and address, which fosters a trusted environment so they can meet and learn more about those nearby. Further, since the experience is based on geographical location, Nextdoor uniquely provides a way to bring online connections into the real world. 
Value for Organizations
Nextdoor connects neighbors with each other and everything nearby, including organizations. Organizations are essential for building strong, vibrant neighborhoods and are a trusted and core member of the community. Businesses of all sizes and types come to Nextdoor to build their reputation and reach their customers in meaningful ways and to encourage action through hyperlocal targeting and personalization of advertising at scale. Public agencies come to Nextdoor to deliver critical information to neighbors with hyperlocal distribution. Businesses and public agencies also leverage Nextdoor to find out what is important to the neighbors in the local community and to communicate with them directly. This includes keeping neighbors apprised about everything from local events, such as restaurant launches and street fairs, to empowering businesses to build their reputation in their local communities. Nextdoor helps public agencies create meaningful connections with the neighborhoods they serve by enabling them to provide timely updates, and alerts and tips to stay safe and protected during times of crisis, such as power outages, storms, or wildfires.
Our Platform
Nextdoor’s product strategy fulfills our purpose by enabling neighbors and organizations to build an “Active Valued Community” — an engaged community of neighbors, businesses and public services that you can trust and depend on to exchange valuable information, goods, and services. Nextdoor is a high-utility platform, offering distinct functionalities and experiences for neighbors and organizations alike. 
How neighbors discover what's happening nearby 
•Newsfeed: The Newsfeed is where neighbors find constantly updated posts, discussions, photos, and links from other neighbors and organizations. Neighbors can respond by commenting or adding a reaction (e.g., like, thank, and wow), and can set their feed preferences (e.g., rank by top posts, recent activity, recent posts, or popular everywhere). 
•Discover: The Discover tab and improved navigation bar, both launched in the second quarter of 2022, complement the Newsfeed and allow neighbors to find nearby Groups, neighbors, businesses and Events nearby, leveraging a nativized maps surface designed to promote on-platform to off-platform interaction.
1 Verified Neighbors are individuals who have joined Nextdoor and completed the verification process for their account.
•Notifications: In-app and Email Notifications inform neighbors about news, items, and activities they are interested in. Notifications include everything from trending posts to direct messages about items for sale to alerts by local public agencies. Notifications keep neighbors updated and drive increased engagement on Nextdoor.
•Search: Search gives neighbors the ability to find specific content and organizations (including large brands, small businesses, public agencies, and nonprofits) related to their neighborhood. Nextdoor’s search combines an understanding of search terms with filtering capabilities to get neighbors the results they are looking for.
How neighbors connect with organizations and find local resources 
•Businesses: Neighbors use Nextdoor to discover spots most-loved by locals, leave recommendations, find exclusive deals and promotions, and interact with businesses. In the third quarter of 2022, we launched Faves to allow neighbors to connect with and follow their favorite local businesses.
•For Sale & Free: For Sale & Free is our truly local marketplace where neighbors buy, sell, or give away items, and offer services such as babysitting and dog walking. 
•Public Services: On Nextdoor, neighbors can receive critical, real-time information from trusted officials. Public agencies, including government entities and service providers, turn to Nextdoor directly, quickly, and easily reach neighbors in their community with hyperlocal information and alerts.
How neighbors connect with other neighbors 
•Posts, Comments, and Reactions: Through posts, comments, and reactions neighbors can reach out to the neighborhood to get and give information that is locally relevant, trusted, and in real time. Whether it is for a local plumber or a family friendly pizza place, neighbors know best.
•Connections: Connections are how neighbors can find and keep up with other neighbors they know and care about. When neighbors connect with each other, they will see each other’s posts, comments, and reactions highlighted in their feeds and have the ability to @mention them in posts and comments. The Neighbors You May Know feature recommends neighbors to connect with based on proximity, Connections in common, on-platform interactions, and personal contacts. 
•Groups: Neighbors can create Groups to connect with those nearby with a common interest. 
•Messaging: Neighbors can contact other neighbors and organizations through direct messaging (e.g., neighbors messaging businesses, coordinating a time to pick up a desk, to borrow a printer, or get more information about a tutor).
Our Advertising Solutions
Nextdoor offers differentiated advertising solutions in a unique local context that allows advertisers of all sizes to reach the right neighbor, at the right time, with the right message. Nextdoor helps advertisers drive measurable outcomes by creating meaningful connections with a uniquely engaged local audience. Advertisers come to Nextdoor to connect to neighborhoods everywhere, delivering hyperlocal advertising at scale.
Advertisers can engage with their customers in multiple surfaces on our platform, including:
•Newsfeed: Advertisers can run ads in the Newsfeed to build awareness, to become part of the consideration set for a consumer’s purchase, and to create a direct response to an explicit call to action (e.g., visit our newly opened store). Ads are featured prominently where neighbors first look for what is happening on Nextdoor. Ads can also be customized (e.g., with neighborhood name and store location) to make them even more relevant.
•In-App Digest and Email Digest: Advertisers can also use ads in the In-App Digest and Email Digest to create awareness among neighbors who turn to their summary of top posts. Ads are highly visible, and neighborhood names and store locations can be customized by neighborhood.
•For Sale & Free: Advertisers can leverage ads in For Sale & Free to drive action such as shop now. Our local marketplace is where neighbors with high intent to buy will go. Ads are given a top spot in this contextually relevant space with the opportunity to customize by neighborhood.
Our ad formats, including sponsored posts, sponsored emails, and local deals, feature combinations of text (static or dynamic), images (including static, animated, or video), audio, and URL links, and can be leveraged on multiple surfaces of our platform. We are 
continually improving and building upon our library of ad formats and the ways in which advertisers can purchase and deliver ads across our platform.
Ad Auction
Ads on the Nextdoor platform primarily compete via an auction-based system. Our ad auction allows us to serve ads to neighbors when and where it matters most. Our auction system selects the best ad for each available ad impression, based on the likelihood of a desired action occurring and how much that action is worth to advertisers. The likelihood of the action occurring depends on a variety of factors, such as ad relevance and creative quality. 
Measurement 
Delivering and demonstrating value for our advertisers is a key objective for Nextdoor. We offer a variety of measurement solutions that are mapped to advertisers’ goals and objectives, and validate Nextdoor’s performance. 
A Kind Platform
Nextdoor is a leading innovator in creating a welcoming platform that facilitates healthy neighborhood connections and conversations. We set clear guidelines and use a combination of people and technology to encourage kind conversations and promote neighborhood vitality. 
From day one, we’ve required neighbors to sign up with their real names and addresses to ensure neighborhoods are made up of real people, nearby, and we have improved on similar verification procedures for businesses We require all new neighbors to accept our Neighbor Pledge upon joining, in order to introduce our community guidelines and provide personal accountability for interactions on the platform. Further, neighbors are alerted when a new neighbor joins so they can reach out with a message of connection and belonging and establish rapport.
As neighbors interact through the platform we use a combination of human review and machine learning and predictive technology solutions, like our Kindness Reminder and Constructive Conversations Reminder, launched in 2022, to enforce our community guidelines, support civility, and cultivate kindness. 
We have always believed it is important to incorporate local context into moderation decisions, which is why we have incorporated volunteer community moderators into our moderation program, alongside Nextdoor operations staff. Volunteer community moderators are active neighbors who have access to specialized tools, resources and training — including an online course designed to help recognize and address bias in online discourse — that they can utilize to promote compliance with our community guidelines. While local community moderators review most types of guideline-violating content, reports of certain types of harmful content (e.g., misinformation, discrimination) are always handled by Nextdoor operations staff to ensure our standards and policies are applied consistently.
Technology
Our investments in technology are focused on the following areas: Core Product Development, Advertising Solutions, and Cloud Infrastructure.
•Core Product Development. We are consistently focused on creating and improving products for neighbors and organizations in the countries in which we operate around the world. We use machine-learning and proprietary technology to power our product strategy of building an Active Valued Community.
•Advertising Solutions. We continue to invest in our proprietary Nextdoor Ads Platform to expand and improve our advertising solutions for businesses of all sizes. In support of our objectives of delivering advertiser value, reducing advertising effort, and enabling businesses to thrive on Nextdoor, our development roadmap is focused on unifying our self-service offerings, leveraging machine learning technologies to improve ad targeting, and enhancing measurement solutions to better inform our value proposition. 
•Cloud Infrastructure. We continually invest in the foundational architecture that supports all of our products and services. We built our infrastructure to be cloud-native, applying well-tested design patterns with distributed systems that are linearly scalable and highly flexible. We partner with third party providers to support the expansion of our platform, which allows us to concentrate on developing our core products.

Human Capital
Our Culture and Core Values
Community is at the heart of Nextdoor and our growing community of employees is our lifeblood. Our employees have a wide range of experiences and perspectives, which fuel our purpose to cultivate a kinder world where everyone has a neighborhood they can rely on.
Our company core values are:
•Earn trust everyday; 
•Invest in community; 
•Customer obsessed; 
•Think big; 
•Experiment and learn quickly; and 
•Act like an owner.
We live these core values through our approach to our people practices, summarized below.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 704 employees in the United States and in our international locations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, France and Australia. 
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging
The principles of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (“DEIB”) are woven into the very fabric of our organization and guide how we recruit, retain, and develop our talent.
Our commitment to DEIB begins at the top and is underscored by the importance of making diverse perspectives a business imperative. This is reflected in the racially diverse and gendered-balanced leaders that make up our Board of Directors, management team, and employees, and who all share in our passion for contributing to and effecting change in communities globally.
We thrive on creating a dynamic, inclusive environment that aims to support and value our employees, and contributes to our award-winning company culture. We have active and engaged Employee Resource Groups that are aligned around dimensions of diversity, such as gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation and other shared attributes, which we believe help foster a sense of community, and a diverse and inclusive workplace.

We also offer training sessions to our employees to emphasize awareness in self, bias and privilege, and inclusion. Further, we focus our global recruitment efforts on ensuring that teams and hiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from historically excluded groups for open roles. Moreover, we distribute a bi-annual employment engagement survey to measure our employees’ satisfaction at Nextdoor, including employees’ perspectives on our current state of workplace inclusivity.
Learning, Development, and Engagement
We have a dedicated Talent Management and Development team that develops and delivers company-wide people programs and learning and development experiences to help our employees grow in their careers. The programs include performance feedback and promotion cycles and recognition through our “Nextdoor Values Awards”. Our learning and development experiences focus on onboarding new hires as well as offering workshops focused on skills development and compliance training.
We are committed to making Nextdoor the best place to work by engaging with, and listening to, our community of employees. We maintain ongoing connection with our team members through weekly all hands meetings, our speaker series, and bi-annual engagement surveys. 
Compensation, Benefits and Perks
We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salaries, sales commissions for certain employees, and equity awards. Additional benefits programs (which vary by country and region) include a 401(k) Plan with a company match, healthcare, vision, and dental insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, flexible paid time off, parental leave, and other benefits tailored to the specific needs of our employees such as family forming, caregiving and mental health resources. We also support and encourage our employees to give back to our communities by giving each employee “Volunteer Time Off” to dedicate to the causes that matter most to them. 
Competition
We compete in almost every aspect of our business with companies that provide a variety of internet products, services, content, and online advertising. In addition, aspects of our platform compete with other products and services, including home services, classifieds, real estate, recommendations and search engines. Of these companies, we most directly compete with social media companies that offer local products to advertisers and users, including large companies such as Meta (including through Facebook and Instagram), Alphabet (including through Google), and other companies that provide home services, classifieds, real estate, recommendations, and search engines. We compete with these companies to attract, engage, and retain users and to attract and retain advertisers. As we introduce new products, as our platform evolves, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition in other countries. 
While our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive, we believe that we compete effectively due to our singular focus on creating and strengthening our neighborhood networks, the size and engagement of our user base, our ability to provide neighbors with trusted information from a uniquely local perspective, our value proposition to advertisers including businesses and public agencies, and our powerful network effects.
Our strengths are real people, hyperlocal proximity, trusted information, local perspective and instant distribution, each of which reinforce each other to create a strong competitive moat.
For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws, regulations, and industry standards that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations that involve data privacy and data protection, intellectual property (including copyright and patent laws), content regulation, rights of publicity, advertising, marketing, health and safety, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, taxation, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering and corruption, telecommunications, and securities. Our business may also be affected by the adoption of any new or existing laws or regulations or changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, or that significantly restrict or impose conditions on our ability to collect, store, augment, analyze, use and share data or increase consumer notice or consent requirements before a company can utilize cookies or other tracking technologies or that increase the liability of content platforms like us. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. 
Table of Contents

We rely on a variety of statutory and common-law frameworks and defenses relevant to the content available on our service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”) and the fair-use doctrine in the United States, and the Electronic Commerce Directive in the European Union. However, each of these statutes is subject to uncertain or evolving judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. For example, in the United States, laws such as the CDA, which have previously been interpreted to provide substantial protection to interactive computer service providers, may change and become less predictable or unfavorable by legislative action or juridical interpretation. There have been various federal and state legislative efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under the CDA, in particular with regards to Section 230 of the CDA, and current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. Moreover in February 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the scope of the CDA protection; rulings in those cases are expected later in 2023 and could narrow the judicial interpretation of the statute, exposing us to additional lawsuits and potential judgments that could seriously harm our business. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. In addition, various countries around the world have adopted and pending legislation, including the recently adopted Digital Services Act (the “DSA”) in the European Union and the Online Safety Act in Australia as well as the draft Online Safety Bill in the United Kingdom, that may impose additional obligations or liability on us associated with content uploaded by users to our platform.
We receive, process, store, use, and share data, some of which contains personal information. We are therefore subject to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy and the collection, storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data from users, employees or business partners, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (“ UK GDPR”), Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, Australia’s The Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) on January 1, 2023, and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. Additionally, three other states have enacted privacy laws that go into effect later in 2023 that have similar requirements and obligations to the California and Virginia laws: the Colorado Data Privacy Act, the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act. There are also a number of legislative proposals recently enacted or pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislatures and foreign governments concerning content regulation and data protection that could affect us, These and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretation of existing laws and regulations, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.
The costs of complying with these laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are high and likely to increase in the future, particularly as the degree of regulation increases, our business grows and our geographic scope expands. Further, the impact of these laws and regulations may disproportionately affect our business in comparison to our peers in the technology sector that have greater resources. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Further, it is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an extended period of time or indefinitely.
We communicate with lawmakers and regulators in the countries and regions in which we do business. We have a dedicated policy team that monitors legal and regulatory developments and works with policymakers and regulators around the world to help ensure that our perspective is heard in matters of importance to us.
For additional information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.”
