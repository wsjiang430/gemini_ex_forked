THIRD FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION OF CLEVELAND
General
The Association is a federally chartered savings and loan association headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that was organized in 1938. In 1997 the Association reorganized into its current two-tier mutual holding company structure. The Association’s principal business consists of originating and servicing residential real estate mortgage loans and attracting retail savings deposits.
The Association’s business strategy is to originate mortgage loans with interest rates that are competitive with those of similar products offered by other financial institutions in its markets. Similarly, the Association offers checking accounts, savings accounts and certificate of deposit accounts, each bearing interest rates that are competitive with similar products offered by other financial institutions in its markets. The Association expects to continue to pursue this business philosophy. While this strategy does not enable the Association to earn the highest rates of interest on loans that it offers or to pay the lowest rates on its deposit accounts, the Association believes that this strategy is the primary reason for its successful growth in the past and will continue to be a successful strategy in the future.
The Association attracts retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding its main office and its branch offices. It also utilizes its internet website, direct mail solicitation and its customer service call center to generate loan applications and attract retail deposits. Since 2013, brokered CDs and more extensive use of longer-term advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati as well as shorter-term advances from the FHLB of Cincinnati, hedged to longer effective durations by 
interest rate exchange contracts, have also been used as cost effective funding alternatives. In addition to residential real estate mortgage loans, the Association originates residential construction loans to individuals for the construction of their personal residences by a qualified builder. The Association also offers home equity loans and lines of credit subject to certain property and credit performance conditions. The Association retains in its portfolio a large portion of the loans that it originates. Loans that the Association sells consist primarily of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans. The Association retains the servicing rights on all loans that it sells. The Association’s revenues are derived primarily from interest on loans and, to a lesser extent, interest on interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions, deposits maintained at the FRS, federal funds sold, and investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities and dividends from FHLB of Cincinnati stock. The Association also generates revenues from fees and service charges. The Association’s primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans and securities and proceeds from loan sales.
The Association’s website address is www.thirdfederal.com. Filings of the Company made with the SEC are available, without charge, on the Association’s website. Information on that website is not and should not be considered a part of this document.
Market Area
The Association conducts its operations from its main office in Cleveland, Ohio, and from 37 additional, full-service branches and eight loan production offices located throughout the states of Ohio and Florida. In Ohio, the Association maintains 21 full-service offices located in the northeast Ohio counties of Cuyahoga, Lake, Lorain, Medina and Summit, four loan production offices located in the central Ohio counties of Franklin and Delaware (Columbus, Ohio) and four loan production offices located in the southern Ohio counties of Butler and Hamilton (Cincinnati, Ohio). In Florida, the Association maintains 16 full-service branches located in the counties of Pasco, Pinellas, Hillsborough, Sarasota, Lee, Collier, Palm Beach and Broward. 
The Association also provides savings products in all 50 states and first mortgage refinance loans in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Home equity lines of credit are provided in 25 states and the District of Columbia. First mortgage loans and bridge loans to purchase homes are provided in 13 states while other equity loan products are provided in eight states. These products are provided through its branch network for customers in its core markets of Ohio, Florida, Kentucky and selected counties in Indiana as well as its customer service call center and its internet site for all customers not served by its branch network.
Competition
The Association faces intense competition in its market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. Its market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions, and it faces additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Some of its competitors offer products and services that the Association currently does not offer, such as commercial business loans, trust services and private banking.
The majority of the Association’s deposits are held in its offices located in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. As of June 30, 2019 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), the Association had $4.7 billion of deposits in Cuyahoga County, and ranked fifth among all financial institutions with offices in the county in terms of deposits, with a market share of 8.25%. As of that date, the Association had $6.1 billion of deposits in the State of Ohio, and ranked ninth among all financial institutions in the state in terms of deposits, with a market share of 1.65%. As of June 30, 2019, the Association had $2.7 billion of deposits in the State of Florida, and ranked 29th among all financial institutions in terms of deposits, with a market share of 0.45%. This market share data excludes deposits held by credit unions, whose deposits are not insured by the FDIC.
 Many financial institutions, including institutions that compete in our markets, have targeted retail deposit gathering as a more attractive funding source than borrowings, and have become more active and more competitive in their deposit product pricing. The combination of reduced demand for borrowed funds, more competition with respect to rates paid to depositors, and low savings rates that lead to reduced appeal for investors that have traditionally allocated a portion of their portfolios to insured savings accounts, has created an increasingly difficult marketplace for attracting deposits, which could adversely affect future operating results.
From October 2018 through September 30, 2019, per data furnished by MarketTrac®, the Association had the largest market share of conventional purchase mortgage loans originated in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. For the same period, it also had the largest market share of conventional purchase mortgage loans originated in the seven northeast Ohio counties which comprise the Cleveland and Akron metropolitan statistical areas. In addition, based on the same statistics, the Association has consistently been one of the ten largest lenders in both Franklin County (Columbus, Ohio) and Hamilton County (Cincinnati, Ohio) since it entered those markets in 1999.

The Association’s primary strategy for increasing and retaining its customer base is to offer competitive deposit and loan rates and other product features, delivered with exceptional customer service, in each of the markets it serves.
We rely on the reputation that has been built during the Association’s over 80-year history of serving its customers and the communities in which it operates, the Association’s high capital levels, and the Association's extensive liquidity alternatives which, in combination, serve to maintain and nurture customer and marketplace confidence. The Company’s high capital ratio continues to reflect the beneficial impact of our 2007 initial public offering, which raised net proceeds of $886 million. At September 30, 2019, our ratio of shareholders’ equity to total assets was 11.7%. Our liquidity alternatives include management and monitoring of the level of liquid assets held in our portfolio as well as the maintenance of alternative wholesale funding sources. For the year ended September 30, 2019, our liquidity ratio averaged 5.59% (which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which ready markets exist, divided by total assets) and, through the Association, we had the ability to immediately borrow an additional $60.7 million from the FHLB of Cincinnati under existing credit arrangements along with $44.9 million from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. From the perspective of collateral value securing FHLB of Cincinnati advances, our capacity limit for additional borrowings beyond the immediately available limit at September 30, 2019 was $4.27 billion, subject to satisfaction of the FHLB of Cincinnati's common stock ownership requirement. To satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would have to increase our ownership of FHLB of Cincinnati common stock by an additional $85.4 million. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
We continue to utilize a multi-faceted approach to support our efforts to instill customer and marketplace confidence. First, we provide thorough and timely information to all of our associates so as to prepare them for their day-to-day interactions with customers and other individuals who are not part of the Company. We believe that it is important that our customers and others sense the comfort level and confidence of our associates throughout their dealings. Second, we encourage our management team to maintain a presence and to be available in our branches and other areas of customer contact, so as to provide more opportunities for informal contact and interaction with our customers and community members. Third, our CEO remains accessible to both local and national media, as a spokesman for our institution as well as an observer and interpreter of financial marketplace situations and events. Fourth, we periodically include advertisements in local newspapers that display our strong capital levels and history of service. We also continue to emphasize our traditional tagline—“STRONG * STABLE * SAFE”—in our advertisements and branch displays. Finally, for customers who adhere to the old adage of trust but verify, we refer them to the safety/security rankings of a nationally recognized, independent rating organization that specializes in the evaluation of financial institutions, which has awarded the Association its highest rating for more than one hundred consecutive quarters.
Lending Activities
The Association’s principal lending activity is the origination of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, first mortgage loans to purchase or refinance residential real estate. Adjustable-rate and 10-year fixed rate first mortgage loans to refinance real estate are offered in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Also, the Association offers adjustable-rate and 10-year fixed rate first mortgage loans to purchase real estate in 13 states. Further, the Association originates residential construction loans to individuals (for the construction of their personal residences by a qualified builder) in Ohio and Florida. The Association also offers home equity lines of credit in 25 states and the District of Columbia and home equity loans in eight states. Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Monitoring and Limiting Our Credit Risk for additional information regarding home equity loans and lines of credit. At September 30, 2019, residential real estate, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, first mortgage loans totaled $10.99 billion, or 83.1% of our loan portfolio, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $2.17 billion, or 16.5% of our loan portfolio, and residential construction loans totaled $52.3 million, or 0.4% of our loan portfolio. At September 30, 2019, adjustable-rate, residential real estate, first mortgage loans totaled $5.06 billion and comprised 38.3% of our loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of the portfolio of loans held for investment, by type of loan segregated by geographic location for the periods indicated, excluding loans held for sale. The majority of our construction loan portfolio is secured by properties located in Ohio and the balances of consumer loans are immaterial. Therefore, neither was segregated by geographic location.

Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loans. The Association’s primary lending activity is the origination of residential real estate mortgage loans. A comparison of 2019 data to the corresponding 2018 data can be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.” The Association currently offers fixed-rate conventional mortgage loans with terms of 30 years or less that are fully amortizing with monthly loan payments, and adjustable-rate mortgage loans that amortize over a period of up to 30 years, provide an initial fixed interest rate for three or five years and then adjust annually, subject to rate reset options as discussed later in this section. At September 30, 2019, there were no “interest only” residential real estate mortgage loans held in the Association's portfolio. 
The Association generally originates both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the FHFA, which is currently $484,350 and $726,525, respectively, for single-family homes in most of our lending markets. The Association also originates loans in amounts that exceed the lending limit for conforming loans, which the Association refers to as “jumbo loans.” The Association generally underwrites jumbo loans in a manner similar to conforming loans. Jumbo loans are not uncommon in the Association’s market areas. 
The Association offers “Smart Rate” adjustable-rate mortgage loan products secured by residential properties with interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of three or five years, after which the interest rate generally resets every year based upon a contractual spread or margin linked to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal. As part of a loan retention program, these adjustable-rate loans provide the borrower with an attractive rate reset option, which allow the borrower to re-lock the rate an unlimited number of times at the Association’s then current lending rates, for another three or five years (which must be the same as the original lock period). Adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally present different credit risks than fixed-rate mortgage loans primarily because the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers increase as interest rates increase, thereby increasing the potential for default. All of the Association’s adjustable-rate mortgage loans are subject to periodic and lifetime limitations on interest rate changes.
All adjustable-rate mortgage loans have initial and periodic caps of two percentage points on interest rate changes, with a cap of five or six percentage points for the life of the loan. Many of the borrowers who select adjustable-rate mortgage loans have shorter-term credit needs than those who select long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans. Prior to 2010, the Association’s adjustable-rate mortgage loan products secured by residential properties offered interest rates that generally reset every year based upon a contractual spread or margin above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of one year, as published weekly by the FRS (“Traditional ARM”). The Association will permit borrowers to convert Traditional ARMs into fixed-rate mortgage loans at no cost to the borrower. The Association has never offered “Option ARM” loans, where borrowers can pay less than the interest owed on their loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. At September 30, 2019, "Smart Rate" adjustable-rate mortgage loans totaled $5.01 billion, or 98.9% of the adjustable-rate mortgage loan portfolio and Traditional ARMs totaled $56.4 million, or 1.1% of the adjustable-rate mortgage loan portfolio. 
The Association has always considered the promotion of home ownership a primary goal. In that regard, it has historically offered affordable housing programs in all of its market areas. These programs are targeted toward low- and moderate-income home buyers. The Association’s philosophy has been to provide borrowers the opportunity for home ownership within their financial means. During the latter portion of fiscal 2016, the Association began to market its HomeReady mortgage loan product for low- and moderate-income homeowners. Third Federal’s HomeReady product is designed to be saleable to Fannie Mae under its HomeReady program. Previously, the Association’s primary affordable housing program was referred to as "Home Today". The vast majority of loans originated under the Home Today program had higher risk characteristics than our Core residential real estate mortgage loan, but the Association attempted to mitigate that higher risk through the use of private mortgage insurance and continued pre- and post-purchase counseling. As of September 30, 2019, the Association had $84.9 million of loans outstanding that were originated through its Home Today program, most of which were originated prior to March 2009. At September 30, 2019, of the loans that were originated under the Home Today program, 8.2% were delinquent 30 days or more compared to 0.2% for the portfolio of Core loans as of that date. At September 30, 2019, $2.6 million, or 3.1%, of loans originated under the Home Today program were delinquent 90 days and over and $12.4 million of Home Today loans were non-accruing loans, representing 17.5% of total non-accruing loans as of that date. See “Non-performing Assets and Restructured Loans—Delinquent Loans” for a discussion of the asset quality of this portion of the Association’s loan portfolio.
For loans with LTV ratios in excess of 85% but equal to or less than 95%, the Association requires private mortgage insurance. LTV ratios in excess of 80% are not available for refinance transactions except for adjustable-rate, first mortgage loans and HomeReady loans. The HomeReady product requires private mortgage insurance on purchase transactions between 80.01% and 97% LTV and refinance transactions between 80.01% and 95% LTV. 
The Association currently retains the servicing rights on all loans sold in order to generate fee income and reinforce its commitment to customer service. One- to four-family residential mortgage real estate loans that have been sold were underwritten generally to Fannie Mae guidelines. At the time of the closing of these loans the Association owns the loans and subsequently sells them to Fannie Mae and others providing normal and customary representations and warranties, including representations and warranties related to compliance, generally with Fannie Mae underwriting standards. At the time of sale, the loans are free from encumbrances except for the mortgages filed by the Association which, with other underwriting documents, are subsequently assigned and delivered to Fannie Mae and others. During each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Association recognized servicing fees, net of amortization, related to these servicing rights of $4.2 million and $4.3 million. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the principal balance of loans serviced for others totaled $1.80 billion and $1.93 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2019, substantially all of the loans serviced for Fannie Mae and others were performing in accordance with their contractual terms and management believes that it has no material repurchase obligations associated with these loans. However, at September 30, 2019 an accrual for $0.6 million has been maintained for potential repurchase or loss reimbursement requests. 
The Association actively monitors its interest rate risk position to determine its desired level of investment in fixed-rate mortgages. While the sales of first mortgage loans remain strategically important for us, since fiscal 2010, they have played a lesser role in our management of interest rate risk.
The Association requires title insurance on all of its residential real estate mortgage loans. The Association also requires that borrowers maintain fire and extended coverage casualty insurance (and, if appropriate, flood insurance up to $250 thousand) in an amount at least equal to the lesser of the loan balance or the replacement cost of the improvements. A majority of its residential real estate mortgage loans have a mortgage escrow account from which disbursements are made for real estate taxes and to a lesser extent for hazard insurance and flood insurance. The Association does not conduct environmental testing on residential real estate mortgage loans unless specific concerns for hazards are identified by the appraiser used in connection with the origination of the loan.
Prior to November 2008, the Association also originated loans under its high LTV program. These loans had initial LTV ratios as high as 95%. High LTV loans were originated with higher interest rates than the Association’s other residential real 
estate loans. To qualify for this program, the loan applicant was required to satisfy more stringent underwriting criteria (credit score, income qualification, and other criteria). Borrowers did not obtain private mortgage insurance with respect to these loans, but the Association had negotiated with a private mortgage insurance carrier for pooled private mortgage insurance coverage. As of September 30, 2019, the Association had $37.2 million of loans outstanding that were originated through its High LTV program, $31.9 million of which the Association has insured through the private mortgage insurance carrier. 
Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit. The Association offers home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, which are primarily secured by a second mortgage on residences. The home equity product is now offered in 25 states and the District of Columbia. Home equity lines of credit originated since 2013 require amortizing loan payments during the draw period. These offers were, and are, subject to certain property and credit performance conditions which, among other items, related to CLTV, geography, borrower income verification, minimum credit scores and draw period duration. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, home equity loans totaled $421.8 million, or 3.2%, and $440.8 million, or 3.4%, respectively, of total loans receivable (which included $269.4 million and $305.1 million, respectively, of home equity lines of credit which were in the amortization period and no longer eligible to be drawn upon and $26.5 million and $27.8 million of bridge loans), and home equity lines of credit totaled $1.75 billion, or 13.3%, and $1.38 billion, or 10.7%, respectively, of total loans receivable. A bridge loan permits a borrower to utilize the existing equity in their current home to fund the purchase of a new home before the current home is sold. Bridge loans are originated for a one-year term, with no prepayment penalties. These loans have fixed interest rates, and are currently limited to a combined 80% LTV ratio (first and second mortgage liens). The Association charges a closing fee with respect to bridge loans. Additionally, at September 30, 2019 and 2018, the unadvanced amounts of home equity lines of credit totaled $2.21 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively. Home equity products offered by the Association prior to 2015 varied significantly as the product was slowly reintroduced at much lower volumes following the 2008 housing crisis. Prior to June 2010, the Association offered home equity loans and home equity lines of credit with underwriting standards that were less restrictive than current underwriting standards, which impacted acceptable LTV ratios, minimum credit scores, income and employment verification and line amounts. The vast majority of those pre-2010 products have been paid off, refinanced under current underwriting standards or are in the amortization period and no longer eligible to be drawn upon.
The Association originated its home equity loans and home equity lines of credit without application fees (except for bridge loans) or borrower-paid closing costs. Home equity loans were offered with fixed interest rates, were fully amortizing and had terms of up to 15 years. The Association’s home equity lines of credit were offered with adjustable rates of interest indexed to the Prime Rate, as reported in The Wall Street Journal. 
The following table sets forth credit exposure, principal balance, percent delinquent 90 days or more, the mean CLTV percent at the time of origination and the current CLTV percent of our home equity loans, home equity lines of credit and bridge loan portfolio as of September 30, 2019.

In general, the home equity line of credit product originated prior to June 2010 was characterized by a ten year draw period followed by a ten year repayment period; however, there were two types of transactions that could result in a draw period that extended beyond ten years. The first transaction involved customer requests for increases in the amount of their home equity line of credit. When the customer’s credit performance and profile supported the increase, the draw period term was reset for the ten year period following the date of the increase in the home equity line of credit amount. A second transaction that impacted the draw period involved extensions. If the account and customer met certain pre-established criteria, an offer was made to extend the otherwise expiring draw period by ten years from the date of the offer. If the customer chose to accept the extension, the origination date of the account remained unchanged but the account would have a revised draw period that was extended by ten years. As a result of these two programs, the reported draw periods for certain home equity line of credit accounts exceed ten years.

Home equity lines of credit originated in 2009 or earlier had delinquency levels comparatively higher than the years following 2010. Home equity lines of credit originated during those years also saw higher loan amounts, higher permitted LTV ratios, and lower credit scores. Declining housing values after 2008 contributed to the higher delinquencies for those years. However, recent increases in home values have allowed customers to refinance their home equity lines of credit approaching the end of the draw period. Most of the remaining home equity lines of credit originated in 2009 or prior have come to the end of their draw period and are in repayment. The combination of the principal balance of all home equity products no longer in the draw period, plus those lines originated in 2009 and earlier, is $427.0 million, a reduction of $126.2 million during the current fiscal year. In addition, as shown in the table below, the principal balance of home equity lines of credit in the draw period that have a current mean CLTV over 80% or unknown is $9.4 million, or 0.5% at September 30, 2019. 
While there have been recent improvements, the previous past weakness in the housing market causes us to continue to conduct an expanded loan level evaluation of our home equity lines of credit which are delinquent 90 days or more.
The following table sets forth the breakdown of current mean CLTV percentages for our home equity lines of credit in the draw period as of September 30, 2019.

Construction Loans. The Association originates construction loans to individuals for the construction of their personal single-family residence by a qualified builder (construction/permanent loans). The Association’s construction/permanent loans generally provide for disbursements to the builder or sub-contractors during the construction phase as work progresses. During the construction phase, the borrower only pays interest on the drawn balance. Upon completion of construction, the loan converts to a permanent amortizing loan without the expense of a second closing. The Association offers construction/permanent loans with fixed or adjustable rates, and a current maximum loan-to-completed-appraised value ratio of 85%. At September 30, 2019, construction loans totaled $52.3 million, or 0.4% of total loans receivable. At September 30, 2019, the unadvanced portion of these construction loans totaled $25.7 million.
Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, the Association may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. This is more likely to occur when home prices are falling.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations and Servicing. Lending activities are conducted by the Association’s loan personnel (all of whom are non-commissioned associates) operating at our main and branch office locations and at our loan production offices. All loans that the Association originates are underwritten pursuant to its policies and procedures, which, for real estate loans, are consistent with the ability to repay guidance provided by the CFPB. A small number of loans originated with the intent to sell and certain other long-term, fixed-rate loans, as described below, are originated using Fannie Mae processing and underwriting guidelines. The majority of loans, however, are originated using guidelines that are similar, but not identical to Fannie Mae processing and underwriting guidelines. The Association originates both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans and advertises extensively throughout its market area. Its ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent upon the relative consumer demand for such loans, which is affected by current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. The Association’s loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by a rising interest rate environment or economic recession, which typically results in decreased loan demand. The Association’s residential real estate mortgage loan originations are generated by its in-house loan representatives, by direct mail solicitations, by referrals from existing or past customers, by referrals from local builders and real estate brokers, from calls to its telephone call center and from the internet. 
Except for loans originated in accordance with the guidelines of Fannie Mae's HomeReady program, which loans are originated with the intent to sell, the Association decides whether to retain, sell or securitize the loans that it originates, after evaluating current and projected market interest rates, its interest rate risk objectives, its liquidity needs and other factors. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Association sold to Fannie Mae, in either whole loan or security form, $98.4 million of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans, and to a private investor, $18.9 million of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans, all on a servicing retained basis. In addition to sales of long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate mortgage loans, the Association has also previously sold to private parties, non-agency eligible, adjustable-rate loans on a servicing retained basis. Those sales evidenced the saleability of our loans that are not originated in accordance with agency specified procedures, including adjustable-rate loans. As described in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Controlling Our Interest Rate Risk Exposure, the Association implemented loan origination changes in fiscal 2014 with respect to a small portion of our loan originations, which allow that portion of our first mortgage loan originations that were processed using the revised procedures to be eligible for securitization and sale in Fannie Mae mortgage backed security form. The balance of loans held for sale was $3.7 million at September 30, 2019, which were originated pursuant to the guidelines of Fannie Mae's HomeReady program. 
Historically, the Association has retained the servicing rights on all residential real estate mortgage loans that it has sold, and intends to continue this practice into the future. At September 30, 2019, the Association serviced loans owned by others with a principal balance of $1.80 billion. Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Association retains a portion of the interest paid by the borrower on the loans it services as consideration for its servicing activities. The Association did not enter into any loan participations during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and does not expect to do so in the near future.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Association’s lending activities follow written underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by its Board of Directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, the Association reviews the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.
The Association’s policies and loan approval limits are established by its Board of Directors. The Association’s Board of Directors has delegated authority to its Executive Committee (consisting of the Association’s Chief Executive Officer and two directors) to review and assign lending authorities to certain individuals of the Association to consider and approve loans within their designated authority. Residential real estate mortgage loans and construction loans require the approval of one individual with designated underwriting authority.
The Association requires independent third-party valuations of real property. Appraisals are performed by independent licensed appraisers.
Delinquent Loans. The following tables set forth the number and recorded investment in loan delinquencies by type, segregated by geographic location and severity of delinquency at the dates indicated. The majority of our construction loan portfolio is secured by properties located in Ohio; therefore, it is not segregated by geography. There were no delinquencies in the construction loan portfolio for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Total loans seriously delinquent (i.e. delinquent 90 days or over) decreased four basis points to 0.12% of total net loans at September 30, 2019, from 0.16% at September 30, 2018. The percentage of seriously delinquent loans to total net loans decreased in the residential Core portfolio from 0.08% to 0.06%. Such loans in the residential Home Today portfolio decreased from 0.03% to 0.02%; and in the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio decreased from 0.05% to 0.04%. Although regional employment levels have improved, we expect some borrowers who are current on their loans at September 30, 2019 to experience payment problems in the future. 
Non-performing Assets and Restructured Loans: Collection Procedures. Within 15 days of a borrower’s delinquency, the Association attempts personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure that the borrower correctly understands the terms of the loan and to emphasize the importance of making payments on or before the due date. If necessary, subsequent late charges and delinquent notices are issued and the borrower’s account will be monitored on a regular basis thereafter. The Association also mails system-generated reminder notices on a monthly basis. When a loan is more than 30 days past due, the Association attempts to contact the borrower and develop a plan of repayment. By the 90th day of delinquency, the Association may recommend foreclosure. The loan will be evaluated for impairment prior to the 180th day of delinquency. For further discussion on evaluating loans for impairment, see Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is provided to the Association’s Board of Directors.
Loans are placed in non-accrual status when they are contractually 90 days or more past due or if collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. Loans restructured in TDRs that were in non-accrual status prior to the restructurings remain in non-accrual status for a minimum of six months. Home equity loans and lines of credit which are subordinate to a first mortgage lien where the customer is seriously delinquent, are placed in non-accrual status. Loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status where all borrowers have been discharged from their mortgage obligation or where all borrowers had filed, and had not reaffirmed or been dismissed, are placed in non-accrual status. For discussion on interest recognition, see Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The table below sets forth the recorded investments and categories of our non-performing assets and TDRs at the dates indicated.

______________________

(1) | The totals at September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 include $0.6 million, $0.5 million, $0.5 million, $1.3 million and $1.8 million of performing home equity lines of credit, pursuant to regulatory guidance regarding senior lien delinquency issued in January 2012.


(2) | At September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the totals include $52.1 million, $52.1 million, $47.0 million, $51.4 million and $55.5 million, respectively, in TDRs: which are less than 90 days past due but included with non-accrual loans for a minimum period of six months from the restructuring date due to their non-accrual status prior to restructuring; because they have been partially charged off; or because all borrowers have filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and had not reaffirmed or been dismissed.


(3) | At September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 the totals include $8.4 million, $10.5 million, $11.9 million, $12.4 million and $15.0 million in TDRs that are 90 days or more past due, respectively.

The gross interest income that would have been recorded during the year ended September 30, 2019 on non-accrual loans if they had been accruing during the entire period and TDRs if they had been current and performing in accordance with their original terms during the entire period was $8.9 million. The interest income recognized on those loans included in net income for the year ended September 30, 2019 was $5.4 million.
Impaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Association will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For discussion on impairment measurement, see Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The recorded investment of impaired loans includes accruing TDRs and loans that are returned to accrual status when contractual payments are less than 90 days past due. Also, the recorded investment of non-accrual loans includes loans that are not included in the recorded investment of impaired loans because they are included in loans collectively evaluated for impairment. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of the recorded investments and categories between non-accrual loans and impaired loans at the dates indicated.

In response to the economic challenges facing many borrowers, we continue to restructure loans. Loan restructuring is a method used to help families keep their homes and preserve our neighborhoods. This involves making changes to the borrowers’ loan terms through interest rate reductions, either for a specific period or for the remaining term of the loan; term extensions including those beyond that provided in the original agreement; principal forgiveness; capitalization of delinquent payments in special situations; or some combination of the above. Loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy are also reported as TDRs per OCC interpretive guidance. For discussion on impairment measurement, see Note 5. LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We had $157.4 million of TDRs (accrual and non-accrual) recorded at September 30, 2019, of which $80.3 million are Residential Core, $36.3 million are Home Today and $40.8 million are Home equity loans and lines of credit. This is an $8.0 million decrease in the recorded investment of TDRs from September 30, 2018. 
The following table sets forth the recorded investments of accrual and non-accrual TDRs, by the types of concessions granted as of September 30, 2019.

TDRs in accrual status are loans accruing interest and performing according to the terms of the restructuring. To be performing, a loan must be less than 90 days past due as of the report date. Non-accrual, performing status indicates that a loan was not accruing interest at the time of restructuring, continues to not accrue interest and is performing according to the terms of the restructuring, but has not been current for at least six consecutive months since its restructuring, has a partial charge-off, or is being classified as non-accrual per the OCC guidance on loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy status, where all borrowers have filed 
and have not reaffirmed or been dismissed. Non-accrual, non-performing status includes loans that are not accruing interest because they are greater than 90 days past due and therefore not performing according to the terms of the restructuring.
Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until sold. When property is acquired, it is recorded at the estimated fair market value at the date of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions. Subsequent to acquisition, real estate owned is carried at the lower of the cost basis or estimated fair market value less estimated costs to sell. Increases in the fair market value are recognized through income not exceeding the valuation allowance. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair market value result in charges to expense after acquisition. At September 30, 2019, we had $2.2 million in real estate owned.
Classification of Assets. Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current payment capacity of the borrower or the collateral pledged has a defined weakness that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable or improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve management's attention and may result in further deterioration in their repayment prospects and/or the Association's credit position, are required to be designated as special mention.
When we classify assets as either substandard or doubtful, we allocate a portion of the related general loss allowances to such assets as we deem prudent. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date. When we classify a problem asset as loss, we charge-off that portion of the asset that is uncollectible. Our determinations as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our loss allowances are subject to review by the Association's primary federal regulator, the OCC, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of our review of assets at September 30, 2019, the recorded investment of classified assets consists of substandard assets of $85.0 million, including $2.2 million of real estate owned, and we also had $6.9 million of assets designated special mention. As of September 30, 2019, there were no individual assets with balances exceeding $1 million that were classified as substandard. Substandard assets at September 30, 2019 include $16.1 million of loans 90 or more days past due and $66.7 million of loans less than 90 days past due displaying a weakness sufficient to warrant an adverse classification, the majority of which are TDRs.
Allowance for Loan Losses. We provide for loan losses based on the allowance method. Accordingly, all loan losses are charged to, and all recoveries are credited to, the related allowance. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges to income based on various factors which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses. We regularly review the loan portfolio and make provisions (or recapture credits) for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two components:

(1) | individual valuation allowances (IVAs) established for any impaired loans dependent on cash flows, such as performing TDRs, and IVAs related to a portion of the allowance on loans individually reviewed that represents further deterioration in the fair value of the collateral not yet identified as uncollectible; and


(2) | general valuation allowances (GVAs), which are comprised of quantitative GVAs, which are general allowances for loan losses for each loan type based on historical loan loss experience and qualitative GVAs, which are adjustments to the quantitative GVAs, maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of incurred probable losses for each loan type.

The qualitative GVAs expand our ability to identify and estimate probable losses and are based on our evaluation of the following factors, some of which are consistent with factors that impact the determination of quantitative GVAs. For example, delinquency statistics (both current and historical) are used in developing the quantitative GVAs while the trending of the delinquency statistics is considered and evaluated in the determination of the qualitative GVAs. Factors impacting the determination of qualitative GVAs include:

• | changes in lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards, collection, charge-off or recovery practices;


• | changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and trends including treasury yields, housing market factors and trends, such as the status of loans in foreclosure, real estate in judgment and real estate owned, and unemployment statistics and trends;


• | changes in the nature and volume of the portfolios including home equity lines of credit nearing the end of the draw period and adjustable-rate mortgage loans nearing a rate reset;


• | changes in the experience, ability or depth of lending management;


• | changes in the volume or severity of past due loans, volume of nonaccrual loans, or the volume and severity of adversely classified loans including the trending of delinquency statistics (both current and historical), historical loan loss experience and trends, the frequency and magnitude of multiple restructurings of loans previously the subject of TDRs, and uncertainty surrounding borrowers’ ability to recover from temporary hardships for which short-term loan restructurings are granted;


• | changes in the quality of the loan review system;


• | changes in the value of the underlying collateral including asset disposition loss statistics (both current and historical) and the trending of those statistics, and additional charge-offs on individually reviewed loans;


• | existence of any concentrations of credit; and


• | effect of other external factors such as competition, market interest rate changes or legal and regulatory requirements including market conditions and regulatory directives that impact the entire financial services industry.

When loan restructurings qualify as TDRs and the loans are performing according to the terms of the restructuring, we record an IVA based on the present value of expected future cash flows, which includes a factor for potential subsequent defaults, discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan contract. Potential defaults are distinguished from multiple restructurings as borrowers who default are generally not eligible for subsequent restructurings. At September 30, 2019, the balance of such individual valuation allowances was $13.5 million. In instances when loans require multiple restructurings, additional valuation allowances may be required. The new valuation allowance on a loan that has multiple restructurings is calculated based on the present value of the expected cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan contract, considering the new terms of the restructured agreement. Due to the immaterial amount of this exposure to date, we continue to capture this exposure as a component of our qualitative GVA evaluation. The significance of this exposure will be monitored and, if warranted, we will enhance our loan loss methodology to include a new default factor (developed to reflect the estimated impact to the balance of the allowance for loan losses that will occur as a result of subsequent future restructurings) that will be assessed against all loans reviewed collectively. If new default factors are implemented, the qualitative GVA methodology will be adjusted to preclude duplicative loss consideration.
Home equity loans and lines of credit generally have higher credit risk than traditional residential mortgage loans. These loans and lines are usually in a second lien position and when combined with the first mortgage, result in generally higher overall loan-to-value ratios. In a stressed housing market with high delinquencies and decreasing housing prices, these higher loan-to-value ratios represent a greater risk of loss to the Company. A borrower with more equity in the property has a vested interest in keeping the loan current when compared to a borrower with little or no equity in the property. In light of the past weakness in the housing market and uncertainty with respect to future employment levels and economic prospects, we conduct an expanded loan level evaluation of our home equity loans and lines of credit, including bridge loans, which are delinquent 90 days or more. This expanded evaluation is in addition to our traditional evaluation procedures. Considering the review process and our suspension program, no allowance is deemed necessary for our unfunded commitments on this portfolio. Our home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio continues to comprise a significant portion of our gross charge-offs. At September 30, 2019, we had a recorded investment of $2.20 billion in home equity loans and equity lines of credit outstanding, $5.8 million, or 0.3% of which were delinquent 90 days or more.
We evaluate the allowance for loan losses based upon the combined total of the quantitative and qualitative GVAs and IVAs. We periodically evaluate the carrying value of loans and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. While we use the best information available to make evaluations, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions.
 For more information regarding the allowance for loan losses, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
The following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses segregated by geographic location for the periods indicated. The majority of our construction loan portfolio is secured by properties located in Ohio and the balances of other consumer loans are immaterial; therefore neither was segregated.

Charge-offs decreased during the year ended September 30, 2019 when compared to the year ended September 30, 2018, reflecting the improving market conditions. We continue to evaluate loans becoming delinquent for potential losses and record provisions for the estimate of those losses. We expect a moderate level of charge-offs to continue as delinquent loans are resolved in the future and uncollected balances are charged against the allowance.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. The following tables set forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the percent of allowance in each category to the total allowance, and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

During the year ended September 30, 2019, the total allowance for loan losses decreased $3.5 million, to $38.9 million from $42.4 million at September 30, 2018, as we recorded a $10.0 million credit for loan losses, while recoveries exceeded loan charge-offs by $6.5 million for the year. The allowance for loan losses related to loans evaluated collectively decreased by $4.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2019, and the allowance for loan losses related to loans evaluated individually increased by $1.4 million. Refer to the "Activity in the Allowance for Loan Losses" and "Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses" tables in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Other than the less significant construction and other consumer loans segments, changes during the year ended September 30, 2019 in the balances of the GVAs, excluding changes in IVAs, related to the significant loan segments are described as follows:

• | Residential Core – The recorded investment of this segment of the loan portfolio decreased 0.3% or $28.3 million, while the total allowance for loan losses increased 8.0% or $1.5 million. The portion of this loan segment’s allowance for loan losses that was determined by evaluating groups of loans collectively (i.e. those loans that were not individually evaluated), increased $1.3 million, or 11.6%, from $11.4 million at September 30, 2018 to $12.7 million at September 30, 2019. The ratio of this portion of the allowance for loan losses to the total balance of loans in this loan segment that were evaluated collectively, increased 0.02% to 0.12% at September 30, 2019 from 0.10% at September 30, 2018. The increases in the balance and ratio of the allowance for loan losses reflected the Association's concern around the recent 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inversion. History has shown that yield curve inversion is often a leading indicator of a recession, which has been historically followed by increased delinquencies and losses. Helping to temper the increase in the allowance were the relatively low levels of loan delinquencies during the current year when compared to prior periods. Total delinquencies decreased 10.4% to $18.5 million at September 30, 2019 from $20.7 million at September 30, 2018. Loans 90 or more days delinquent decreased 29.0% to $7.7 million at September 30, 2019 from $10.8 million at September 30, 2018. Net recoveries during the current year were less at

$1.1 million as compared to $1.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2018. The credit profile of this portfolio segment remained strong during the fiscal year due to the addition of high credit quality, residential first mortgage loans. 

• | Residential Home Today – The recorded investment of this segment of the loan portfolio decreased 10.7% or $10.1 million, as we are no longer originating loans under the Home Today program. The total allowance for loan losses for this segment increased by $1.0 million or 31.4%, which was determined by evaluating groups of loans collectively (i.e. those loans that were not individually evaluated), increased by 67.8% from $1.1 million at September 30, 2018 to $1.8 million at September 30, 2019. Similarly, the ratio of the allowance to the total balance of loans in this loan segment that were evaluated collectively, increased 1.8% to 3.8% at September 30, 2019 from 2.0% at September 30, 2018. Total delinquencies decreased from $8.4 million at September 30, 2018 to $6.9 million at September 30, 2019. Delinquencies greater than 90 days decreased from $3.8 million to $2.6 million during the same period. Net recoveries during the current quarter were greater at $1.1 million compared to $0.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2018. This allowance fluctuates based on not only the generally declining portfolio balance, but also on the credit profile trends in this portfolio. This allowance increased this year based on the risk that remains based on the generally less stringent credit requirements that were in place at the time that these borrowers qualified for their loans, the Association's concern around the recent 2-year/10-year Treasury yield curve inversion historically followed by increased delinquencies and losses and the continued depressed home values that remain in this portfolio.


• | Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit – The recorded investment of this segment of the loan portfolio increased 19.6% or $360.2 million from $1.84 billion at September 30, 2018 to $2.20 billion at September 30, 2019. The total allowance for loan losses for this segment decreased 28.6% to $14.9 million from $20.9 million at September 30, 2018. The portion of this loan segment's allowance for loan losses that was determined by evaluating groups of loans collectively (i.e. those loans that were not individually evaluated) decreased by $7.0 million, or 38.9%, from $17.9 million to $10.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2019. The ratio of this portion of the allowance to the total balance of loans in this loan segment that were evaluated collectively also decreased to 0.5% at September 30, 2019 from 1.0% at September 30, 2018. Net recoveries for this loan segment during the current year were greater at $4.3 million for the current year as compared to $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. Total delinquencies for this portfolio segment decreased 19.5% to $10.0 million at September 30, 2019 as compared to $12.4 million at September 30, 2018. Delinquencies greater than 90 days decreased 2.3% to $5.8 million at September 30, 2019 from $5.9 million at September 30, 2018. The reduction in the allowance is mainly supported by a reduction of the principal balance of home equity lines of credit coming to the end of the draw period. In recent years, a large portion of the overall allowance has been allocated to the home equity loans and lines of credit portfolio to address exposure from customers whose lines of credit were originated without amortizing payments during the draw period and who could face potential increased payment shock at the end of the draw period. In general, home equity lines of credit originated prior to June 2010 were characterized by a ten-year draw period, with interest only payments, followed by a ten-year repayment period. However, a large number of those lines of credit approaching the end of draw period have been paid off or refinanced without significant loss. The principal balance of home equity lines of credit originated without amortizing payments during the draw period that are coming to the end of its draw period through fiscal 2020 is $8.1 million at September 30, 2019, compared to $116.9 million at September 30, 2018. As this exposure decreases without incurring significant loss, the portion of the overall allowance allocated to the home equity loans and lines of credit category can be decreased. Originations after February 2013 require an amortizing payment during the draw period and do not face the same end-of-draw increased payment shock risk.

While the portfolio performance has improved, loan losses on home equity loans and lines of credit continued to comprise a large component of our gross charge-offs for 2019 and are expected to continue to represent a large portion of our charge-offs for the foreseeable future based on the relatively higher risk of this product when compared to a first mortgage loan. 
Our analysis for evaluating the adequacy of and the appropriateness of our loan loss provision and allowance for loan losses is continually refined as new information becomes available and actual loss experience is acquired. During the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 no material changes were made to the allowance methodology. 
Investments
The Association’s Board of Directors is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Association’s investment policy. The investment policy is reviewed at least annually by management and any changes to the policy are recommended to the Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and are subject to its approval. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, the ability to provide collateral for pledging requirements, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. The Association’s Investment Committee, which consists of its chief operating officer, chief financial officer and other members of management, oversees its investing activities and strategies. The portfolio manager is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance 
with established policies. The portfolio manager has the authority to purchase and sell securities within specific guidelines established in the investment policy, but historically the portfolio manager has executed purchases only after extensive discussions with other Investment Committee members. All transactions are formally reviewed by the Investment Committee at least quarterly. Any investment which, subsequent to its purchase, fails to meet the guidelines of the policy is reported to the Investment Committee, who decides whether to hold or sell the investment.
The Association’s investment policy requires that it invest primarily in debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, agencies of the U.S. Government, and government-sponsored entities, which include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae as well as collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits issued or backed by securities issued by these governmental agencies and government-sponsored entities. The investment policy also permits investments in asset-backed securities, banker’s acceptances, money market funds, term federal funds, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements.
The Association’s investment policy does not permit investment in municipal bonds, corporate debt obligations, preferred or common stock of government agencies or equity securities other than its required investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati. As of September 30, 2019, we held no asset-backed securities or securities with sub-prime credit risk exposure, nor did we hold any banker’s acceptances, term federal funds, repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. As a federal savings association, the Association is not permitted to invest in equity securities. This general restriction does not apply to the Company. The Association’s investment policy permits the use of interest rate agreements (caps, floors and collars) and interest rate exchange contracts (swaps) in managing our interest rate risk exposure. The use of financial futures, however, is prohibited without specific approval from its Board of Directors.
FASB ASC 320, “Investments-Debt and Equity Securities,” requires that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities designated as available-for-sale are reported at fair value, while securities designated as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost. As a result of previous guidance from the Company's primary regulator that indicated that the Company's reported balance of liquid assets could not include any investment security not classified as available for sale, all investment securities held by the Company are classified as available for sale. We do not have a trading portfolio.
The fair value of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2019 consisted of $6.8 million in primarily fixed-rate securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, and $541.0 million of REMICs collateralized only by securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. 
U.S. Government and Federal Agency Obligations. While U.S. Government and federal agency securities generally provide lower yields than other investment options authorized in the Association's and Company's investment policies, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate, for liquidity purposes, as collateral for borrowings and as an interest rate risk hedge in the event of significant mortgage loan prepayments.
Mortgage-Backed Securities. We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae. The U.S. Treasury Department has established financing agreements to ensure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed.
Mortgage-backed securities are created by the pooling of mortgages and the issuance of a security with an interest rate that is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, although we invest primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one- to four-family mortgages. The issuers of such securities (generally Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Association, and guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements. However, mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is an active trading market for such securities. While there has been significant disruption in the demand for private issuer mortgage-backed securities, the U.S. Treasury support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantees has maintained an orderly market for the mortgage-backed securities the Company typically purchases. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Investments in mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that the timing of actual payments will be earlier or later than the timing estimated when the mortgage-backed security was purchased, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically 
review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modifications that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments.
REMICs are types of debt securities issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and creates different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into “tranches” or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows, while cash flows on pass-through mortgage-backed securities are distributed pro rata to all security holders.
The following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of our securities portfolio (excluding FHLB of Cincinnati common stock) at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits traditionally have been the primary source of funds for the Association’s lending and investment activities. The Association also borrows, primarily from the FHLB of Cincinnati and the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window, to supplement cash flow, to lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk management purposes and to manage its cost of funds. Additional sources of funds are scheduled loan payments, maturing investments, loan prepayments, collateralized wholesale borrowings, income on other earning assets, the proceeds from loan sales, and brokered CDs.
Deposits. The Association obtains deposits primarily from the areas in which its branch offices are located, as well as from its customer service call center, its internet website, and from brokered CDs. It relies on its competitive pricing, convenient locations, and customer service to attract and retain its non-brokered deposits. It offers a variety of retail deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Its retail deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, money market accounts, checking accounts, CDs, individual retirement accounts, and other qualified plan accounts. 
Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market interest rates, liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by competitors, and our deposit growth goals.
At September 30, 2019, deposits totaled $8.77 billion. Checking accounts totaled $862.6 million (including $787.8 million of interest-bearing checking accounts) and savings accounts totaled $1.48 billion (including $1.39 billion of higher yield savings accounts and MMK). At September 30, 2019, the Association had a total of $6.42 billion in CDs (including $507.8 million of brokered CDs), of which $3.31 billion had remaining maturities of one year or less. Based on historical experience and its current pricing strategy, management believes the Association will retain a large portion of these accounts upon maturity.

Borrowings. At September 30, 2019, the Association had $3.90 billion of borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Association’s only third-party borrowings consisted of loans, commonly referred to as “advances,” from the FHLB of Cincinnati. Borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati are secured by the Association’s investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Cincinnati as well as by a blanket pledge of its mortgage portfolio not otherwise pledged. Our current, immediate additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Cincinnati is $60.7 million as limited by the amount of FHLB of Cincinnati common stock that we own. Based on the amount of collateral that is subject to the blanket pledge that secures advances, in addition to the existing available capacity, our capacity limit for additional borrowings from the FHLB of Cincinnati at September 30, 2019 was $4.27 billion, subject to satisfaction of the FHLB of Cincinnati common stock ownership requirement. To satisfy the common stock ownership requirement, we would have to increase our ownership of FHLB of Cincinnati common stock by an additional $85.4 million. The ability to borrow from the FRB-Cleveland Discount Window is also available to the Association and is secured by a pledge of specific loans in the Association’s mortgage portfolio. At September 30, 2019, the Association had the capacity to borrow up to $44.9 million from the FRB-Cleveland and had no amount outstanding as of that date.

Federal Taxation
General. The Company and the Association are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with certain exceptions. Prior to the completion of our initial public stock offering on April 20, 2007, the Company and the Association were included as part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group. However, upon completion of the offering, the Company and the Association were no longer a part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group because Third Federal Savings, MHC no longer owned at least 80% of the common stock of the Company. As a result of the Company's stock repurchase program over the past few years, which reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company, at September 30, 2019, Third Federal Savings, MHC, owned 81.12% of the common stock of the Company and the Company and the Association can, again, be a part of Third Federal Savings, MHC’s consolidated tax group. Beginning on September 30, 2007 and for each subsequent fiscal year thereafter, the Company has filed consolidated tax returns with the Association and Third Capital Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries.
Bad Debt Reserves. Historically, the Third Federal Savings, MHC consolidated group used the specific charge-off method to account for bad debt deductions for income tax purposes, and the Company has used and intends to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions in the future.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Association failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if the Association makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a bank for tax purposes.
At September 30, 2019, the total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve of the Association was approximately $105.0 million.
State Taxation
Following its initial public stock offering in 2007, the Company converted from a qualified passive investment company domiciled in the State of Delaware to a qualified holding company in Ohio. The Third Federal Savings, MHC consolidated group is subject to the Ohio Financial Institutions Tax. The Financial Institutions Tax is based on total equity capital apportioned to Ohio using a single gross receipts factor. Ohio equity capital is taxed at a three-tiered rate of 0.8% on the first $200 million, 0.4% on amounts greater than $200 million and less than or equal to $1.3 billion, and 0.25% on amounts greater than $1.3 billion. 
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
General
The Company is a savings and loan holding company, and is required to file certain reports with, is subject to examination by, and otherwise must comply with the rules and regulations of, the FRS. The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
The Association is a federal savings association that is currently examined and supervised by the OCC and the CFPB, and is subject to examination by the FDIC under certain circumstances. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk. Following completion of its examination, the federal agency critiques the institution’s operations and assigns its rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). Under federal law, an institution may not disclose its CAMELS rating to the public. The Association also is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Cincinnati, which is one of the eleven regional banks in the FHLB System. The Association is also regulated to a lesser extent by the FRS, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. The OCC will examine the Association and prepare reports for the consideration of the Association’s Board of Directors on any operating deficiencies. The CFPB, which is discussed further in the Dodd-Frank Act section that follows, has examination and enforcement authority over the Association. The Association’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of the Association’s mortgage documents.
Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, OCC, FRS, CFPB or Congress, could have a material impact on the Company, the Association, and their operations.
Certain statutes and regulations of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Association and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Association and the Company, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations.
Federal Banking Regulation
Business Activities. A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Association may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate without limitations as a percentage of assets, and may invest in non-residential real estate loans up to 400% of capital in the aggregate. The Association may also invest in commercial business loans up to 20% of assets in the aggregate and consumer loans up to 35% of assets in the aggregate, and in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. An association may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for an association, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio, and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the DFA.
The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Association exercised its opt-out election during 
the first quarter of calendar 2015. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
Federal savings associations must also meet a statutory “tangible capital” standard of 1.5% of total adjusted assets. Tangible capital is generally defined as Tier 1 capital less intangible assets other than certain mortgage servicing rights. 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% in addition to the minimum capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. At September 30, 2019, the Association exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the "capital conservation buffer". In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. As presented in Note 3. Regulatory Matters, at September 30, 2019, the Association exceeded all regulatory capital requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized”.
Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of September 30, 2019, the Association was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings association, the Association must satisfy the qualified thrift lender test. Under the QTL test, the Association must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business.
The Association also may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.
A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions. Under the DFA, non-compliance with the QTL test may subject the Association to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At September 30, 2019, the Association satisfied the QTL test.
Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC and the FRS for approval of a capital distribution if:

• | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years;


• | the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;


• | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or condition imposed by a regulator; or


• | the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.

Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a holding company must still file a notice with the FRS at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
The OCC and the FRS have established similar criteria for approving an application or notice, and may disapprove an application or notice if:
•the savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
•the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
•the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution, if the institution would be undercapitalized after the distribution.
The Association, in compliance with the preceding requirements, paid an $85 million cash dividend to the Company during the fiscal years ending September 30, 2019 and 2018 and an $81 million cash dividend to the Company during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2017. There were no dividends paid to the Company by Third Capital during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 or 2017.
The Company's sixth stock repurchase program, for the repurchase of 10,000,000 shares of its equity stock, was announced on September 9, 2014 and completed August 3, 2015. The seventh stock repurchase program, for 10,000,000 shares, was announced on July 30, 2015 and completed January 6, 2017. The eighth stock repurchase program, also for 10,000,000 shares, was announced on October 27, 2016 and began on January 6, 2017.
Under current FRS regulations, Third Federal Savings, MHC is required to obtain the approval of its members (depositors and certain loan customers of the Association) every 12 months to enable Third Federal Savings, MHC to waive its right to receive dividends on the Company’s common stock that Third Federal Savings, MHC owns. Third Federal Savings, MHC has received this approval of its members at meetings held July 16, 2019, July 11, 2018, July 19, 2017, July 26, 2016 and August 5, 2015. Third Federal Savings, MHC has the approval to waive the receipt of up to a total of $1.10 per share of dividends from the Company over the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2020. Third Federal Savings, MHC waived its right to receive a $0.27 per share dividend payment on September 17, 2019. As a result of the 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 approvals, Third Federal Savings, MHC previously waived its right to receive four separate $0.25 per share dividend payments during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2019, four separate $0.17 per share dividend payments during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2018, four separate $0.125 per share dividend payments during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017 and four separate $0.10 per share dividend payments during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2016. 
Liquidity. A federal savings association is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. The Association maintains a liquid asset portfolio comprised of agency securities that are collateralized by mortgages, in addition to cash and cash equivalents, to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund business operations. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches, mergers, minority stock offerings or second-step conversion, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice.
The Association received a "Needs to Improve" Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination that covered home mortgage lending data for the period January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014.
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings association’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by FRS regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the FRS Act and its implementing Regulation W. An affiliate is a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Association. Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are affiliates of the Association. In general, loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are limited to 10% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral in specified amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the transaction must be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the savings association. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that 
are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Savings associations are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
The Association’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the FRS Act and Regulation O of the FRS. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders:

(i) | subject to certain exceptions for loan programs made available to all employees, be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and


(ii) | do not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Association’s capital.

In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Association’s Board of Directors.
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including shareholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems, audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan. 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations. For this purpose, a savings association is placed in one of the following five categories based on the savings association’s capital:

• | well capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% total risk-based capital, and 6.5% common equity Tier 1 ratios, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued under certain statutes and regulations, to maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure);


• | adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital and 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratios);


• | undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% total risk-based capital, or 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratios);


• | significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% total risk-based capital or 3% common equity Tier 1 ratios); and


• | critically undercapitalized (less than or equal to 2% tangible capital to total assets).

The final rule that strengthened regulatory capital requirements adjusted the prompt corrective actions categories to incorporate the new standards, as reflected above.
Generally, the banking regulator is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings association that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the 
OCC within 45 days of the date a savings association receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the savings association will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the savings association. Any holding company for a savings association required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings association, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
As of September 30, 2019, the Association exceeded all regulatory requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized” as presented in the table below (dollar amounts in thousands).
 | Actual | | Required (Well Capitalized)
 | Amount | | Ratio | | Amount | | Ratio 
Total Capital to Risk Weighted Assets | $ | 1,557,868 | | | 19.56 | % | | $ | 796,329 | | | 10.00 | %
Tier 1 (Leverage) Capital to Net Average Assets | 1,518,952 | | | 10.54 | % | | 720,442 | | | 5.00 | %
Tier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets | 1,518,952 | | | 19.07 | % | | 637,063 | | | 8.00 | %
Common Equity Tier I to Risk-Weighted Assets | 1,518,938 | | | 19.07 | % | | 517,614 | | | 6.50 | %

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The DFA permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions, and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008.
The FDIC, as a requirement of the DFA, bases its assessments on each institution’s total assets less Tier 1 capital, with an assessment schedule that ranges from 2.5 basis points for the least risky institutions to 45 basis points for the riskiest. Institutions with over $10 billion of total assets, such as the Association, are classified for assessment purposes as "Large Institutions", and unless otherwise classified, are subjected to a large institution pricing system that includes a separate “scorecard” methodology. In conjunction with the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio reaching 1.15%, the assessment range was lowered to 1.5 to 40 basis points, effective July 1, 2016. In addition, “Large Institutions” (those with assets of $10 billion or more) were assessed a surcharge required by the DFA until the earlier of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaching 1.35% or December 31, 2018. The surcharge was 4.5 basis points of the Large Institution’s “surcharge base,” which is generally its regular assessment base reduced by $10 billion. The FDIC announced that the 1.35% ratio was reached as of September 30, 2018 and the surcharge ended with payment of the December 31, 2018 invoice.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Association does not believe that it is taking, or is subject to, any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.
All FDIC-insured institutions have been required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on obligations issued by the FICO for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The last of the remaining FICO bonds matured in September 2019. The quarterly FICO assessments ended with the payment of the March 2019 invoice.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Association paid $81.4 thousand related to the FICO bonds and $8.3 million applicable to deposit insurance assessments. The deposit insurance payments are assessed on an arrears basis. At September 30, 2019, the balance of the Association's accrued deposit insurance assessment was $2.1 million.
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings associations are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, 
on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Association is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 11 regional FHLBs. The FHLB System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of Cincinnati, the Association is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB.
As of September 30, 2019, outstanding borrowings (including accrued interest) from the FHLB of Cincinnati were $3.90 billion and the Association was in compliance with the stock investment requirement.
Proposed Federal Regulation
On September 10, 2018, the OCC issued a proposed rule implementing a section of the Economic Growth, Relief and Consumer Protection Act that permits an eligible federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $20 billion or less as of December 31, 2017, to elect to operate with national bank powers without converting to a national bank charter. The proposed rule was finalized in May 2019. No such election had been made by the Association as of September 30, 2019.
Other Regulations
Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Association are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Association’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:

• | Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;


• | Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;


• | Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;


• | Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;


• | Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and


• | rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.

The operations of the Association also are subject to:

• | The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;

Among other provisions, the USA PATRIOT Act and the related regulations of the OCC require savings associations operating in the United States to develop new anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations; and

Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation
General. Third Federal Savings, MHC, and the Company are non-diversified savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are registered with the FRS and subject to FRS regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the FRS has enforcement authority over Third Federal Savings, MHC, the Company and the Association. Among other things, this authority permits the FRS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the Association. As federal corporations, Third Federal Savings, MHC and the Company are generally not subject to state business organization laws.
Permitted Activities. Pursuant to Section 10(o) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act and FRS regulations, a mutual holding company, such as Third Federal Savings, MHC and its mid-tier companies, such as the Company, may, with appropriate regulatory approval, engage in the following activities:

(i) | investing in the stock of a savings association;


(ii) | acquiring a mutual association through the merger of such association into a savings association subsidiary of such holding company or an interim savings association subsidiary of such holding company;


(iii) | merging with or acquiring another holding company, one of whose subsidiaries is a savings association;


(iv) | investing in a corporation, the capital stock of which is available for purchase by a savings association under federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary savings association has its home offices;


(v) | furnishing or performing management services for a savings association subsidiary of such company;


(vi) | holding, managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings association subsidiary of such company;


(vii) | holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings association subsidiary of such company;


(viii) | acting as trustee under deeds of trust;


(ix) | any other activity:

(A) that the FRS, by regulation, has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the FRS, by regulation, prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies; or
(B) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized (by regulation) to directly engage on March 5, 1987;
(x) if the savings and loan holding company meets the criteria to qualify as a financial holding company, any activity permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act, including securities and insurance underwriting; and
(xi) purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by the FRS. If a mutual holding company acquires or merges with another holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in activities listed in (i) through (x) above, and has a period of two years to cease any nonconforming activities and divest any nonconforming investments.
The Home Owners’ Loan Act prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the FRS. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the Home Owners’ Loan Act or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRS must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
The FRS is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions:

(i) | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and


(ii) | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.

The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
Capital. Savings and loan holding companies were historically not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The DFA, however, required the FRS to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to depository institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities could no longer be included as Tier 1 capital, as was previously permitted for bank holding companies. 
The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the DFA’s directive as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions generally applied to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased in between 2016 and 2019.
Dividends and Repurchases. The FRS has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies that it has made applicable to savings and loan holding companies as well. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company's net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company's overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also provides for regulatory review prior to a holding company redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Source of Strength. The DFA extended the “source of strength” doctrine, which has traditionally been applicable to bank holding companies, to savings and loan holding companies as well. The FRS has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
Waivers of Dividends by Third Federal Savings, MHC. Federal regulations require Third Federal Savings, MHC to notify the FRS of any proposed waiver of its receipt of dividends from the Company. The OTS, the previous regulator for Third Federal Savings, MHC, allowed dividend waivers provided the mutual holding company’s Board of Directors determined that the waiver was consistent with its fiduciary duties and the waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of its subsidiary institution. In February 2008, the Company declared its first quarterly dividend and Third Federal Savings, MHC waived its right to receive each dividend paid by the Company. Section 625(a) of DFA preserved, for mutual holding companies, including Third Federal Savings, MHC, that had reorganized into mutual holding company form, issued minority stock and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009, the right to waive dividends if the waiver was not detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association and the board of directors expressly determines that the waiver is consistent with the fiduciary duties of the board to the mutual members of the mutual holding company. However, on August 12, 2011, the FRS issued an interim final rule that added a requirement that a majority of the mutual holding company’s members eligible to vote must approve a dividend waiver by a mutual holding company within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived. The FRS is reviewing comments on the interim final rule, which were required to be submitted by November 1, 2011, as part of its rulemaking process, and there can be no assurance that the final rule will not require such a member vote. On July 16, 2019, Third Federal Savings, MHC received the approval of its members (depositors and certain loan customers of the Association) with respect to the waiver of dividends, and subsequently received the non-objection of the FRB-Cleveland, to waive receipt of dividends on the Company’s common stock the MHC owns up to a total of $1.10 per share during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2020. Third Federal Savings, MHC previously received the approval of its members at: (1) a July 11, 2018 meeting to waive receipt of dividends up to a total of $1.00 per share during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2019, (2) a July 19, 2017 meeting to waive receipt of dividends up to a total of $0.68 per share during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2018; (3) a July 26, 2016 meeting to waive receipt of dividends up to $0.50 per share during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2017; and (4) an August 5, 2015 meeting to waive receipt of dividends up to $0.40 per share during the four quarterly periods ending June 30, 2016.
Conversion of Third Federal Savings, MHC to Stock Form. Federal regulations permit Third Federal Savings, MHC to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization (a “Conversion Transaction”). There can be no assurance when, if ever, a Conversion Transaction will occur, and the Board of Directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a Conversion Transaction. In a Conversion Transaction, a new stock holding company would be formed as the successor to the Company, Third Federal Savings, MHC’s corporate existence would end, and certain depositors of the 
Association would receive the right to subscribe for additional shares of common stock of the new holding company. In a Conversion Transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than Third Federal Savings, MHC (“Minority Stockholders”) would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that Minority Stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in the Company immediately prior to the Conversion Transaction. Under a provision of the DFA applicable to Third Federal Savings, MHC, Minority Stockholders should not be diluted because of any dividends waived by Third Federal Savings, MHC (and waived dividends should not be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio), in the event Third Federal Savings, MHC converts to stock form. Any such Conversion Transaction would require various member and stockholder approvals, as well as regulatory approval.
