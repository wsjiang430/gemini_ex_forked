Our Products

We create innovative products that help our customers build faster, build stronger, and work smarter. We accomplish this by listening to what our customers want and need and researching how professionals work, then we create tools that help them save time, hassle and money.

TOUGHBUILT® manufactures and distributes an array of high-quality and rugged tool belts, tool bags, and other personal tool organizer products. We also manufacture and distribute a complete line of knee pads for various construction applications, a variety of metal goods, including utility knives, aviation snips and shears and digital measures such as lasers and levels. Our line of job site tools and material support products consists of a full line of miter saw and table saw stands, saw horses/job site tables, roller stands and workbench. All of our products are designed and engineered in the United States and manufactured in China, India and the Philippines under our quality control supervision. We do not need government approval for any of our products.

Our soft-sided tool storage line is designed for a wide range of Do-It-Yourself and professional needs. This line of pouches and tool and accessories bags is designed to organize our customers’ tools faster and easier. Interchangeable pouches clip on and off any belt, bag ladder wall, or vehicle. Our products let our customers carry what they want so they have it when they want it. ToughBuilt’s wide mouth tool carry-all bags come in sizes from 12 inches to 30 inches. They all have steel-reinforced handles and padded shoulder straps which allow for massive loads to be carried with ease. Rigid plastic hard-body lining protects everything inside. Double mesh pockets included inside provide complete visibility for stored items. They include a lockable zipper for added security and safety and secondary side handles for when it takes more than one to carry the load.

All of these products have innovative designs with unique features that provide extra functionality and enhanced user experience. Patented features such as our exclusive “Cliptech” mechanism incorporated in some of the products in this line are unique in these products for the industry and have distinguished the line from other similarly situated products thus we believe, increasing appeal among the other products of this category in the professional community and among the enthusiasts.

Soft Goods

The flagship of the product line is the soft goods line that consists of over 100 variations of tool pouches, tool rigs, tool belts and accessories, tool bags, totes, variety of storage solutions, and office organizers/bags for laptop/tablet/cellphones, etc. Management believes that the breadth of the line is one of the deepest in the industry and has specialized designs to suit professionals from all sectors of the industry including plumbers, electricians, framers, builders, and more.

We have a selection of over 10 models of kneepads, some with revolutionary and patented design features that allow the users to interchange components to suit particular conditions of use. Management believes that these kneepads are among the best performing kneepads in the industry. Our “all terrain” knee pad protection with snapshell technology is part of our interchangeable kneepad system which helps to customize the jobsite needs. They are made with superior quality using multilevel layered construction, heavy-duty webbing, and abrasion-resistant PVC rubber.

Metal Goods

Sawhorses and Work Support Products

The second major category consists of Sawhorses and Work Support products with unique designs and robust construction targeted for the most discerning users in the industry. The innovative designs and construction of the more than 18 products in this category have led to the sawhorses becoming among the best sellers of category everywhere they are sold. The newest additions in this category include several stands and work support products that are quickly gaining recognition in the industry and are expected to position themselves in the top tier products in a short time. Our sawhorse line, miter saw, table saw & roller stands and workbench are built to very high standards. Our sawhorse/jobsite table is fast to set up, holds 2,400 pounds, has adjustable heights, is made of all-metal construction, and has a compact design. We believe that these lines of products are slowly becoming the standard in the construction industry.

These digital measures are targeted towards the PROs for accurate job site measuring, to make sure the job is done right and in time. These digital measures help calculated what amount of construction product is needed to finish the job. Such as measure for floors, tile, and paint.

Below is just a sample of our offered products:

Saw Horses | Knee Pads 
Utility Knives and Other Tools | Levelers and Measuring Tools

Our Business Strategy

Our product strategy is to develop product lines in a number of categories rather than focus on a single line of goods. We believe that this approach allows for rapid growth, wider brand recognition, and may ultimately result in increased sales and profits within an accelerated time period. We believe that building brand awareness of our current ToughBuilt lines of products will expand our share of the pertinent markets. Our business strategy includes the following key elements:

● | A commitment to technological innovation achieved through consumer insight, creativity, and speed to market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A broad selection of products in both brand and private labels;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Prompt response;
--+-----------------


● | Superior customer service; and
--+-------------------------------


● | Value pricing.
--+---------------


We will continue to consider other market opportunities while focusing on our customers’ specific requirements to increase sales.

Market

In addition to the construction market, our products are marketed to the “Do-It-Yourself” and home improvement market place. The home improvement industry has fared much better in the aftermath of the Great Recession than the housing market. The U.S. housing stock of more than 130 million homes requires regular investment merely to offset normal depreciation. And many households that might have traded up to more desirable homes during the downturn decided instead to make improvements to their current homes. Meanwhile, federal and state stimulus programs encouraged homeowners and rental property owners to invest in energy-efficient upgrades that they might otherwise have deferred. Finally, many rental property owners, responding to a surge in demand from households either facing foreclosure or nervous about buying amid the housing market uncertainty, reinvested in their units.

TOUGHBUILT® products are available worldwide in many major retailers ranging from home improvement and construction products and services stores to major online outlets. Currently, we have placement in Lowes, Home Depot, Menards, Bunnings (Australia), Princess Auto (Canada), Dong Shin Tool PIA (S. Korea) and others, as well as seeking to grow our sales in global markets such as Western and Central Europe, Russia and Eastern Europe, South America and the Middle East.

Retailers by region include:  


● | United States: Lowe’s, Home Depot, Menards, Harbor Freight, ACE Hardware, Acme, TSC;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Canada: Princess Auto;
--+-----------------------


● | United Kingdom: Wickes, TOOL STATION, Huws Gray, Selco Builders Warehouse, MKM, City Electrical Factors, and Carpet & Flooring;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Europe: Elecktro3 and NCC Hardware; 
● | South America: Sodimac; 
● | Mexico: Sears; 
● | Middle East: Lamed; 


● | Australia: Kincrome, and Bunnings;
--+-----------------------------------


● | New Zealand: Kincrome, and Bunnings;
--+-------------------------------------


● | Russia: VSEInstrumenti.ru; and
--+-------------------------------


● | South Korea: Dong Shin Tool PIA Co., Ltd.
--+------------------------------------------


We are actively expanding into other markets including South Africa.

We are currently in product line reviews and discussions with Home Depot Canada, Do It Best, True Value, and other major retailers both domestically and internationally. A product line review requires the supplier to submit a comprehensive proposal which includes product offerings, prices, competitive market studies, and relevant industry trends, and other information. Management anticipates, within the near term, adding to its customer base up to three major retailers, along with several distributors and private retailers within six sectors and among fifty-six targeted countries.

Innovation and Brand Strength

Management believes that the robust capabilities at ToughBuilt eclipse those of many competitors as not every distributor or factory has the ability to quickly identify industry and end-user opportunities and execute quickly to deliver winning product lines consistently. Also, in our view, most distributors and factories do not have a recognizable and reputable brand or the proven ability to reach major retailers globally to position their products and brands. We believe that we are able to take a design from concept to market within a very short period of time.
Product and Services Diversification

TOUGHBUILT® is a singular brand with a driven team that is poised to scale into a highly recognized global entity. We aim to grow ToughBuilt with several significant subsidiaries in the next few years to become the hub/platform for professionals, Do-It-Yourselfers, and passionate builders everywhere. Management anticipates that future subsidiaries will focus on licensing, gear, mobile, equipment rentals, and maintenance services.

--+------------------------------


● | Striking Tools
--+---------------


● | Long Handle Garden and Landscaping Tools
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Pliers and Clamps
--+------------------


In 2022, we launched the following tools:

● | 500 ft. Rotary Laser Level Kit 
--+----------------------------------------------------
● | 40+ new SKUs into the Handheld Screwdrivers segment
● | 20 new SKUs into the Handheld Wrenches segment 

Mobile Device Products

Since 2013, we have been planning, designing, engineering, and sourcing the development of a new line of ToughBuilt mobile devices and accessories to be used in the construction industry and by building enthusiasts. However, due to microchip shortages, we have suspended this segment and will continue development in the near future.
Sales Strategy

The devices, accessories, and bolt-on digital tools will be sold through relevant home improvement big box stores, direct marketing to construction companies, direct marketing of trade/wholesale outlets and to professional outlets.
Suppliers

We use several suppliers in producing our products. We believe that we would be able to retain other suppliers in the event of a slow-down or loss of one or more of its current suppliers without a material adverse effect on our business operations, timeliness of delivery or quality of products. 
Intellectual Property

We hold several patents and trademarks of various durations and believe that we hold, have applied for or license all of the patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We utilize trademarks (licensed and owned) on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and our Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our ToughBuilt®, Cliptech®, and Fearless® trademarks to be among our most valuable intangible assets. Trademarks registered both in and outside the U.S. are generally valid for 10 years, depending on the jurisdiction, and are generally subject to an indefinite number of renewals for a like period on appropriate application.

In 2019, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted two new design patents (U.S. D840,961 S and US D841,635 S) that cover ToughBuilt’s ruggedized mobile devices, which are valid for a period of 15 years. We also have several patents pending with the USPTO and anticipate three or four of them to be granted in the near future.

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information relating to our design and processes for our products. Copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate.

Domain names are a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including ToughBuilt. Domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property. The recognition and value of the ToughBuilt name, trademark, and domain name are our core strengths.

We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality, non-competition, and proprietary rights assignment agreements with our employees and independent contractors. We have entered into and will continue to enter into confidentiality agreements with our suppliers to protect our intellectual property.

We have not entered into any royalty agreements with respect to our intellectual property.

Competition

The tool equipment and accessories industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete with a significant number of other tool equipment and accessories manufacturers and suppliers to the construction, home improvement, and Do-It-Yourself industry, many of which have the following:

● | Significantly greater financial resources than we have;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | More comprehensive product lines;
--+----------------------------------


● | Longer-standing relationships with suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broader distribution capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------


● | Stronger brand recognition and loyalty; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | The ability to invest substantially more in product advertising and sales.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our competitors’ greater capabilities in the above areas enable them to better differentiate their products from ours, gain stronger brand loyalty, withstand periodic downturns in the construction and home improvement equipment and product industries, compete effectively on the basis of price and production, and more quickly develop new products. Our financial condition and operating results can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product features, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.

Seasonality

Our company’s revenues are not seasonal. However, we usually experience a spike in sales when we introduce new products. 

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2023, we had a total of 259 employees, including our four executive officers, and a total of eight independent contractors and consultants. We engage consultants on an as-needed basis to supplement existing staff. All of our employees, consultants, and contractors that are involved with sensitive and/or proprietary information have signed non-disclosure agreements. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee well-being, health, and safety.

Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our Company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
