Our Business
Roper Technologies, Inc. (“Roper,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a diversified technology company. Roper has a proven, long-term, successful track record of compounding cash flow and shareholder value. We operate market leading businesses that design and develop vertical software and technology enabled products for a variety of defensible niche markets.
We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow by enabling continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other businesses that offer high value-added software, services, technology-enabled products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many defensible niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets. In the last three years, we have deployed approximately $10,500 of capital toward acquisitions, including approximately $3,750 in 2022 for the acquisition of Frontline Education, a leading provider of Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) solutions for school administration and approximately $5,400 in 2020 for the acquisition of Vertafore, Inc., a leading provider of SaaS solutions for the property and casualty insurance industry. Additionally, we deployed approximately $1,400 towards bolt-on acquisitions to help build on the strategic position of several of our businesses.
On November 22, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of a majority 51% equity stake in its industrial businesses, including its entire historical Process Technologies reportable segment and the industrial businesses within its historical Measurement & Analytical Solutions reportable segment, to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC. The businesses included in this transaction were Alpha, AMOT, CCC, Cornell, Dynisco, FTI, Hansen, Hardy, Logitech, Metrix, PAC, Roper Pump, Struers, Technolog, Uson, and Viatran (collectively “Indicor”). Following the sale of the majority stake, the Company retained an initial 49% minority equity interest in the new standalone parent company, Indicor, LLC. This transaction is referred to herein as the “Indicor Transaction.”
During 2021, Roper entered into definitive agreements to divest our TransCore, Zetec and CIVCO Radiotherapy businesses (“2021 Divestitures”). As of March 31, 2022, Roper had completed the 2021 Divestitures. 
The aggregate of the 2021 Divestitures and Indicor Transaction have greatly reduced the cyclicality and asset intensity of the Company. In addition, the Company has an increased mix of recurring revenue and a higher margin profile. The financial results for Indicor and the 2021 Divestitures are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, discussion within Part I relates to continuing operations. Information regarding discontinued operations is included in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We were incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Market Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development
Leadership with Technology and Products for Niche Markets - We maintain a leading position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the applications expertise used to create high value products and solutions for our customers, the underlying critical nature of our offerings, and the inherent customer intimacy of our chosen niche markets. Our businesses realize growth from new and existing customers in their niche markets through successfully executing go-to-market strategies, developing new products and applications, and delivering professional services.
Diversified End Markets and Geographic Reach - We have a global presence, with sales to customers outside the United States (“U.S.”). totaling $806.5 in 2022.

Our Reportable Segments
During the second quarter of 2022, we updated our reportable segment structure following the announcement of the Indicor Transaction. The Company’s new reporting segment structure is classified based on business model and delivery of performance obligations.

Materials and Suppliers
We believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some components and sub-assemblies are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers for which we regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible. We also believe these conditions affect our competitors. Although supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues, we may continue to be impacted by supply chain challenges including increased material costs, component shortages and transportation disruptions and delays.
Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog
Remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4,214.0 and $3,539.1, respectively.
Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months. Backlog was $2,912.6 at December 31, 2022, and $2,325.1 at December 31, 2021.
Distribution and Sales
Distribution and sales occur primarily through direct sales offices, manufacturers’ representatives, resellers and distributors. 
Governmental Regulations
We face extensive government regulation around the world relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our software, services, and products. The following sections describe certain significant regulations to which we are subject, but these are not the only regulations to which our businesses must comply. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that our businesses are subject to, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Privacy and Data Security
We are subject to privacy and data security laws around the world that may impose operational burdens on our businesses. In 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) became effective in the European Union (“EU”) and United Kingdom and imposed restrictions on how companies use and process personal information. In particular, legal challenges to the way regulators implemented GDPR have created additional operational burdens for companies transferring personal data back and forth between the EU, U.S., and India. In the U.S., several states have adopted legislation that imposes similar (but not identical) restrictions to GDPR on companies conducting business or serving customers in those states. For example, in 2020 the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) became effective and required companies to make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices; allowed consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and provided a private right of action for data breaches. Changes to the CCPA effective in 2023 have added to the processing restrictions and notifications requirements – particularly when companies engage in online advertising. Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have passed similar legislation that will also become effective in 2023. Canada (Quebec) and China have also significantly updated their privacy laws. The compliance and other burdens on our businesses imposed by these privacy laws and regulations may be substantial as we work to comply with differing legal and implementation requirements across multiple jurisdictions.
Healthcare Regulations 
The manufacture, sale, lease and service of medical diagnostic and surgical devices intended for commercial use are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and by a variety of regulatory agencies in other countries for some of our businesses. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, known as the FD&C Act, manufacturers of medical products and devices must comply with certain regulations governing the design, testing, manufacturing, packaging, servicing and marketing of medical products. FDA product approvals may be withdrawn or suspended if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. We are also subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws which broadly relate to our interactions with healthcare practitioners and other participants in the healthcare system, including, among others, anti-kickback law, and laws regulating the confidentiality of sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released and/or collected, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and the GDPR.
Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Laws and Regulations
We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and anti-corruption laws, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the UK Anti-Bribery Act. Any violation of these laws by us or our agents or distributors could create substantial liability for us, subject our officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Increased business in higher risk countries could subject us and our officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability. In addition, becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be quite costly. 
Export Controls and Trade Policies
We are subject to numerous domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). Our businesses may also be impacted by additional domestic or foreign trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices, including trade restrictions, tariffs and sanctions. 
Environmental Regulations
Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.
Customers
During 2022, no customer accounted for 10% or more of any segment or total Company net revenues.
Competition
Generally, our products and solutions face significant competition, although in certain niche markets there are a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the size of the niche market we serve. We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.
Intellectual Property
In addition to trade secrets, including unpatented know-how and other intellectual property like software source code, we own or license the rights under numerous patents, trademarks, trade dress and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with, including employees, distributors, representatives, independent contractors and customers to protect our intellectual property. We believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single item of intellectual property, including a trade secret, patent, trademark, trade dress, or copyright.
Human Capital Management
Roper is a diversified technology company that utilizes a decentralized operating model across our many businesses which serve a diverse set of end markets. Subject to oversight and guidance from Roper executive management, each business operates as an individual unit with its managers empowered to make day to day operating decisions, including decisions with respect to human capital management. As a result, apart from guidance with respect to: (i) compliance with regulatory requirements or corporate policies; and (ii) the implementation of compensation and benefit programs provided by corporate management, managers at individual businesses are the primary decision makers with respect to human capital management and development. Though our individual businesses are primarily responsible for these decisions, because of the importance of human capital to our enterprise, we provide guidance and share best practices on key aspects of selection, development, engagement and diversity of talent within our workforce.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 15,800 people worldwide on a consolidated basis, of which approximately 10,500 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 5,300 were outside of the U.S. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our businesses implemented broad work-from-home initiatives. Many businesses have retained work-from-home flexibility for their employees and have implemented hybrid work-from-home and in-office arrangements.
Outside the U.S., we have some employees, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.
Roper has identified and implemented other human capital priorities, including providing competitive wages and benefits, and promoting a diverse and inclusive work environment. The Company is committed to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers. We continue to focus on building a pipeline for talent to create more opportunities for workplace diversity and to support greater representation within the Company.
