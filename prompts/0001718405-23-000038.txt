ITEM 1. BUSINESS
About the Company
Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (formerly known as Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corporation) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 28, 2017. In this 2022 Form 10-K, “we”, “us”, “our”, the “Company”, “Hycroft”, and "HYMC" refer to Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries. We are a U.S.-based gold and silver development company that owns the Hycroft Mine in the prolific mining region of Northern Nevada. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) and Notes to the Financial Statements (“Notes”) included in Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements of this 2022 Form 10-K.
On May 29, 2020, we, consummated a business combination transaction (the “Recapitalization Transaction”) that resulted in MUDS Acquisition Sub, Inc. (“Acquisition Sub”) acquiring all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the direct subsidiaries of Hycroft Mining Corporation (“Seller”) and substantially all of the other assets of Seller and assuming substantially all of the liabilities of Seller. In conjunction with the Recapitalization Transaction, Seller’s indebtedness existing prior to the Recapitalization Transaction was either repaid, exchanged for indebtedness of the Company, exchanged for shares 
of common stock or converted into shares of Seller common stock, and our post-Recapitalization Transaction indebtedness included amounts drawn under the Credit Agreement among MUDS, MUDS Holdco Inc., Allied VGH LLC, Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation, Hycroft Resources and Development, LLC Sprott Private Resource Lending II (Collector) Inc., and Sprott Resources Lending Corp. (“Sprott Credit Agreement”) and the assumption of the newly issued 10% Senior Secured Notes (“Subordinated Notes”). 
Our property, the Hycroft Mine, has historically operated as an open-pit oxide mining and heap leach processing operation and is located approximately 54 miles northwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. Mining operations at the Hycroft Mine were restarted in 2019 on a pre-commercial scale and discontinued in November 2021 as a result of the then current and expected ongoing cost pressures for many of the reagents and consumables used at the Hycroft Mine and to further determine the most effective processing method for the sulfide ore. In March 2023, Hycroft, along with its third-party consultants, completed and filed the Hycroft Property Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary Humboldt and Pershing Counties, Nevada with an effective date of March 27, 2023 (the “2023 Hycroft TRS”) and prepared in accordance with the SEC’s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants as set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (“Modernization Rules”). The 2023 Hycroft TRS provides an initial assessment of the mineral resource estimate utilizing a milling and pressure oxidation (“POX”) process for sulfide mineralization and heap leaching process for oxide and transition mineralization. The 2023 Hycroft TRS included: (i) additional exploration drilling results from 2021 and 2022; (ii) additional assay information associated with historical drilling that was previously missing; (iii) other updates after additional review of historical assay certificates; and (iv) other adjustments. The 2023 Hycroft TRS supersedes and replaces the Initial Assessment Technical Report Summary for the Hycroft Mine, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Modernization Rules, with an effective date of February 18, 2022 (“2022 Hycroft TRS”) and the 2022 Hycroft TRS should no longer be relied upon. Our ongoing disclosures and many of management’s estimates and judgements as of and for the period ended December 31, 2022 are based on the 2023 Hycroft TRS. The Company will continue to build on the work to date and investigate opportunities identified through progressing the technical and data analyses leading up to the 2023 Hycroft TRS and will provide an updated technical report at an appropriate time. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we completed processing of gold and silver ore previously placed on leach pads prior to ceasing mining operations in November 2021 and we sold 17,728 ounces of gold and 44,084 ounces of silver. As of December 31, 2022, the Hycroft Mine had measured and indicated mineral resources of 10.6 million ounces of gold and 360.7 million ounces of silver and inferred mineral resources of 3.4 million ounces of gold and 96.1 million ounces of silver, which are contained in oxide, transitional, and sulfide ores.
Segment Information
The Hycroft Mine is our only operating segment and includes the operations, development, and exploration activities and accounts for 100% of our Revenues and Production costs. Corporate and Other includes corporate General and administrative costs. See Note 19 – Segment Information to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments.
Principal Products, Revenues, and Market Overview
The principal products produced during 2022 and 2021 at the Hycroft Mine were unrefined gold and silver bars (doré) and gold and silver laden carbons and slags, both of which were sent to third party refineries and sold at prevailing spot prices after adjustments for refining and other associated fees, to financial institutions or to precious metals traders. Doré bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags were sent to refineries to produce bullion that meet the required market standards of 99.95% pure gold and 99.90% pure silver. Under the terms of our refining agreements, doré bars and gold and silver laden carbons and slags were refined for a fee, and our share of the separately recovered refined gold and refined silver were credited to our account or delivered to our buyers. 
Product Revenues and Customers
In 2022, Revenues from gold and silver recovered from our pre-commercial scale heap leaching operations made up 97% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue and, as such, we consider gold our principal product. In 2022, all of our Revenues were derived from metal sales to three customers; however, we do not believe we have any dependencies on these customers due to the liquidity of the metal markets and the availability of other metal buyers and financial institutions. As the Company ceased active mining operations in November 2021 and completed the processing of gold and silver ounces from the leach pads, we do not expect to have significant Revenues from gold and silver sales until restarting mining operations.
Gold and Silver Uses
Gold and silver have two main categories of use: fabrication and investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and coins. Fabricated silver also has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, mirrors, cameras, electronics, energy, engines, novelty explosives and coins. Gold and silver investors buy gold and silver bullion, coins and jewelry.
Gold and Silver Supply and Demand
The supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and metal recycling and the draw-down of existing stocks of gold held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals. Based on publicly available information published by the World Gold Council, gold production from mines increased 1.2% in 2022 compared with 2021 totaling approximately 3,612 metric tons (or 116.1 million troy ounces) and represented approximately 75.9% of the 2022 global gold supply of 4,755 metric tons. According to the World Gold Council, gold demand in 2022 was approximately 4,741 metric tons (or 152.4 million troy ounces) and totaled approximately $274.4 billion in value. In 2022, gold demand by sector was comprised of jewelry (46%), investments including bar and coin and ETFs (23%), central bank purchases (24%), and technology (7%).
The supply of silver consists of a combination of current production from mining (approximately 82%) and metal recycling and other (approximately 18%). Based on publicly available information, estimated silver production from mines increased approximately 2.5% in 2022 compared with 2021 totaling approximately 843 million troy ounces and represented approximately 82% of the 2022 global silver supply of 1,030 million troy ounces. Silver demand in 2022 was approximately 1,101 million troy ounces and totaled approximately $26.3 billion in value. In 2022, silver demand by sector was comprised of photovoltaics (12%), other industrial (37%), jewelry (18%), silverware (5%), photography (3%), and investments (25%).
Gold and Silver Prices 
The price of gold and silver is volatile and is affected by many factors beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions, inflation or deflation and monetary policies, fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, global and regional demand, and the political and economic conditions of major gold and silver producing countries throughout the world. The following table presents the annual high, low, and average afternoon fix prices for gold and silver over the past three years on the London Bullion Market (in U.S. dollars per ounce).

 | GOLD PRICES | | SILVER PRICES
Year | High | | Low | Average | | High | Low | | Average
2020 | $ | 2,067 | | $ | 1,474 | | $ | 1,770 | | $ | 28.89 | $ | 12.01 | $ | 20.55
2021 | $ | 1,943 | | $ | 1,684 | | $ | 1,799 | | $ | 29.59 | $ | 21.53 | $ | 25.04
2022 | $ | 2,039 | | $ | 1,628 | | $ | 1,800 | | $ | 26.18 | $ | 17.77 | $ | 21.71
2023 (through Mar. 24th) | $ | 1,994 | | $ | 1,811 | | $ | 1,884 | | $ | 24.44 | $ | 20.09 | $ | 22.48

On March 24, 2023, the afternoon fix price for gold and silver on the London Bullion Market was $1,994 per ounce and $23.17 per ounce, respectively.
Competition
The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately one third of total worldwide mined gold production. We are a gold and silver development company with a single property. The Hycroft Mine has large gold and silver mineral resources included in the 2023 Hycroft TRS. We have not fully developed our milling and POX operations and we have not established our long-term production and cost structure. Our costs are expected to be determined by the location, grade and nature of our ore body, processing technologies applied to our ore, and costs including energy, reagents, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long-term is based on our ability to develop and cost effectively operate the Hycroft Mine in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.
We compete with other mining companies in connection with hiring and retaining qualified employees. There is substantial competition for qualified employees in the mining industry, some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than us and a more stable history. As a result, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Industry Related Risks — The Company faces intense competition in the recruitment and retention of qualified employees, for additional discussion related to our current and potential competition.
Employees
At December 31, 2022, we had approximately 74 employees, of which 64 were employed at the Hycroft Mine. None of our employees are represented by unions.
We believe “the miner is the most important thing to come out of a mine” and we support that belief through our philosophy of “continuous improvement.” Our mandated mine safety and health programs include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation, and program auditing. These programs are a focus for our leadership and top management and are essential at all levels to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors operate safely.
One of the metrics we use to measure our safety performance is the industry standard Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (“TRIFR”). The Hycroft Mine’s TRIFR per 200,000 man-hours worked (including contractors) was Nil (0.00) at the end of 2022, as compared to 0.64 at the end of 2021 and the mining industry average of approximately 2.02 for 2022. In 2021, we recruited new leadership from strong safety cultures in the mining industry that helped us successfully rebuild the Hycroft Mine safety culture utilizing elements in advanced safety practices and management making them the cornerstone for our safety success. We emphasize safety as a cornerstone of our corporate culture and continue with the practices, and people to elevate our safety performance in all site activities. During 2022 we continued to focus our efforts on safety with enhanced and expanded activities to further develop and reinforce our safety culture.
COVID-19
We have implemented health and safety policies for employees, contractors, and visitors that follow guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). During 2022 and 2021, our operations faced certain limitations due to COVID-19 related absences, however the impact, while negative, did not materially and adversely affect our operations.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Industry Related Risks – The on-going effects of the coronavirus pandemic may adversely impact our business and financial condition, as well as Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion related to COVID-19.
Government Regulation of Mining-Related Activities
Government Regulation 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our current mining, exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in Nevada and the United States. Although we are not aware of any current claims, orders or directions relating to our business with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations, changes to, or more stringent application, interpretation, or enforcement of, such laws and regulations in Nevada, or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future, could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs, which could adversely impact the profitability levels of our projects.
Environmental Regulation 
Our mining projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The federal laws and regulations, among other things:
•impose strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”)); 
•govern the generation, treatment, storage and disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste (the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”));
•restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including mining and processing activities (the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended (the “Clean Air Act”));
•require federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including the issuance of permits to mining facilities and assessing alternatives to these actions (the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, as amended (“NEPA”));
•regulate the use of federal public lands to prevent undue and unnecessary degradation of the public lands (the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended (the “FLPMA”));
•restrict and control the discharge of pollutants and dredged and fill materials into waters of the United States (the Clean Water Act of 1972, as amended (the “Clean Water Act”)); and
•regulate the drilling of subsurface injection wells (the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended (the “Safe Drinking Water Act”) and the Underground Injection Control Program promulgated thereunder). 
We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, to federal laws or regulations may be adopted or imposed by the current governmental administration. At the state level, mining operations in Nevada are regulated by the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Protection (the “Division”), which has the authority to implement and enforce many of the federal regulatory programs described above as well as state environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in delays in obtaining, or failure to obtain, government permits and approvals, delays in beginning or expanding operations, limitations on production levels, incurring additional costs for investigation or cleanup of hazardous substances, payment of fines, penalties or remediation costs for non-compliance, and post-mining closure, reclamation and bonding.
It is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards our employees, public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are, and will be, conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, our past and future activities in the United States may cause us to be subject to liability under such laws and regulations. For information about the risks to our business related to environmental regulation, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors – Industry Related Risks:
•Our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require, or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed;
•Changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect our cost of operations or result in operations delays;
•Environmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability; and
•Our exploration and development operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company received a notice of non-compliance from the closure branch of the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (“NDEP”) Bureau of Mining Regulation and Reclamation (“BMRR”) regarding a historical reclamation matter. As such, the Company has accelerated certain reclamation activities in order to regain compliance. During 2021, there was no known material non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by us. During 2022 and 2021, there were no known material environmental incidents. We did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during 2022 and 2021 and we do not expect to incur any material expenditures in 2023 for such environmental control facilities.
Reclamation
We are required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by amending, backfilling, stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing are completed, mitigating potential impacts to surface water and groundwater resources. These reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. Our reclamation obligations at the Hycroft Mine are secured by surface management surety bonds that meet the financial assurance requirements of the State of Nevada and the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). Our most recent reclamation cost estimate was approved by the BLM and the State of Nevada in July 2020. As of December 31, 2022, our surface management surety bonds totaled $58.7 million, of which $58.3 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the Hycroft Mine, and $0.4 million secures the financial assurance requirements for the adjacent water supply well field and exploration within the project boundary. The Company began performing reclamation activities on its Crofoot leach pad beginning in 2022 and expects to complete the reclamation activities in 2028. No additional material reclamation expenditures are expected to be incurred until after mining and mineral processing are completed. If we incur additional long-term environmental impacts from future mining activities, we will likely have additional reclamation obligations as well as additional financial assurance requirements. For our existing obligations, as well as any future obligations we may incur we may choose to engage in reclamation activities before mining and mineral processing are completed, but these expenses are not anticipated to be material to the overall reclamation obligation. When we perform reclamation work in the future, the work will be planned to conform to our mining operations and will be required to be 
documented when completed under our governing permits with the government regulatory agencies. The reclamation obligation would be adjusted accordingly as allowed under current regulations, and the financial assurance requirements would be adjusted to account for the completed reclamation work. If we are required to comply with material unanticipated financial assurance requirements in the future, our financial position could be adversely affected, or our posted financial assurance may be insufficient. For financial information about our estimated future reclamation costs, see Note 13 – Asset Retirement Obligation to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Mine Safety and Health Administration Regulations
Safety and health are core values which is why we have mandatory mine safety and health programs that include employee and contractor training, risk management, workplace inspection, emergency response, accident investigation and program auditing. We consider these programs to be essential at all levels within Hycroft to ensure that our employees, contractors, and visitors only operate in a safe and healthy workplace. 
Our operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by MSHA under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended (the “Mine Act”). Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as amended (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), issuers are required to disclose specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities in periodic reports. MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. The number of citations and orders charged against mining operations in the U.S., and the dollar penalties assessed for such citations, have generally increased in recent years. The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to provide certain mine safety disclosure, which we have done in Part I – Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures of this 2022 Form 10-K.
Property Interests and Mining Claims
Our development activities are conducted in the State of Nevada. Mineral interests in Nevada may be owned by the United States, the State of Nevada, or private parties. Where prospective mineral properties are held by the United States, mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land. Where prospective mineral properties are owned by the State of Nevada or private parties, some type of property acquisition agreement or access agreement is necessary in order for us to explore or develop such property. Mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests. Additionally, mining claims are self-initiated and self-maintained and, therefore, possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests. It is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and, therefore, it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim. For general information about our mineral properties and mining claims, see Item 2. Properties. For information about the risks to our business related to our property interests and mining claims, see the following risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors – Industry Related Risks:
•There are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations;
•Legislation has been proposed periodically that could, if enacted, significantly affect the cost of our operations on our unpatented mining claims or the amount of Net Proceeds Mineral Tax we pay to the State of Nevada.
Technical Report Summaries (“TRS”) and Qualified Persons
The scientific and technical information concerning our mineral projects in this 2022 Form 10-K have been reviewed and approved by third-party “qualified persons” under the Modernization Rules, including Ausenco Engineering South USA, Inc. (“Ausenco”), Independent Mining Consultants, Inc, (“IMC”), and WestLand Engineering & Environmental Services, Inc. (“WestLand”). For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral resources included in this 2022 Form 10-K, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant factors, please review the 2023 Hycroft TRS incorporated by reference herein.
