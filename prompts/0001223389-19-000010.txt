ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

Company Overview
Conn’s, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with no independent assets or operations other than its investments in its subsidiaries. References to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Conn’s” or “CONN” refer to Conn’s, Inc. and, as apparent from the context, its subsidiaries. Conn’s is a leading specialty retailer that offers a broad selection of quality, branded durable consumer goods and related services in addition to proprietary credit solutions for its core credit-constrained consumers. We operate an integrated and scalable business through our retail stores and website. Our complementary product offerings include furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer electronics and home office products from leading global brands across a wide range of price points. Our credit offering provides financing solutions to a large, under-served population of credit-constrained consumers who typically have limited credit alternatives. We provide customers the opportunity to comparison shop across brands with confidence in our competitive prices as well as affordable monthly payment options, next day delivery and installation in the majority of our markets and product repair service. We believe our large, attractively merchandised stores and credit solutions offer a distinctive value proposition compared to other retailers that target our core customer demographic.
Our fiscal year ends on January 31. References to a fiscal year refer to the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends. 
Operating Segments
We operate two reportable segments: retail and credit. Information regarding segment performance is included in Part II, Item 7., Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Part II, Item 8. in Note 14, Segment Information, of the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Retail Segment. We began as a small plumbing and heating business in 1890 and started selling home appliances to the retail market in 1937 through one store located in Beaumont, Texas. As of January 31, 2019, we operated 123 retail stores located in 14 states. Our stores typically range in size from 25,000 to 50,000 square feet and are predominantly located in areas densely populated by our core customers. 
We utilize a merchandising strategy that offers a wide range of quality, branded products across a broad spectrum of price points. This wide selection allows us to offer products and price points that appeal to the majority of our core consumers. Our primary retail product categories include: 
3


• | Furniture and mattress, including furniture and related accessories for the living room, dining room and bedroom, as well as both traditional and specialty mattresses. We offer brands such as Corinthian, Franklin, Catnapper, Serta and Simmons Beautyrest.


• | Home appliance, including refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, dishwashers and ranges. We offer brands such as Samsung, LG, General Electric, Whirlpool, Maytag and Frigidaire.


• | Consumer electronics, including LED, OLED, QLED, 4K Ultra HD, smart televisions, gaming products and home theater and portable audio equipment. We offer brands such as Samsung, LG, Sony, Microsoft, Bose and Beats.


• | Home office, including computers, printers and accessories. We offer brands such as HP, Dell, Apple, and Microsoft.

We strive to ensure that our customers’ shopping experience at Conn’s is equal to, or exceeds, their experience with other providers of durable consumer goods targeting our core customer demographic. We offer a high level of customer service through our commissioned and trained sales force, next day delivery and installation in the majority of our markets and product repair or replacement services for most items sold in our stores. Flexible payment alternatives offered through our proprietary in-house credit programs and third-party financing alternatives provide our customers the ability to make aspirational purchases. We believe our extensive brand and product selection, competitive pricing, financing alternatives and supporting services, combined with our customer service-focused store, delivery and service associates make us an attractive alternative to appliance and electronics superstores, department stores and other national, regional, local and internet retailers. We believe our attractive credit programs generate strong customer loyalty and repeat business. 
Credit Segment. Our in-house consumer credit programs are an integral part of our business and are a major driver of customer loyalty. We believe our in-house credit programs are a significant competitive advantage that we have developed over our 50-plus years in providing credit. We have developed proprietary underwriting models that provide standardized credit decisions, including down payment, limit amounts and credit terms, based on customer risk and income level. We use our proprietary auto-decision algorithms and in-depth evaluations of creditworthiness performed by qualified in-house credit underwriters to complete all credit decisions. In order to improve the speed and consistency of underwriting decisions, we continually review our auto-decision algorithms. Additionally, we provide access to alternative financing options to a wider range of consumers through our relationship with third-party payment solution providers such as Synchrony Bank (“Synchrony”) and Progressive Leasing (“Progressive”). These third parties manage their own respective underwriting decisions and are responsible for their own collections. Our in-house credit programs and access to third-party payment solutions allows us to provide credit to a large and under-served customer base and differentiates us from our competitors that do not offer similar programs.
Our goal is to provide every customer that enters our stores or applies for credit on our website an affordable monthly payment option. Currently, we make the following payment options available to our customers based on a review of their credit worthiness:

• | For customers with credit scores that are typically above 650, we offer special no-interest or lower interest option financing programs on select products through a Conn’s branded revolving credit card from Synchrony or we may offer an in-house financing program;


• | For customers with credit scores that are typically between 550 and 650, we offer our proprietary in-house financing program, which is a fixed term, fixed payment installment and consumer loan contract; and


• | For customers that do not qualify for our credit programs, we offer a lease-to-own payment option through an arrangement with our third-party lease-to-own provider.

We continuously evaluate alternative financing programs that may give us the ability to provide more customers with the ability to purchase the products and services we offer.
Our retail business and credit business operate independently from each other. The retail segment is not involved in credit approval decisions or collections. Decisions to extend consumer credit to our retail customers under our in-house programs are made by our internal credit underwriting department. In addition to underwriting, we manage the collection process of our in-house consumer credit portfolio. Sales financed through our in-house credit programs are secured by the products purchased, which we believe gives us a distinct advantage over other creditors when pursuing collections. Also, the products we sell and finance are typically necessities for the home. 
We mitigate credit risk by originating to a substantial number of customers who have purchased from us in the past. These repeat customers have historically exhibited a lower probability of default than new customers.  For fiscal year 2019 and 2018, 55% and 53%, respectively, of our originations were to repeat customers who financed a purchase through our in-house credit programs more than five months after financing an initial purchase through our in-house credit programs.  As of January 31, 2019 and 2018, 62% and 61%, respectively, of balances due under our in-house credit programs were from repeat customers who have previously financed with us.

Industry and Market Overview
The products we sell are typically considered home necessities, used by our customers in their everyday lives. Many factors influence sales, including consumer confidence, economic conditions, and household formations. We also benefit from the introduction of new products and technologies driving consumers to upgrade existing appliances, electronics and home office products. 
As of January 31, 2019, we operated 57 of our 123 stores in Texas. As a result, we continue to benefit from strong demographic trends in the state of Texas. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (the “Bureau of Economic Analysis”), Texas was the second largest state by nominal GDP in 2018. In addition, from calendar year 2013 to 2018, Texas experienced population growth of 8.4% compared to the United States (“U.S.”) population growth of 3.5% over the same period. Moreover, the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.8% as of January 2019.
Furniture and Mattress.  According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal consumption expenditures for household furniture and mattresses were $114.8 billion for calendar year 2018, an increase of 4.6% from $109.7 billion in 2017. The household furniture and mattress market is highly fragmented with sales coming from manufacturer-owned stores, independent dealers, furniture centers, specialty sleep product stores, national and local chains, mass market retailers, department stores, the internet, and, to a lesser extent, home improvement centers, decorator showrooms, wholesale clubs and catalog retailers. For fiscal year 2019, we generated 35.5% of total product sales from the sale of furniture and mattresses. The furniture and mattress category generated our highest individual product category gross margin. Given our ability to provide customer financing and next day delivery, we believe that we have strong competitive advantages and significant growth opportunities in this market and expect to continue to grow the balance of sale of our furniture and mattress product category. Product design, innovation and technological advancements have been key drivers of sales in this market.
Home Appliance. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, personal consumption expenditures for home appliances were $58.0 billion for calendar year 2018, an increase of 3.6% from $56.0 billion in 2017. Major household appliances, such as refrigerators and washer/dryers, accounted for 84.3% of this total at $48.9 billion in 2018. For fiscal year 2019, we generated 30.8% of total product sales from the sale of home appliances. The retail appliance market is large and concentrated among a few major dealers, with sales coming primarily from home improvement centers, large appliance and electronics superstores, national chains, warehouse clubs, department stores, regional chains, local dealers/single-store operators, manufacturer-direct websites and internet retailers. 
Key drivers of sales in the appliance market include product design and innovation, brand and quality. We carry products with features that include large-capacity, high-efficiency laundry appliances, refrigerator design innovation, technological advancements such as smart home connectivity and variations on these features from leading brands. 
Consumer Electronics and Home Office. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, electronics spending was $233.7 billion for calendar year 2018, an increase of 4.8% from $223.1 billion for calendar year 2017. Televisions accounted for $32.0 billion of the overall personal consumption expenditures, versus $30.9 billion in the prior year. Personal computers and peripheral equipment accounted for $62.9 billion of the overall expenditures, compared to $59.3 billion in the prior year. For fiscal year 2019, we generated 24.3% of total product sales from the sale of consumer electronics and 8.0% of total product sales from the sale of home office products. The electronics market is highly fragmented with sales coming from large appliance and electronics superstores, national chains, warehouse clubs, regional chains, local dealers/single-store operators, manufacturer-direct websites, consumer electronics departments of selected department and discount stores and internet retailers.
Technological advancements and the introduction of new products largely drive demand in the electronics market. Historically, industry growth has been fueled primarily by the introduction of products that incorporate new technologies, including LED, QLED, OLED, 4K Ultra HD, smart televisions, gaming products, home theater and touch-screen computers. New technologies offer better clarity and quality of video, increased computer processing speed, availability of additional 4K content and other significant advantages, which have driven increases in large screen and premium television sales. 
Consumer Credit.  Based on data from the Federal Reserve System, estimated total consumer credit outstanding, which primarily excludes loans secured by real estate, was $4.0 trillion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of 5.3% from $3.8 trillion at December 31, 2017. Consumers obtain credit from banks, credit unions, finance companies and non-financial businesses that offer credit, including retailers. The credit obtained takes many forms, including revolving (e.g., credit cards) and fixed-term (e.g., automobile loans), and at times is secured by the products being purchased. 
Competition. Our competitive strength is based on offering financing options, including our proprietary in-house credit programs, to our core credit-constrained customers, enhanced customer service and customer shopping experience through our unique sales force training and product knowledge, next day delivery capabilities, low payment guarantee and product repair service. Currently, we compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national mass merchants such as Wal-Mart, Target, Sam’s Club, Sears and Costco, specialized national retailers such as Best Buy, Ashley Furniture, and Mattress Firm, home improvement stores such as Lowe’s and Home Depot, and locally-owned regional or independent retail specialty stores that sell furniture and mattresses, 
5

home appliances, and consumer electronics similar, and often identical, to those items we sell. We also compete with internet retailers such as Amazon, Wayfair and manufacturer-direct websites. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. However, these competitors typically do not provide a credit offering similar to our proprietary in-house credit programs for credit-constrained consumers. We also compete against companies offering credit-constrained consumers products for the home similar to those offered by us under weekly or monthly lease-to-own payment options. Competitors include Aaron’s and Rent-A-Center, as well as many smaller, independent companies.
Customers
We have a well-defined core consumer base that is comprised of working individuals who typically earn between $25,000 to $60,000 in annual income, live in densely populated and mature neighborhoods, and typically shop at our stores to replace older household goods with newer items. Our product line is comprised of durable home necessities which enables us to appeal to a diverse range of cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and to operate stores in diverse markets. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of our total revenues and we do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer. Therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our business. 
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter due primarily to the holiday selling season. In addition, during the first quarter, our portfolio performance benefits from the timing of personal income tax refunds received by our customers, which typically results in higher cash collection rates.
Merchandising
Vendors. We purchase products from a wide range of manufacturers and distributors. Our agreements with these manufacturers and distributors typically cover a one-year time period and are renewable at the option of the parties. Similar to other specialty retailers, we purchase a significant portion of our total inventory from a limited number of vendors. During fiscal year 2019, 65.3% of our total inventory purchases were from six vendors, including 25.3%, 16.1% and 7.0% of our total inventory purchases from Samsung, LG, and New Age, respectively. The loss of any one or more of these key vendors or our failure to establish and maintain relationships with these and other vendors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Other than industry-wide shortages that occur from time to time, we have not experienced significant difficulty in maintaining adequate sources of merchandise and we generally expect that adequate sources of merchandise will continue to exist for the types of products we sell. 
Merchandise. We focus on providing a selection of quality merchandise at a wide range of price points to appeal to a broad range of potential customers. We primarily sell brand name merchandise with manufacturer’s warranties. Our established relationships with furniture and mattress, home appliance and consumer electronics vendors give us purchasing power that allows us to offer name brand appliances and electronics at prices that are comparable with national retailers and provides us a competitive selling advantage over smaller independent retailers. We are able to purchase furniture inventory in volumes that allow us to import container load quantities that reduce our costs and allow us to offer our products at competitive prices. Additionally, we provide next-day delivery to a majority of our customers, giving us a competitive advantage over smaller furniture retailers in the marketplace today. 
Credit Operations
General. We sell our products by offering our customers financing through our proprietary in-house credit programs, the use of third-party financing, and by taking cash or credit card payments. For the fiscal year 2019, approximately 70.1% of purchases were financed through our proprietary in-house credit programs, approximately 23.2% of purchases were financed through the use of third-party financing, and approximately 6.7% of purchases were made with cash or credit card. 
Underwriting. Decisions to extend credit to our retail customers are made by our internal credit underwriting department, which is separate and distinct from our other operations, including credit monitoring and collections and retail sales. In addition to auto-decision algorithms, we employ a team of credit underwriting personnel of approximately 60 individuals to make credit granting decisions using our proprietary underwriting process. Our underwriting process considers one or more of the following elements: credit bureau information; income and address verification; current income and debt levels; a review of the customer’s previous credit history with us; and the particular products being purchased. Our underwriting models determine the finance terms, including down payment, limit amounts and credit terms. During fiscal year 2019, for the credit applications that were approved and utilized, 62.7% were approved automatically. The remaining credit decisions were based on the evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness by a qualified in-house credit underwriter or required additional documentation from the applicant. For certain credit applicants that may have past credit problems or lack credit history, we use stricter underwriting criteria. The additional requirements include verification of employment and recent work history, reference checks and minimum down payment levels. Our underwriting employees are trained to follow our methodology in approving credit.

Part of our ability to control delinquency and net charge-off is based on the total approval amount, the level of down payment that we require, the maximum contract terms we allow and the purchase money security interest that we obtain in the product financed, which reduce our credit risk and increase our customers’ ability and willingness to meet their future obligations. We require the customer to provide proof of property insurance coverage on all purchases financed through our credit offerings to offset potential losses relating to theft or damage of the product financed. We do not require customers to purchase property insurance from us if they have or acquire such insurance from another third-party.  
Credit monitoring and collections. Our collection activities involve a combination of efforts that take place primarily in our Beaumont and San Antonio, Texas, collection centers. As of January 31, 2019, we employed approximately 480 full and part time individual collectors and support personnel who service our active customer credit portfolio. We also utilize collection agencies to service portions of our active and charged-off portfolio, which provide approximately 230 additional agents. Our in-house, credit-financed sales are secured by the products purchased, which we believe gives us a distinct advantage over other creditors when pursuing collections, especially given that many of the products we finance are generally necessities for the home. We utilize a credit collection strategy that includes telephone calls and messages, inside collectors that contact borrowers, collection letters, e-mails, text messages and third-party legal services that process claims and attend bankruptcy hearings and voluntary repossession. Our employees are trained to follow our methodology in collecting our accounts and charging off any uncollectible accounts based on pre-determined aging criteria, depending on their area of responsibility. All collection personnel are required to complete classroom training, which includes negotiation techniques and credit policy training to ensure customer retention and compliance with debt collection regulations. Post-graduation, the collection trainees undergo skill assessment training, coaching and call monitoring within their respective departments. Our personnel are required to complete regular refresher training and testing. 
We closely monitor the credit portfolio to identify delinquent accounts early and dedicate resources to contact customers concerning past due accounts. We believe that our unique underwriting models, secured interest in the products financed, required down payments and credit limits, local presence, ability to work with customers relative to their product and service needs, and our flexible financing alternatives help mitigate the loss experience on our portfolio. 
Customers can make payments through our web portal, over the phone, by ACH, third-party bill pay arrangements, by mail to our lock box or in-person at our store locations. During fiscal year 2019, we received 28.0% of the payments on credit accounts in our store locations, which helps us maintain a relationship with the customer that keeps losses lower while encouraging repeat purchases. We regularly extend or “re-age” a portion of our delinquent customer accounts as a part of our normal collection procedures to protect our investment. Generally, extensions are granted to customers who have experienced a financial difficulty (such as the temporary loss of employment), which is subsequently resolved and when the customer indicates a willingness and ability to resume making monthly payments. These re-ages involve modifying the payment terms to defer a portion of the cash payments currently required of the debtor to help the debtor improve his or her financial condition and eventually be able to pay the account balance. Our re-aging of customer accounts does not change the interest rate or the total principal amount due from the customer and typically does not reduce the monthly contractual payments. We typically charge the customer an extension fee, which approximates the interest owed for the time period the contract was past due. Our re-age programs consist of extensions and two payment updates, which include unilateral extensions to customers who make two full payments in three calendar months in certain states. Re-ages are not granted to debtors who demonstrate a lack of intent or ability to service the obligation or have reached our limits for account re-aging. To a much lesser extent, we may provide the customer the ability to re-age their obligation by refinancing the account, which does not change the interest rate or the total principal amount due from the customer but does reduce the monthly contractual payments and extends the term. Under these options the customer must demonstrate a willingness and ability to resume making contractual monthly payments.
We deem an account to be uncollectible and charge it off when the account is more than 209 days past due at the end of a month. Our credit and accounting staff consistently monitor trends in charge-offs by examining the various characteristics of the charge-offs, including by market, product type, customer credit and income information, down payment amounts and other identifying information. We track our charge-offs both gross, before recoveries, and net, after recoveries. We periodically adjust our credit granting, collection and charge-off policies based on this information. It is to our advantage to manage the portfolio to balance the combined servicing costs and net losses on the credit portfolio with the benefit of repeat retail sales. We may incur higher servicing costs in order to build customer relationships that may result in future retail sales. Collection activity continues after an account is charged off by both internal staff and third party collection agencies who are typically paid on a contingency basis.

Store Operations
Stores. We operate retail stores in 14 states. The following table summarizes the number of stores in operation at January 31, 2019 in each of our markets:

Geographic Location | Number of Locations | Retail Square Feet | | OtherSquare Feet
Alabama | 1 | | 39,124 | | 7,204 
Arizona | 11 | | 384,283 | | 73,936

Texas | 57 | | 2,009,158 | | 321,489 
Virginia | 5 | | 171,968 | | 38,771 
Store totals | 123 | | 4,425,544 | | 816,218 
Distribution and Service Centers and Cross-dock Facilities (excluding cross-docks within stores) | 21 | | — | | 2,958,617
Corporate Offices | 4 | | — | | 196,984 
Total | 148 | | 4,425,544 | | 3,971,819

Our stores have an average selling space of approximately 36,000 square feet, plus a storage area for fast-moving and smaller products that customers prefer to carry out rather than wait for in-home delivery. Thirteen of our retail stores also contain cross-dock facilities.
We continuously evaluate our existing and potential sites to position our stores in desirable locations and relocate stores that are not properly positioned. We typically lease rather than purchase our stores, distribution and service centers and cross-dock facilities to retain the flexibility of managing our financial commitment to a location if we later decide that a store or market is performing below our standards or the market would be better served by a relocation. As of January 31, 2019, we leased almost all of our store, distribution and service center and cross-dock locations. 
Personnel and compensation. We staff a typical store with a store manager, an assistant manager, an operations manager, an average of 20 sales personnel and other support staff, including cashiers and porters based on store size and location. Managers have an average tenure with us of approximately four years and typically have prior sales floor experience. In addition to store managers, we have 17 district managers.
We compensate the majority of our sales associates on a straight commission arrangement. Store managers and assistant store managers receive a salary and are eligible for a bonus. We believe that because our store compensation plans are primarily tied to sales, they generally provide us an advantage in attracting and retaining highly motivated employees.
Advertising
We design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brand, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop in our stores and on our website and increase sales. We employ a multi-touch point approach utilizing direct mail, television, newspaper, digital, radio and out-of-home targeted advertising. Our promotional programs include the use of free delivery and free product promotions, in conjunction with product discounts and various no-interest option financing offers. 
8

E-Commerce
We are focused on expanding the capabilities of our website to generate customer traffic for both our digital and physical stores. Our website provides new and existing customers with the ability to review substantially all of our product offerings and prices, apply for credit and make payments on their credit accounts. We update our website regularly to reflect new products, product availability and current promotional offers. Customers may also purchase certain products on our website using a credit card. Our website is a significant component of our advertising strategy. We believe our website represents a possible source for future sales and growth in our credit collections. We are focused on improving the customer experience by making it easier for customers to apply for and be approved for credit on-line. In late fiscal year 2019, we started to offer certain credit-qualified customers the ability to complete an entire purchase transaction financed online through our proprietary in-house credit programs. Our website averaged approximately 59,000 credit applications per month during fiscal year 2019. This compares to average monthly website applications of approximately 57,000 and 53,000 during fiscal year 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
The website is supported by a call center, allowing us to better assist customers with their credit and product needs.
Distribution and Inventory Management
We currently operate 10 regional distribution centers, which are located in Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Beaumont, El Paso, and McAllen, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; Charlotte, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee, one service center located in Houston, Texas, 10 smaller cross-dock facilities and 13 stores with cross-dock facilities. This enables us to deliver products to our customers quickly, reduces inventory requirements at the individual stores and facilitates regional inventory and accounting controls.
In our retail stores, we maintain an inventory of certain fast-moving items and products that the customer is likely to carry out of the store. Our computer system and the use of scanning technology in our distribution centers allow us to determine, on a real-time basis, the location of any product we sell. If we do not have a product at the desired retail store at the time of sale, we can typically provide it through one of our distribution centers on a next day basis.
We primarily use third-party providers to move products from distribution centers to stores and between markets to meet customer needs. We outsource our in-home deliveries to third-party providers and, for most purchases, we offer next day delivery to our customers. These third-party providers use a fleet of home delivery vehicles that enables a highly trained staff of delivery and installation specialists to quickly complete the sales process and provide a high-quality customer experience. We also may receive a delivery fee based on the products sold and the services needed to complete the delivery.
Product Support Services
Next-day delivery and installation. We provide next-day delivery and installation services in most of the markets in which we operate. We believe next-day delivery of our goods is a highly valued service to our customers.
Credit insurance. Acting as licensed agents for third-party insurance companies, we offer property, life, disability and involuntary unemployment credit insurance, which we collectively refer to as credit insurance, at all of our stores on sales financed through our in-house credit programs. These insurance products protect the customer’s purchase by covering their payments on their credit account if covered events occur. Property insurance purchased through us can be canceled at any time with proof of alternative coverage. We receive sales commissions from the third-party insurance companies at the time we sell the coverage, and we may receive retrospective commissions, which are additional commissions paid by the insurance carrier if insurance claims are less than earned premiums. 
We require proof of property insurance on all purchases financed through our in-house credit offerings; however, we do not require that customers purchase this insurance from us if they have or acquire such insurance from another third-party provider. Premiums charged on the credit products we sell are regulated and vary by state.
Product repair service. We believe that providing product repair and replacement services is an important differentiation and reinforces customer loyalty. We provide in-home and shop repair services for most of the products we sell and primarily service products purchased from us. Customer repair needs are primarily serviced with an employee-based technician workforce. We believe this staffing model allows us to control the post-sale customer service experience. 
Repair service agreements. Customers may purchase repair service agreements that we sell for third-party insurers at the time a product is purchased. These agreements broaden and extend the period of covered manufacturer warranty service for up to four years from the date of purchase, depending on the product, and protect the customer against repair costs. Customers may finance the cost of the agreements along with the purchase price of the associated product. 
We have contracts with third-party insurers that issue the initial repair service agreements to cover the costs of repairs performed under these agreements. The initial service agreement is between the customer and the third-party insurance company, and, through our agreements with the third-party insurance company, we provide service when it is needed under each agreement sold. We receive a commission on the sale of the contract and we may receive retrospective commissions, which are additional commissions 
9

paid by the insurance carrier over time if the cost of repair claims are less than earned premiums. Additionally, we bill the insurance company for the cost of the service work that we perform. 
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 4,300 full-time employees and 175 part-time employees. We offer a comprehensive benefits package for eligible employees, including health, life, short- and long-term disability, and dental insurance coverage as well as a 401(k) plan, employee stock purchase plan, paid vacation and holiday pay. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us, and we believe that our employee relations are good. We have a formal dispute resolution plan that requires mandatory arbitration for employment-related issues.
Regulation
The extension of credit to consumers is a highly regulated area of our business. Numerous federal and state laws impose disclosure and other requirements and limitations on the origination, servicing and enforcement of retail installment sale accounts and consumer loans as well as our acts and practices in connection with these activities. Applicable federal laws include, but are not limited to, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLB”), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (“EFTA”) and the implementing regulations of the foregoing statutes. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has broad consumer protection enforcement authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (“FTCA”), which prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” The FTC also can enforce specific consumer protection statutes, such as the ECOA, FCRA, and TILA, and issue regulations in respect thereof. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) was created in 2010 upon the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The CFPB has rulemaking and enforcement authority over nonbanks engaging in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service (such as extending credit and servicing loans) as well as any affiliate of such “covered person” that acts as a “service provider” to such covered person. The federal consumer financial laws over which the CFPB has enforcement and rulemaking authority include TILA, ECOA, FCRA, FDCPA, and GLB as well as authority under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” (“UDAAP”) in connection with consumer financial products and services. The scope of UDAAP is broad and often uncertain, but the CFPB has been active in enforcing UDAAP claims. The CFPB has broad power to impose civil money penalties, restitution, and other corrective action under the various laws described above and, for this reason, poses a significant regulatory risk to the origination, servicing, and collection of our retail installment contracts and consumer loans. 
In addition to its rulemaking and enforcement authority described in the preceding paragraph, the CFPB also has supervisory and examination authority over mortgage lending, payday lending, and private student lending, as well as “larger participants” in other markets for consumer financial products or services (including debt collection), and any covered person if the CFPB has “reasonable cause to determine” that such covered person is engaging, or has engaged, in conduct that poses risks to consumers with regard to the offering or provision of consumer financial products or services, whether based on consumer complaints or “information from other sources.” Although we are not automatically subject to CFPB supervisory or examination authority based on the foregoing categories, the CFPB has authority to investigate and take enforcement action against us with respect to any alleged violation by us of a federal consumer financial law over which the CFPB has jurisdiction, including the prohibition on UDAAP. The mere receipt by us of a “civil investigative demand” from the CFPB requiring production of documents, written responses, reports or oral testimony could result in required public disclosure, adverse publicity, and substantial cost to us regardless of the outcome. 
Regulatory rulemaking by the CFPB could adversely affect origination, servicing, and collection of our retail installment sale and consumer loan products by making it more difficult and costly for us to offer, service or collect these products. In addition, CFPB rulemaking could make it possible, or easier for our customers to bring class action claims against us, or prohibit or limit the use of arbitration clauses and class action waivers, both of which we include in our installment contracts and loan agreements. 
Prior to August 2016, our proprietary financing product consisted of a retail installment sale contract entered into between Conn Appliances, Inc. and our customer. Commencing in August 2016, the Conn Appliances, Inc. retail installment sale contract offer for Texas store customers was phased out, and Conn Credit Corporation, Inc., an affiliate of Conn Appliances, Inc., began offering a consumer loan product to our customers. Similar to the procedure employed with retail installment sale contracts, the loan contracts are assigned to an affiliate. In conjunction with this Texas direct loan program, Texas consumer lender licenses were obtained by Conn Credit Corporation, Inc., Conn Appliances, Inc., and the affiliate entity Conn Credit I, LP holding the loan contracts. We completed similar transitions from our retail installment sales contracts to consumer loan products in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Tennessee. For customers of most stores located outside of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Tennessee, Conn Appliances, Inc. continues to offer a retail installment sale contract. We are reviewing opportunities in other states where we may be able to make a similar transition to consumer loan products. 
State laws impose disclosure and other requirements and limitations on retail installment sale contracts and consumer loan agreements and impose maximum amounts of finance charges and interest, as well as regulation of other fees and charges, together 
10

with restrictions on credit terms, collection and enforcement and other aspects of extending and collecting consumer credit. State consumer finance laws vary from state to state. The originating and servicing of consumer loans typically requires state licensing which entails heightened supervision, examination, and other requirements which may not be applicable to retail sellers extending credit under retail installment sale contracts. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, state attorneys general and designated state consumer finance regulatory agencies may enforce specified federal consumer finance laws and impose penalties and remedies for their violation. We routinely review our contracts and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable consumer credit laws. Failure on our part to comply with applicable laws could expose us to consumer litigation and government enforcement action, possibly resulting in substantial penalties and claims for damages and, in certain circumstances, may subject us to injunctions, require us to refund finance charges already paid, forgo finance charges not yet paid under credit accounts, change our credit extension, servicing, collection, and marketing practices or a combination of the foregoing. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal and state consumer credit and collection laws.
The sale of credit insurance products by us and insured by an unaffiliated insurance provider include property, life, disability and involuntary unemployment credit insurance products is also highly regulated. These products are only offered with a retail installment sales or loan contract agreement purchase. State laws currently impose disclosure obligations and other restrictions with respect to our sales of these products, impose limitations on the amount of premiums that we may charge and require licensing of certain of our employees and operating entities. State laws with respect to these products vary from state to state. Failure to comply with these laws could expose us to consumer litigation and government enforcement action, possibly resulting in substantial penalties and claims for damages, and in certain circumstances, may subject us to injunctions or require us to refund premiums or change our policies and procedures with respect to these products and the marketing of these products or a combination of the foregoing. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our credit insurance business.
In conjunction with the sale of merchandise, we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase repair service agreements on specified products. These contracts are entered into between the customer and an unaffiliated service provider. The contracts enable the customer to obtain repair and/or replacement of certain eligible products in the event of specified failures as described in the terms and conditions of the contract. The service provider, which is financially and legally obligated to perform under these contracts, has entered into a contract with our affiliate to administer the contracts. We post descriptions of these contracts and links to the contract terms on our website. Service contracts require payment of a segregated fee which may be purchased by cash, check or financed by customers entering into retail installment sale contracts with Conn Appliances, Inc. or loan agreements with Conn Credit Corporation, Inc. The federal Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act governs written warranties and service contracts. For service contracts entered into with Texas customers, state law requires registration of the service provider and Conn Appliances, Inc. as an administrator, a reimbursement insurance policy and other requirements on the service provider, responsibilities on service contract sellers, record-keeping requirements, restrictions on the sale or marketing of service contracts, required contract terms and disclosures, and cancellation requirements, among other requirements and prohibitions. Other states vary in their regulation of these contracts. Violation of these laws can result in injunctive relief, civil penalties, and/or other remedies. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the offering and administration of service contracts.
