The Company
 
We are an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. We target indications with high unmet needs and large market opportunities with non-opioid therapies for the treatment of patients with acute and chronic pain and are dedicated to advancing and improving patient outcomes. We launched our first commercial product in October 2018 and are developing our late-stage pipeline, which includes a pivotal Phase 3 candidate, a Phase 2 candidate, and a Phase 1 candidate that is expected to enter Phase 2 studies in 2023. Our commercial product, ZTlidoÒ (lidocaine topical system) 1.8% is a prescription lidocaine topical product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the relief of neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia (“PHN”), which is a form of post-shingles nerve pain. ZTlido possesses novel delivery and adhesion technology designed to address many of the limitations of current prescription lidocaine patches by providing significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. We license the rights to ZTlido from and rely exclusively on Oishi Koseido Co., Ltd. (“Oishi”) and Itochu Chemical Frontier Corporation (“Itochu,” and together with Oishi, the “Developers”) pursuant to the Product Development Agreement and Commercial Supply Agreement. We have acquired two FDA approved non-opioid pain products for the treatment of gout in adults and oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults, which we plan to commercialize in the U.S. in 2023.

Our three product candidates are (i) SP-102 (10 mg, dexamethasone sodium phosphate viscous gel) (“SEMDEXAÔ”), a Phase 3, novel, viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid for epidural injections to treat lumbosacral radicular pain, or sciatica; (ii) SP-103 (lidocaine topical system) 5.4%, (“SP-103”), a Phase 2, next-generation, triple-strength formulation of ZTlido, for the treatment of low back pain (“LBP”); and (iii) SP-104 (4.5 mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules) (“SP-104”), a novel low-dose delayed-release naltrexone hydrochloride being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia, for which Phase 1 trials were completed in the second quarter of 2022 and a Phase 2 clinical trial is expected to commence in 2023. If these product candidates are approved by the FDA, we believe each of them could become the treatment option for their respective indications in the United States.

On June 14, 2022, we entered into a License and Commercialization Agreement (the “Romeg Agreement”) with RxOmeg Therapeutics, LLC (a/k/a Romeg Therapeutics, Inc.) (“Romeg”). Pursuant to the Romeg Agreement, among other things, Romeg granted us (1) the right to manufacture, promote, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products comprising liquid formulations of colchicine for the prophylactic treatment of gout in adult humans in the United States, and (2) an exclusive, transferable license to use the trademark “GLOPERBAÒ”. GLOPERBA is an FDA-approved, oral medication for the treatment of gout in adults. Gout is a painful arthritic disorder affecting an estimated 8.7 million people in the United States. Gout pain can be excruciating and is a form of inflammatory arthritis that develops in some people who have high levels of uric acid in their blood. It can cause sudden severe episodes of pain and can be disabling with tenderness, warmth and swelling. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine and corticosteroids are used a majority of time as the first line to treat acute gout. The U.S. is observed to have a high prevalence of gout, owing to lifestyle issues such as high alcohol intake, obesity, and smoking. We are planning to commercialize GLOPERBA in 2023 and believe we are well-positioned to market and distribute the product. We have a direct distribution network to national and regional wholesalers and pharmacies throughout the U.S. For more information on Scilex, please see the section titled “Business — Material Agreements — Romeg License and Commercialization Agreement.” On February 12, 2023, we acquired from BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.

and Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. the rights to certain patents, trademarks, regulatory approvals, data, contracts, and other rights related to ELYXYBTM (celecoxib oral solution) and the commercialization thereof in the United States and Canada. ELYXYBTM is a first-line treatment and the only FDA-approved, ready-to-use oral solution for the acute treatment of migraine, with or without aura, in adults. We are planning to commercialize ELYXYBTM in the U.S. in 2023.

We are focused on identifying treatment options for pain management with established mechanisms that have deficiencies in safety, efficacy or patient experience. We believe this approach allows us to potentially leverage the regulatory approval pathway available under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for each of these pipeline product candidates.

We believe our marketed product, ZTlido, has multiple advantages over currently available prescription and over-the-counter (“OTC”) lidocaine patches, of which over 147 million and 136 million of such patches were sold in the United States in 2021 and 2020, respectively, according to Symphony Healthcare. We have sold 6,336,032 and 7,011,112 ZTlido patches in the United States in 2020 and 2021, respectively. We acquired SP-102 from Semnur Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Semnur”) in March 2019 and are developing SP-102 to be an injectable viscous gel formulation of a widely used corticosteroid designed to address the serious risks posed by off-label epidural steroid injections (“ESI”), which are administered over 12 million times annually in the United States. See the section titled “Business — Material Agreements — Semnur Merger Agreement” for a description of our acquisition of Semnur and our ongoing obligations to Semnur’s former equityholders. SEMDEXA has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the only FDA-approved ESI for the treatment of sciatica. According to a report by Decision Resources Group, it was estimated that over 4.8 million patients would suffer from sciatica in the United States in 2022. SP-103 has also been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the first FDA-approved lidocaine topical product for the treatment of acute LBP. We are developing SP-104 as a novel delayed-release formulation of low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride for the treatment of fibromyalgia, which remains a largely unmet medical need given the low response rates of commercially available therapies. Naltrexone is routinely used off-label to treat fibromyalgia. There are no low-dose formulations commercially available in the United States. Our patented formulation is designed to overcome undesirable effects of immediate release naltrexone, such as hyperalgesia, dysphoria, nausea, anxiety and insomnia. We believe our currently approved product and future product candidates, if approved, could uniquely address what we believe are the significant unmet needs of the targeted populations.


Our Marketed Product and Pipeline
 
The following chart illustrates our current commercial product and novel product candidates, for which we have worldwide commercialization rights, except with respect to Japan for ZTlido and SP-103.
Our Strategy
 
Our vision is to become the leading pain management company delivering novel non-opioid and non-addictive treatments to provide safe, effective and durable relief of multiple pain conditions. To accomplish this, the principal elements of our strategy are the following:
 •Maximize the commercial potential of ZTlido. We have assembled an integrated commercial organization using a dedicated sales force and sales management, marketing and managed care capabilities to support continued uptake of ZTlido. We leverage a sales force of approximately 60-70 people, targeting over 10,000 primary care physicians, pain specialists, neurologists, and palliative care physicians who we believe treat the majority of PHN patients. Additionally, we are utilizing direct-to-patient marketing strategies to expand awareness and utilization of ZTlido. Our managed healthcare account executives have extensive experience in negotiating contracts and have already achieved significant uptake by adding ZTlido to key formularies such as CVS Caremark/Aetna Commercial, Cigna HealthCare (commercial and Medicare plans), Express Scripts (commercial and most Medicare plans), United Healthcare Commercial, Optum Rx Select Commercial, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield (“BCBS”), BCBS Louisiana and Kansas, Lifetime/Excellus BCBS, MedImpact, CareFirst, Elixir Commercial and Medicaid in California, Florida, Idaho, and North Dakota.
 •Commercialize and successfully re-launch GLOPERBA® for gout in the U.S.: We will utilize our current commercial infrastructure comprised of our sales, marketing, and managed health care functions to promote GLOPERBA® for gout to approximately 3,000 healthcare providers (“HCPs”) in the U.S. market. We anticipate a good degree of overlap between the current HCPs 
 
that we target and HCPs who prescribe colchicine for gout, allowing for efficient dual promotion of Gloperba and ZTlido. The principal elements of the GLOPERBA strategy are as follows:
 oEducate the market on the need for and value of simplified and precise colchicine dose adjustments to allow individualized, patient-by-patient therapy. Scilex will leverage its in-person sales forces, medical affairs teams, and omni-channel HCP engagement campaigns to drive awareness of GLOPERBA’s features and benefits. In addition, target providers, rheumatologists and primary care physicians treating various comorbidities, will be provided with tools to help them identify and prescribe GLOPERBA to appropriate patients.
 oIncrease access to GLOPERBA for subsets of patients in prophylactic treatment of gout, specifically those with comorbidities and GI intolerance. Our managed healthcare account executives will negotiate contracts with key payer and pharmacy customers to achieve uptake of key formularies.
 •Develop and commercialize SEMDEXA as a novel epidural injection for the first approved treatment of sciatica. We are developing SEMDEXA to address the limitations associated with the available corticosteroid epidural injectable products that are used off-label. Many of these products contain potentially neurotoxic preservatives and particulates, and are administered over 12 million times annually despite a warning on the label of serious neurologic complications, including loss of vision, stroke, paralysis and death. These products carry warnings required by the FDA that the safety and efficacy of epidural administration has not been established. SEMDEXA has received fast track designation from the FDA and, if approved, could become the first FDA-approved epidural steroid product with long-term patent protection, which we also believe would create significant barriers to entry. Due to the novelty of our formulation as well as the associated patents and trade secrets, future potential competitors could be required to conduct extensive preclinical studies and costly comparative clinical trials. A full 6-month data analysis was completed in February 2022 and we have recently completed a pivotal Phase 3 study with final results received in March 2022, which results reflect achievement of primary and secondary endpoints. We believe these final results are supportive of a breakthrough therapy designation for sciatica that, in addition to the fast track designation, is expected to allow the FDA to further expedite the overall development program leading to market approval. We have extensive clinical and pre-clinical data (including those obtained from multiple Phase 2 clinical trials) with the novel viscous gel formulation of SP-102. We expect to present the robust data collected over the course of our multi-year clinical development program to the FDA as part of a New Drug Application (“NDA”). We also presented the pivotal Phase 3 trial results at the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians annual meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada in May 2022.
 •Pursue clinical development of SP-103 for the first approved topical treatment in patients with acute LBP. We are developing SP-103 as a triple-strength lidocaine topical system for the treatment of acute LBP, to be used where we believe a high-dose strength and superior adhesive qualities of a topical system may provide a greater therapeutic benefit than currently available therapies. SP-103 is designed to use ZTlido’s delivery and adhesion technology to deliver a dose of lidocaine that is threefold higher than any other approved lidocaine topical products. We initiated a Phase 2 trial in acute LBP in the second quarter of 2022. SP-103 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the first FDA-approved lidocaine topical product for the treatment of acute LBP.
 
•Pursue clinical development of SP-104 for the treatment of fibromyalgia, which has very few approved therapies that are marginally effective and have unpleasant side-effects. We are developing SP-104 for fibromyalgia. Low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules are routinely used off-label to treat fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions such as complex regional pain. SP-104 addresses the shortcomings of using the high-dose commercial products and pharmacy-compounded products by delivering a low-dose of naltrexone hydrochloride (approximately 11 times less than the commercial product) in a delayed-release formulation that bypasses the stomach and releases the drug in the gut (upper intestine). These product characteristics mitigate against the known safety issues associated with the high-dose commercial products and immediate release pharmacy-compounded products, and the overall reliability issues associated with pharmacy-compounded products. SP-104 has completed two Phase 1 studies to characterize the pharmacokinetics and safety of the product, and we expect to commence Phase 2 studies in 2023.
 •Expand our product portfolio by developing or acquiring non-opioid assets that leverage our novel delivery and adhesion technologies or our existing commercial infrastructure. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to leverage our research and development experience to develop non-opioid therapeutics for pain management indications that are not adequately served with existing treatment options. We also seek to in-license or acquire non-opioid therapeutics that can both complement our existing product portfolio and benefit from our existing commercial infrastructure. In evaluating marketed and clinical-stage expansion opportunities, we intend to pursue therapeutics that address markets served by our established target physician audience and that can be commercialized by our existing sales force.
 •Leverage our management team’s experience to further develop and commercialize its current and future product portfolio. Our management team has held senior positions at leading biopharmaceutical companies, including Allergan, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (“Teva”), Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Cephalon, Inc., Roche AG, PDL BioPharma, Inc., Xenoport, Inc. and Chiron Corp. Our team has substantial experience in rapidly progressing new drugs to clinical proof of concept, completing successful pivotal registration programs and successfully commercializing products.
 
We believe that our innovative non-opioid product portfolio has the potential to provide effective pain management therapies that can have a transformative impact on patients’ lives.

Our Product Portfolio
 
ZTlido
 
Our marketed product, ZTlido, is a lidocaine topical system approved for the relief of neuropathic pain associated with PHN. ZTlido was strategically designed to address the limitations of current prescription lidocaine patches by providing significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. We launched ZTlido in October 2018 with an integrated commercial organization and we believe its differentiated therapeutic profile, combined with our competitive pricing strategy and our active direct marketing efforts have driven, and will continue to drive, accelerated sales growth and increased market uptake.
Prescription Lidocaine Patch Market Overview
 
Prescription lidocaine patches are approved by the FDA as a local anesthetic and are generally used as a first-line treatment for the relief of neuropathic pain associated with PHN. PHN is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome that results as a complication following an infection of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster symptoms resolve after a few weeks, but the pain caused by the nerve injury can persist for months to years surrounding the affected area. According to Evaluate Ltd., there were over 3.5 million people living with PHN conditions in the United States in 2021. Lidocaine patches have also been used in patients with other types of pain, such as diabetic neuropathy, osteoarthritis and pain associated with surgery, cancer or trauma, and often in patients with LBP.
 
In 2021, there were more than 147 million prescription lidocaine patches sold in the United States, according to Symphony Healthcare. Of this, five lidocaine patch manufacturers accounted for approximately 92% of the total prescriptions, according to Symphony Healthcare. We believe that the PHN market will continue to expand with the introduction of our lidocaine topical system, ZTlido, which is supported by our commercial organization, by prescribing trends away from opioid use, and by continued growth in the population of patients aged 45 years and older who are at greater risk of suffering from PHN. Unlike Lidoderm, the FDA has not determined that any other products are therapeutically equivalent to ZTlido, and accordingly, a prescription for ZTlido may not be able to be substituted by a generic product.
 
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations of Existing Treatments
 
Recommended first-line treatment for the relief of neuropathic pain associated with PHN includes topical lidocaine, gabapentinoids (which have been associated with the potential for abuse as well as numerous adverse events), antidepressants and a multi-modal approach. Topical lidocaine and gabapentinoids are preferred for combination therapies due to their low propensity for drug-to-drug interactions. For example, an eight-week combination use with pregabalin (Lyrica) has been proven to reduce pain in half for patients who had inadequate relief on monotherapy, despite titration of pregabalin to effect. This efficacy boost was achieved without tolerability issues or adding to side effects.
 
A survey analyzing treatment patterns for neuropathic pain associated with PHN found that recommended first-line therapeutics were used in only 29% of patients examined from 2010 to 2014, while the remaining patients were started on various off-label treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDS”) and opioids. These drugs can have adverse effects, especially on elderly patients, which represent the majority of PHN patients. For example, opioids carry a well-characterized risk of abuse and misuse and the potential for serious side effects, such as respiratory depression, constipation and others, including death. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 75% of the 100,306 drug overdose deaths during the 12-month period ending in April 2021 involved opioids. Similarly, tricyclic antidepressants, which can be effective in managing the neuropathic pain associated with PHN, can result in significant systemic side effects and cardiotoxicity, posing risks to the elderly and patients with heart disease, epilepsy or glaucoma. These side effects make topical lidocaine products an attractive first-line treatment option from a safety perspective.
 
The safety of lidocaine patches is well-supported in medical literature. Unlike transdermal medications that are designed to achieve systemic drug levels via absorption through the skin or mucosal membrane, leading to effects away from the application site, topical lidocaine has a local effect at the site of application. Because drug application is localized to the immediate area surrounding the patch, systemic absorption from a topical patch is low, reducing the risk of systemic side effects and lowering the potential for drug interactions relative to other systemic pharmacologic therapies. Due to the low systemic exposure and minimal systemic side effects reported in clinical trials, we believe a

topical lidocaine patch is well-suited for patients being treated with multiple medications or at a higher risk of side effects, including the elderly or those with chronic conditions. As a localized treatment, lidocaine patches have been used concomitantly with other medications in patients for whom monotherapy is inadequate. Furthermore, we believe medication administered topically rather than orally can improve patient compliance.
 
While lidocaine patches have certain advantages over the treatment alternatives discussed above, certain patches have limitations that may impact efficacy. For example, poor adhesion of the patch is a leading problem for topical lidocaine patches cited in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (“FAERS”). Because the drug is incorporated in the adhesive for these products, patches must maintain adhesion or risk compromising the ability to deliver their full drug dose. As a result, establishing strong adhesion is a key factor for patient compliance and satisfaction. In draft guidance issued in July 2021, the FDA recommended that developers of topical and transdermal delivery systems (“TDSs”) conduct studies to characterize the adhesion performance of the product with suggested data requirements. Likewise, the FDA issued a draft guidance in October 2018 outlining the adhesion data requirements for generic TDSs. This guidance, along with Scilex’s past experience with regulatory agencies, shows the FDA’s interest and the importance of adhesion performance of these products. There are also dermal safety requirements that force developers to carefully balance adhesion performance against dermal safety. ZTlido is the first TDS product approved by the FDA that was able to demonstrate the targeted adhesion performance with an overall benign dermal safety profile.
 
The following figure depicts data derived from FAERS as of December 31, 2021:
 


For many of the competing lidocaine patches, a common drawback is the usage of hydrogel technology that limits the overall pharmaceutical efficiency of the product, requiring more total drug to be loaded into the patch to deliver sufficient drug to achieve a therapeutic effect. For example, Lidoderm has a drug load of 700 mg drug but only delivers 3± 2% of that drug load. Consequently, adhesive thickness must be increased in order to have a drug load sufficient to deliver a therapeutic dose of drug to the skin. As adhesive thickness increases, the product’s pliability can be compromised to the extent that the patch loses adhesion as the skin moves and wrinkles through normal patient activity. The weight of the hydrogel patches (largely due to high water content) further contributes to the challenge in maintaining adhesion.
 

The greater drug load also poses a risk of accidental exposure. For example, with a bioavailability of 3 ± 2% of the 700 mg drug load for Lidoderm, there is over 650 mg of drug remaining on the patch at the end of the 12-hour administration period, as captured in a bolded warning on the product label. If improperly disposed of, the residual drug poses the potential risk to children, pets and others of accidental exposure to a toxic amount of lidocaine, although we believe the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated.
 
In addition to prescription lidocaine patches, there are commercially-available OTC topical lidocaine products in the market, but none of these OTC products have been reviewed or approved by the FDA. Notably in 2003, the FDA proposed amending the tentative final monograph for OTC external analgesic drug products to clarify the status of patches (and poultices and plasters), noting that the dosage forms had not been determined to be generally recognized as safe and effective for any analgesia at that time. Therefore, the FDA would likely not consider these OTC products to be compliant with the monograph and do not have legal marketing status.
 
Our Solution
 
Our novel adhesion and delivery technology provides significantly improved adhesion compared to Lidoderm, manufactured by Endo Pharmaceuticals, and generic alternatives marketed by Mylan N.V. (“Mylan”), while providing bioequivalent delivery of lidocaine via an efficient drug delivery system. Our product is lighter, thinner and provides for a better patient experience without compromise to dermal safety and with no presentation of dermal sensitization. Below is a comparison of the key advantages of ZTlido to Lidoderm and generic lidocaine patches manufactured by Teva and by Mylan.
 
Key Advantages of ZTlido vs. Lidoderm and Associated Generics
 



Note: DIA = Drug-in-adhesive
 
* Source: A Scilex-sponsored head-to-head comparative adhesion study (SCI-LIDO-ADH-003)
 
ZTlido has been strategically designed to address poor adhesion, a leading complaint associated with other currently marketed topical lidocaine products. ZTlido uses an advanced hot-melt technology, which uses premixing and hot-melt mixing of various excipients and lidocaine, followed by current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) compliant coating, lining, cutting and filling processes. In clinical studies, the technology provided significantly improved adhesion over Lidoderm® (a branded, prescription 5% lidocaine patch product) (“Lidoderm”) and Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch at 12 hours after application. In a head-to-head study of 44 subjects, ZTlido showed statistically significant adhesion at all-time points compared to Lidoderm. Further, ZTlido maintained greater than 90% mean adhesion over the labeled 12-hour administration period while Lidoderm fell below this benchmark within 3 hours. ZTlido also showed superior adhesion when compared to Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch. In this head-to-head study, ZTlido maintained greater than 90% mean adhesion throughout the labeled 12-hour administration period, while Mylan’s generic product had a mean adhesion score of only 80% immediately after application, which progressively worsened over time. The formulation components are also carefully selected to achieve the target adhesion profile without creating dermal sensitization and maintaining a benign irritation profile.
 In two separate studies, adhesion performance of ZTlido was compared to Lidoderm (with 44 subjects) and to Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch (with 24 subjects), as depicted in the diagrams below. Both studies were performed with healthy volunteers using a standard clinical adhesion protocol where adhesion could not be enhanced (i.e., no reinforcement, pressing or reattaching). The level of adhesion was measured immediately after application (Time 0), and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours after application. ZTlido was the only lidocaine product to achieve over 90% adhesion over 12 hours after application in these studies. Maintaining 90% adhesion was a requirement for ZTlido’s NDA approval.
 


The proprietary adhesive system utilized for ZTlido allows for a more efficient delivery of the drug from the patch to the skin. This was supported by a clinical study in which our product achieved a bioequivalent dose of lidocaine while using a reduced drug load (36 mg for ZTlido versus 700 mg for Lidoderm). The drug delivery efficiency of ZTlido lessens the danger of accidental exposure. After 12 hours after application, ZTlido contains approximately 18 mg of residual lidocaine. In comparison, each Lidoderm patch leaves over 650 mg in the patch at the end of the 12-hour administration period. If improperly disposed of, the residual drug poses a risk of accidental exposure to a toxic amount of lidocaine to children, pets and others, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated.
 
The drug delivery efficiency of ZTlido also enables it to be manufactured as a thinner product relative to Lidoderm and Teva’s generic lidocaine patch. We strategically leveraged this property of ZTlido by utilizing a thin patch design with a nonwoven backing cloth that allows for better adhesion of the product. The improved adhesion performance, thinner profile and incorporation of a flexible backing material allows for a product that maintains contact with the skin in contoured areas of the body, when encountering torsional strains arising from normal body movements and during contact with clothing and bedding. While Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch is also thinner than Lidoderm, it incorporates a film backing material that makes the product inflexible with body movements, contributing to its rapid loss in adhesion.
 
The adhesion profile of ZTlido allows the product to be used under moderate exercise conditions (tested in 4 sessions of 30-minutes of stationary bike exercise, cumulatively 2 hours) as captured in the ZTlido label. No ZTlido patches fell off during the entire 12-hour administration period. Lidoderm and the associated generics have not produced any public data on the use of their products by active pain patients under such conditions. ZTlido is also labeled to allow patients to shower and bathe while wearing the patch, which is supported by an adhesion or pharmacokinetic study showing that, while some degree of lifting is observed in these environments, the patches were able to be pressed back down or reattached in the cases where the product completely detached, with no clinically meaningful change in pharmacokinetics. In contrast, Lidoderm and the associated generics are labeled with the effects of water exposure being unknown.
 
Although ZTlido, Lidoderm and the associated generics are all labeled to not be used with heat (e.g., heating pad or blanket), the FDA-approved ZTlido label states that users may apply ZTlido to a treatment site after moderate heat exposure, such as after 15 minutes of heating pad use on a medium setting. This authorized use of ZTlido is of value as heat therapy is widely used in treating pain. In contrast, Lidoderm and the associated generics are not labeled for use with heat.
 
We believe ZTlido has other favorable features compared to Lidoderm and associated generic lidocaine patches such as the inclusion of a perforated release liner and the absence of cold flow. The perforated release liner allows for easier removal of the liner before application, which we believe provides convenience to patients who have dexterity challenges. In contrast, Lidoderm and generic lidocaine patches incorporate a single-sheet release liner, requiring patients to pick at the corners and edges to breach and remove before application. Cold flow is the propensity of the adhesive to migrate from the edges of the product under normal conditions, either in the product envelope or while on the skin. This can lead to difficulties in removing the product from the envelope and/or movement of the product, while on the skin, away from the intended administration site.
 
We launched ZTlido in October 2018 with support from an integrated commercial organization using a dedicated sales force and sales management, marketing and managed care capabilities. We market ZTlido through a dedicated 65-person sales force, targeting over 10,000 primary care physicians, pain specialists, neurologists and palliative care physicians who we believe treat the majority of PHN patients. We are utilizing a multi-channel marketing strategy to expand awareness and utilization of ZTlido. Our managed healthcare account executives have achieved success in adding ZTlido to key formularies, including CVS Caremark/Aetna Commercial, Cigna HealthCare (commercial and Medicare plans), Express Scripts (commercial and most Medicare plans), United Healthcare Commercial, Optum Rx Select Commercial, Anthem BCBS, BCBS Louisiana and Kansas, Lifetime/Excellus BCBS, MedImpact, CareFirst, Elixir Commercial and Medicaid in California, Florida, Idaho, and North Dakota. We believe the benefits of ZTlido, combined with our competitive pricing strategy and our active direct marketing efforts, have driven, and will continue to drive, accelerated sales growth and increased market uptake.
 

We plan to support several investigator-initiated research studies to explore the clinical benefits of using ZTlido in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, neck pain, intercostal neuralgia and other possible indications.

A particularly debilitating complication of back pathology is sciatica, which is a condition caused by mechanical compression of the nerve root, or by the effects of inflammatory mediators arising from a degenerative disc that results in inflammation and damage to the nerve roots. This nerve root compression in the lumbar segment of the spine causes shock-like or burning low back pain ("LBP") combined with pain radiating down along the sciatic nerve through the buttocks and down one leg, sometimes reaching the foot. This often severe and debilitating leg pain is usually associated with symptoms of neuropathy-like numbness and tingling. The estimated lifetime incidence of sciatica ranges from 10% to 40% of the U.S. population, and about one-third of these cases will develop symptoms lasting over a year. According to a report by Decision Resources Group, it was estimated that over 4.8 million patients would suffer from sciatica in the United States in 2022.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations of Existing Treatments
 
As the U.S. population ages, the incidence of sciatica and the need for interventions are expected to continue to increase. For example, from 2000 to 2018, ESIs in Medicare beneficiaries increased by more than 125%.
 
Although there are numerous etiologies of sciatica, and therapies may differ based on the etiology, pain management interventions for sciatica are usually multi-modal. Among the pain management interventions, ESI is considered to be efficacious and has been widely used by physicians across multiple specialties, including anesthesiology, physical medicine and rehabilitation and pain medicine. However, there is no ESI therapy approved by the FDA for sciatica to date, and particulate formulations of glucocorticoids have been associated with severe adverse events.
 
Patients with sciatica have a wide range of invasive and non-invasive treatment options. Surgical intervention options include vertebroplasy, spinal laminectomy, discectomy, microdiscectomy, foraminotomy, intradiscal electrothermal therapy, nucleoplasty, radiofrequency denervation, spinal fusion and artificial disc replacement. These options are generally the last line of treatment because they can result in prolonged recovery time, may not be successful in reducing pain or addressing the underlying cause, and may result in permanent loss of flexibility. For these reasons, less invasive interventions are usually implemented first. Less invasive interventions may include (i) nonpharmacological therapies such as physical therapy, stretching exercises, spinal manipulations or chiropractic therapy, traction, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and biofeedback; (ii) oral pharmaceutical therapies such as NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, opiates, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants; and (iii) injectable pharmaceutical therapies such as off-label use of ESIs or nerve blocks.

ESIs for various back pain syndromes are one of the most common procedures performed in the United States and lumbosacral radicular ESI procedures represent 88% of total ESI procedures. ESIs are used when a patient’s pain is inadequately controlled with oral pain medications, topical systems or interventions such as physical therapy. ESIs have demonstrated efficacy in reducing pain, restoring function, reducing the need for other health care and avoiding

back surgery. However, in addition to not being FDA-approved for the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain, currently-used ESIs also present various risks and challenges.
 
When administering an ESI, many physicians use a particulate steroid (including methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, or betamethasone sodium phosphate or betamethasone sodium acetate) instead of a non-particulate steroid (dexamethasone sodium phosphate) because early studies suggested that the duration of pain relief was longer with the particulates and fewer repeat injections were required, even though dexamethasone is considered an otherwise potent and therapeutically beneficial therapy. Particulate in injectable products is defined as extraneous undissolved particles present in injectable solution products. An example of such particulate is precipitate of insoluble drug form, or suspended drug particle. These steroid particles or their aggregates have at least two mechanisms for neurological damage: (1) they can act as emboli if injected into an artery and are of sufficient size to block small terminal arterioles supplying the brain or spinal cord; and (2) several particulate steroids have an immediate and massive effect on microvascular perfusion because of formation of red blood cell aggregates. These emboli can cause rare but catastrophic neurologic injuries including stroke and spinal cord injury that can result in increased pain, severe permanent disability or death. In addition, fungal meningitis has occurred from the injection of steroids manufactured in a compounding pharmacy that did not adhere to sterility standards.
 
The FDA has been evaluating serious neurologic events with ESIs since 2009, and in 2014, the FDA required a class warning on the currently off-label use of injectable corticosteroids to include information about the risk of serious neurologic events with ESIs. The warning on product labels for all injectable glucocorticoids states that the product is to be used for intramuscular or intravenous purposes only, and specifically includes a warning for serious neurologic adverse reactions with epidural administration. These serious neurologic events have been reported with and without use of fluoroscopy. The class warning also includes a statement that safety and effectiveness of epidural administration of these corticosteroids have not been established.
 
Certain third-party payors have also provided limited coverage of ESIs to date. Based on coverage criteria established by different health care plans and certain Medicare Administrative Contractors, an ESI is considered medically necessary and therefore reimbursable only when certain specific criteria are met.
 
Our Solution
 
We are developing SP-102 to address problems associated with currently available corticosteroid products that are used in practice but not approved for epidural injection or the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain. SP-102 is a Phase 3 sterile dexamethasone sodium phosphate viscous gel formulation of 10 mg dexamethasone at a 5 mg/mL concentration in a pre-filled glass syringe for delivery via an epidural injection. SP-102 allows for the use of the potent dexamethasone and provides for longer residency time at the site of injection through the use of a viscous excipient in lieu of particulates. The product is also formulated without the use of preservatives and packaged in a pre-filled syringe, so as to confer greater physician convenience.
 
Currently-used steroids carry a class warning and are not approved to be administered epidurally for the treatment of sciatica. In fact, there are further warnings that the safety and efficacy of the use of these products following epidural administration has not been established. Their formulations include neurotoxic preservatives, surfactants, suspensions or particulates that carry risks of serious neurologic complications. Unlike currently-used steroids, SP-102 does not contain neurotoxic preservatives, surfactants, suspensions or particulates that carry risk of serious neurologic complications, which we believe may improve safety and the extent of pain relief. By using dexamethasone sodium phosphate, the soluble form of the potent dexamethasone, we believe SP-102 may substantially reduce the risk of embolic events in case of inadvertent intra-arterial administration and enable repeat injections. We expect the

injectable viscous gel product, SP-102, which uses a biocompatible, biodegradable, novel excipient and is protected by multiple patents and patent applications and trade secrets, to prolong the residence time at the injection site and result in extended local activity. We believe SP-102, if successfully developed and approved, has the potential to reduce the disability related to lumbosacral radicular pain and help delay or avoid spine surgery.
 
If approved, SP-102 could become the first FDA-approved ESI product. We believe an FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of sciatica could potentially benefit from first-to-market advantage if it can be shown to reduce or delay the need for expensive and potentially risky interventions such as spinal surgery and decrease the use of opioids. SP-102 benefits from our substantial intellectual property portfolio and other technical barriers to entry for potential competitors. Further, we are a party to an exclusive supply agreement for a proprietary biocompatible viscosity-enhancing excipient sodium hyaluronate in SP-102. Our complex manufacturing process, specialized equipment and know-how for sterile viscous product candidates are also key to our competitive edge.
 
We are currently evaluating data on SP-102 from a pivotal Phase 3 Corticosteroid Lumbar Epidural Analgesia (“CLEAR”) trial, which was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in the proposed indication. The CLEAR clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 401 patients with sciatica at over 40 sites across the United States, with a primary objective to evaluate the analgesic effect on average leg pain (as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale in the affected leg) following a single epidural injection of SP-102, compared to an intramuscular injection of placebo over four weeks. A full 6-months data analysis was completed in February 2022 and we announced final results from the study in March 2022, which results reflect achievement of primary and secondary endpoints. We believe these final results are supportive of a breakthrough therapy designation for sciatica that, in addition to the fast track designation, is expected to allow the FDA to further expedite the overall development program leading to market approval. We also presented the pivotal Phase 3 trial results at the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians annual meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada in May 2022.
 
The Phase 3 CLEAR trial summary results, which results reflect achievement of primary and secondary endpoints, are as follows:
 •SP-102 (SEMDEXA), with 401 patients enrolled in the C.L.E.A.R. trial (Corticosteroid Lumbosacral Epidural Analgesia in Radiculopathy), demonstrated a rapid onset of pain relief, measured by Numeric Pain Rating Scale of average daily pain in the affected leg, with improvement against placebo over the first 4 weeks, following a single transforaminal injection, LS Mean (SEM) difference -1.08 (0.17), with a p-value < 0.001.
 •SP-102 (SEMDEXA) showed continued reduction of pain beyond one month, and the median time to open-label repeat injection was 99 days (95% CI: 78, 129 days) according to a Kaplan-Meier estimation. By contrast, off-label injectable steroids typically provide pain relief for periods ranging from less than a week and up to one month, and then a repeat injection may be required.
 •The key secondary endpoint of Oswestry Disability Index, the gold standard for measuring degree of disability and estimating quality of life, showed a 28% improvement at 4 weeks on SP-102 (SEMDEXA) compared to baseline (minimal clinically meaningful improvement 8%-12%)15. The LS Mean (SEM) difference as compared to placebo was -6.28 (1.49), with a p-value < 0.001.
 •There were no adverse events (“AEs”) of special interest reported, such as paraplegia, hematoma, or infection at the injection site, which events are associated with the off-label use of non-approved injectable steroid preparations. Of the 354 patients receiving at least a single injection of SP-102, there were 125 (35.3%) patients experiencing treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”), with 32 (9.0%) patients experiencing treatment-related AEs, 16 (4.5%) patients experiencing medication-related AEs, 23 (6.5%) patients experiencing procedure-related AEs, four (1.1%) 
 
patients experiencing serious AEs, and one (0.3%) patient experiencing AEs related to early withdrawal. Of the 47 patients only receiving a single placebo injection (and no repeat injection of SP-102), there were 14 (29.8%) patients experiencing TEAEs with (i) two (4.3%) patients experiencing treatment-related AEs, (ii) two (4.3%) patients experiencing medication-related AEs, (iii) one (2.1%) patient experiencing procedure-related AEs, (iv) one (2.1%) patient experiencing serious AEs, (v) one (2.1%) patient experiencing AEs related to early withdrawal, and (vi) one (2.1%) patient death. TEAEs occurring in ≥ two percent of patients were headache (SP-102: 13 (6.4%), 17 events; placebo: 11 (5.5%), 11 events), injection site pain (SP-102: 4 (2.0%), four events; placebo: zero (0.0%), 0 events), upper respiratory tract infection (SP-102: two (1.0%), 2 events; placebo: four (2.0%) events), sinusitis (SP-102: 4 (2.0%), four events; placebo zero (0.0%), 0 events) and hypertension (SP-102: four (2.0%), four events; placebo: one (0.5%), two events). The C.L.E.A.R trial also established the safety of repeat injections, as patients who experienced moderate-to-severe radicular pain between 4 and 23 weeks were allowed to receive open-label additional SP-102 (SEMDEXA) injection. The safety analysis was comparable between treatment groups through 4, 12 and 24 weeks of study period.
 
Phase 3 SP-102 C.L.E.A.R Trial - Primary Endpoint
 





SP-103
 
We are developing SP-103 to be a triple-strength, non-aqueous lidocaine topical system for the treatment of acute LBP. SP-103 leverages the same adhesive drug delivery formulation and manufacturing as ZTlido along with comparable backing material, perforated release liner and container-closure system. The increase in drug load is offset by a corresponding decrease in the adhesive diluent.
Acute LBP Market Overview
 
The safe and effective treatment of acute LBP addresses a high unmet need and creates large market opportunities. LBP affects about 70% of people in resource-rich countries at some point in their lives. Acute LBP can be self-limiting, however. One year after an initial episode, as many as 33% of people still have moderate-intensity pain and 15% have severe pain. Acute LBP has a high recurrence rate with 75% of those with a first episode having a recurrence. Although acute episodes may resolve completely, they may increase in severity and duration over time. Americans spent approximately $134.5 billion in 2016 on treating LBP and neck pain, which was the highest expenditure among 154 conditions studied by the Department of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.
Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations of Existing Treatments
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2018, 28.0% of men and 31.6% of women aged 18 years old and older had lower back pain in the past three months. The percentage of women who had lower back pain increased as age increased. Among men, the percentage increased with age through age 74 years and then decreased. Women in the age groups 18 - 44, 45 - 64, and 75 years and older were more likely to have lower back pain in the past three months than were men in the same age groups, but percentages were similar between men and women in the age group 65-74 years. Although most patients recover quickly with minimal treatment, proper evaluation is imperative to identify rare cases of serious underlying pathology. Certain red flags should prompt aggressive treatment or referral to a spine specialist, whereas others are less concerning. Serious red flags include significant trauma related to age (i.e., injury related to a fall from a height or motor vehicle crash in a young patient, or from a minor fall or heavy

lifting in a patient with osteoporosis or possible osteoporosis), major or progressive motor or sensory deficit, new-onset bowel or bladder incontinence or urinary retention, loss of anal sphincter tone, saddle anesthesia, history of cancer metastatic to bone and suspected spinal infection. Without clinical signs of serious pathology, diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing often are not required. Although there are numerous treatments for nonspecific acute LBP, most have little evidence of benefit. Patient education and medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and muscle relaxants are beneficial.
 
Our Solution
 
Our triple-strength SP-103 is an investigational, non-aqueous lidocaine topical system undergoing clinical development in acute LBP conditions. If approved, we believe that SP-103 could become the lidocaine topical product for acute LBP indications. All current uses of topical lidocaine products for LBP are off-label. This program builds on the learnings from ZTlido because both products share the same adhesive drug delivery formulation and manufacturing technology.
 
We are developing SP-103 to deliver a dose of lidocaine that is at least threefold higher than any approved lidocaine topical products (including the approved ZTlido, which has a drug load of 36 mg lidocaine). We manufacture SP-103 to have a drug load of 108 mg lidocaine in a similar adhesive formulation as ZTlido, along with comparable backing material, perforated release liner and container-closure system.
 
SP-103 has demonstrated delivery of threefold the level of drug of ZTlido, and consequently delivers threefold the level of drug of Lidoderm and associated generics by extrapolation. SP-103 has been granted fast track designation by the FDA and, if approved, could become the first FDA-approved lidocaine topical product for the treatment of acute LBP. We believe SP-103, if successfully developed and approved, may be able to address the limitations of prescription lidocaine patches in treating acute LBP by delivering a higher dose of lidocaine to the application site, but with systemic exposure of drug remaining well below established safety thresholds. SP-103 has three times the drug load of ZTlido (108 mg versus 36 mg) in the adhesive system and can potentially deliver threefold the level of the drug within a targeted area, with the convenience of a single topical system. This level of dosage for SP-103 is comparable to the maximum approved daily dosage of ZTlido, or three topical systems for up to 12 hours during a 24- hour period. By contrast, delivering higher levels of drug with other lidocaine patches is encumbered by the underlying hydrogel technology that constrains the level of drug that can be loaded into the adhesive of those products. The level of drug product in such patches can be increased only with a thicker adhesive layer, which can result in a loss of adhesion performance and flexibility. Further, increasing product dimensions can allow delivery of the drug over a larger area, but does not increase drug delivery to a localized area under the topical system.
 
We believe the acute LBP market presents an attractive commercial opportunity due to the large patient population, lack of any approved drugs and high level of unmet medical need. We believe developing and commercializing a topical non-opioid product targeting this segment of the pain population represents a commercially attractive strategy.
 
We intend initially to evaluate SP-103 in a Phase 2 trial in subjects who have acute LBP. The study design is planned as an enriched-enrollment, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over, multicenter study of SP-103 and placebo in subjects with acute LBP. The study consists of a 7-day open-label run-in period where all subjects receive active treatment. Responders to treatment then will be randomized to blinded Treatment A, consisting of 30 days treatment with SP-103 or Treatment B, consisting of 30 days treatment with placebo patch with no lidocaine. We initiated the Phase 2 trial in the second quarter of 2022.
 

SP-104
 
We are developing SP-104 for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules are routinely used off-label to treat fibromyalgia and other chronic pain conditions such as complex regional pain.
 
Fibromyalgia Market Overview
 
Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 10 million people in the United States and an estimated 3% to 6% of the world population. While it is most prevalent in women, it also occurs in men and children of all ethnic groups. Fibromyalgia is the second most common disorder that rheumatologists encounter, seen in 15% of evaluated patients. Approximately 8% of patients cared for in primary care clinics have fibromyalgia. Prominent fibromyalgia researchers and specialists estimate the economic burden of fibromyalgia in the United States to be between $12 billion to $14 billion each year and the condition accounts for a loss of 1% to 2% of the national overall productivity.
Potential Complications of Fibromyalgia
 
The following is a non-exhaustive list of complications of fibromyalgia:
 •extreme allodynia with high levels of distress;
 •opioid or alcohol dependence;
 •marked functional impairment;
 •severe depression and anxiety;
 •obesity and physical deconditioning; and
 •metabolic syndrome.
 

Although fibromyalgia is frequently grouped with arthritis-related conditions, there is no apparent inflammation or damage to the joints, muscles or other tissues. The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia are detailed in the chart below.
 


Currently approved products for pain in fibromyalgia, including duloxetine, pregabalin and milnacipran, have limited efficacy. Responders applying such products can only demonstrate a 27% to 40% reduction of symptoms, which is far below the commonly accepted threshold of 50% to prove efficacy in treating fibromyalgia. In light of this, we believe new treatments with higher efficacy are needed to improve management of fibromyalgia.
 
Our Solution
 
SP-104 has key clinical data supporting its use in fibromyalgia. There are investigational trials that support use and development of SP-104 for fibromyalgia. Currently there are no low-dose formulations (i.e., less than 5 mg) available. Physicians currently use the commercially available high-dose tablets (50 mg) and have compounding pharmacies aliquot lower doses for patients. Pharmacy-compounding is inherently inaccurate and does not involve analyses to confirm that the aliquoted product has the target level of drug, and there is no assurance as to content uniformity within a batch as well as other quality attributes critical for pharmaceutical product performance. This approach can lead to errors in dosing and challenges with titration. The commercial products and pharmacy-compounded products also allow for the immediate release of the drug in the stomach, which can lead to compliance challenges due to severe side effects. Common side effects for naltrexone include hyperalgesia, dysphoria, insomnia and anxiety. All these issues culminate into patient compliance issues and result in the eventual abandonment of an otherwise viable therapy to treat this debilitating disease.
 

Our SP-104 uses delayed burst release technology that bypasses the stomach and releases the drug in the gut (upper intestine). When taking SP- 104 at night before bed, peak drug levels are achieved at night during sleep, allowing the patient to avoid conscious perception of hyperalgesia and other side effects. The combination of the delayed-release and administration at night may also maximize efficacy as most endorphin/ enkephalin release is during sleep, which maximizes the product’s potential to elicit compensatory response.
 
We are committed to develop SP-104 for fibromyalgia. Phase 1 studies are designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic and safety profile of SP-104, and Scilex intends to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2023. If successful, we believe SP-104 can become a pivotal treatment for management of fibromyalgia, which represents a large commercial opportunity with high unmet demands.
 
Commercialization and Market Access
 
Sales & Marketing
 
We have built a robust and integrated commercial infrastructure using a dedicated sales force and sales management, marketing and managed care capabilities, to maximize the potential of our current marketed product, ZTlido, and our two other FDA-approved products, GLOPERBA and ELYXYB, and to commercialize our product candidates, if approved. We are focused on achieving accelerated sales growth and increased market uptake for ZTlido in the topical lidocaine product market, where we believe we have the only actively promoted product. Our dedicated 65-person sales force has broad experience in pain management and is exclusively focused on promoting ZTlido. Our sales representatives leverage their established relationships to call on over 10,000 target pain specialists, neurologists, select primary care providers and palliative care physicians who Scilex believes treat the majority of PHN patients. We believe these same call points provide treatment for the sciatica and acute LBP patients that could benefit from SEMDEXA and SP-103, if approved. Our sales representatives typically have over 10 years of experience in promoting a broad scope of pain management products that Scilex intends to leverage as our product candidates are commercialized.
 
As of December 31, 2022, ZTlido had gained approximately 11.4% market share of the lidocaine patch prescription market across the territories we cover in the United States. The total prescriptions of ZTlido for the year ended December 31, 2022 grew by more than 50.4% over the year ended December 31, 2021, according to Symphony Healthcare’s national prescription data. Our experienced sales representatives and managers are supported by our marketing team, whose members have successfully launched over 20 products with large pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Our marketing team has developed a multi-channel marketing strategy to promote the continued uptake of ZTlido by highlighting its significantly improved adhesion and continuous pain relief throughout the 12-hour administration period. We are also promoting ZTlido with a marketing campaign that engages patients seeking relief for neuropathic pain associated with PHN through social media and medical and consumer journals. Further, our marketing function is supported by an experienced analytics team that leverages its experience in forecasting and analytics to draw insights from healthcare databases to inform our marketing strategy. As part of our broader commercial strategy, our marketing analytics team is conducting market research to support the launch of SP-102, SP-103 and SP-104, if any of these candidates is approved. We believe that our sales force, supporting commercial infrastructure and established relationships with our targeted physician audience will provide a strategic advantage in pursuing potential partnerships to commercialize other non-opioid pain management therapeutics.
 

Market Access
 
We have established a patient-centric market access function with robust capabilities across the market access continuum, including payor sales, contracting and marketing strategies, supplemental patient assistance programs and responsible drug pricing to support patients’ access to ZTlido. Our team of managed healthcare account executives has demonstrated experience in establishing products on formularies and have currently prioritized and targeted select payor accounts representing approximately 275 million of the over 300 million lives, with the remaining 25 million to be considered in the future. Currently, ZTlido is covered for over 200 million lives in the United States and coverage continues to improve. As of January 2023, we have secured coverage for ZTlido on CVS Caremark/Aetna Commercial, Cigna HealthCare (commercial and Medicare plans), Express Scripts (commercial and most Medicare plans), United Healthcare Commercial, Optum Rx Select Commercial, Anthem BCBS, BCBS Louisiana and Kansas, Lifetime/Excellus BCBS, MedImpact, CareFirst, Elixir Commercial and Medicaid in California, Florida, Idaho, and North Dakota. We continue to negotiate coverage with large payors and pharmacy benefit managers in all books of business.
ZTlido Formulary Coverage - Over 90% of Lives Covered or In Negotiation
 


We utilize an outside vendor to administer a patient assistance program directed at patients with commercial insurance or those paying out-of-pocket. With the copay assistance program, qualifying patients do not have to pay any copayment for their ZTlido prescription. We utilize an external vendor and train the sales force to work proactively with clinician office managers in completing required forms for prior authorization for ZTlido.
Clinical Development Overview
 
ZTlido
 
Clinical Trial Highlights
 
We have evaluated ZTlido in over 600 subjects in clinical trials to support marketing approval and promotional campaigns for the relief of neuropathic pain associated with PHN in the United States. Our studies sought to investigate the bioequivalence of ZTlido compared to Lidoderm, adhesion performance and the dermal safety and tolerability of ZTlido under a range of application times and settings. Based on these studies, we concluded that ZTlido:
 •demonstrated bioequivalence to Lidoderm in study SCI-LIDO-PK-002A;
 •showed greater than or equal to 90% adhesion in over 90% of the subjects at the end of the 12-hour administration period in study SCI-LIDO-ADH-001;
 •showed superior adhesion to Lidoderm and Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch in studies SCI-LIDO-AHD-002 and SCI-LIDO-ADH-003;
 •was not meaningfully impacted by heat or exercise in study SCI-LIDO-HEX-001;
 •was able to be used under showering and bathing conditions in study SCI-LIDO-ADH-004; and
 •did not show clinically meaningful dermal irritation in study SCI-LIDO-DERM-001.
 
ZTlido Study Details
 
Pivotal Bioequivalence Study - SCI-LIDO-PK-002A
 
We conducted a comparative single-dose pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study between ZTlido and Lidoderm designed as a two-way cross-over in 54 healthy subjects. In this trial design, each subject received a single dose of three ZTlido or three Lidoderm patches followed by a washout period and the administration of the other product. The purpose of this study was to establish bioequivalence between the products, which was determined by the statistical comparability of Cmax and AUC as shown in the figure below.
 
This was considered the pivotal clinical trial for ZTlido, as it provided the pharmaceutical bridge between the two products and showed that ZTlido had comparable safety and efficacy to Lidoderm. As a result of successfully establishing the pharmaceutical bridge, no stand-alone clinical efficacy studies were required by the FDA to determine ZTlido’s analgesic effects for ZTlido’s approval.

Pivotal Adhesion Study - SCI-LIDO-ADH-001
 
We conducted an open-label, single-treatment, single-period, single-application adhesion performance study in 54 healthy, human subjects to assess the adhesion performance of ZTlido over the 12-hour administration period of the product. The study also investigated whether ZTlido met an FDA established adhesion performance benchmark of greater than or equal to 90% adhesion in greater than or equal to 90% of subjects in the study at the end of the administration period. At the end of the 12-hour administration period, over 90% of the subjects (49 out of the 54 subjects) maintained greater than or equal to 90% adhesion, with no adverse events reported during the study.
ZTlido Maintained Greater Than 90% Adhesion Over the 12-Hour Time Period
 


This study was considered the pivotal adhesion study for marketing approval and is summarized in the product label.
 
Head-to-Head Adhesion Study versus Lidoderm - SCI-LIDO-ADH-002
 
We conducted an open label, single-treatment, three-period, single-application adhesion performance study in 44 healthy, human subjects to evaluate the adhesion performance of ZTlido compared to the adhesion performance of Lidoderm over a 12-hour administration period.
 
In this study, ZTlido demonstrated significantly superior mean adhesion scores compared to Lidoderm at 3, 5, 9 and 12 hours after application. ZTlido maintained a mean percent adhesion performance greater than 90% over the 12-hour administration period, while Lidoderm fell below 90% mean adhesion within three hours.
 

ZTlido Demonstrated Superior Adhesion Compared to Lidoderm
 


Head-to-Head Adhesion Study versus Mylan’s Generic - SCI-LIDO-ADH-003
 
We conducted an open-label, single-treatment, two-period, single-application adhesion performance study in 24 healthy, human subjects to evaluate the adhesion performance of ZTlido compared to the adhesion performance of a generic lidocaine patch 5% manufactured by Mylan over a 12-hour administration period. The purpose of this study was to compare the adhesion performance of ZTlido against a topical lidocaine product involving a non-aqueous formulation. We selected Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch as a comparator because it has similar product characteristics, including a non-aqueous polymer drug-in-adhesive system allowing for a thinner patch and a lower drug load as compared to Lidoderm.
 
In this study, ZTlido demonstrated significantly superior adhesion performance compared to Mylan’s generic lidocaine patch. ZTlido maintained a mean adhesion greater than 90% over the 12-hour administration period, while the generic product had a mean adhesion score of only 80% immediately after application, which declined to a mean adhesion score of 27% at 12 hours after application.
 

ZTlido Demonstrated Superior Adhesion Compared to Mylan’s Generic Lidocaine Patch
 


PK and Adhesion Study under Exercise and Heat Conditions - SCI-LIDO-HEX-001
 
We conducted an open-label, randomized, three-treatment, three-sequence, three-period, cross-over, PK and adhesion performance study of three ZTlido topical systems applied to separate areas in 12 healthy, human subjects during physical exercise, exposure to heat and under normal conditions, respectively. The three treatment periods were as follows:
 •Treatment A sought to assess the PK and adhesion performance of ZTlido under physical exercise conditions. In this treatment period, subjects were instructed to perform exercise for 30 minutes on a stationary bike achieving a heart rate of 108 beats per minute, with continuous heart monitoring during exercise. Subjects were instructed to perform exercise immediately after the application of the topical system and at 2.5, 5.5 and 8.5 hours following application of the topical system.
 •Treatment B sought to assess the PK and adhesion performance of ZTlido under heat conditions. In this treatment period, a heating pad adjusted to the medium setting was applied for 20 minutes immediately after application of the topical system and at 8.5 hours following application of the topical system.
 •Treatment C sought to assess the PK and adhesion performance of ZTlido under normal conditions. In this treatment period, topical systems were applied to the mid-lower back and worn for 12 hours.
 

In treatment A, adhesion and PK performance were not compromised by exercise, as reflected in the product label. In treatment B, heat had an effect on PK but had no effect on adhesion. In Treatment C, normal PKs were observed and greater than 90% of subjects showed greater than 90% adhesion. No meaningful irritation was observed across all treatments across all time points in any of the subjects.
 
The impact of heat and exercise on PK is presented in the figure below. It was observed that heat had an effect on Cmax, but the drug returned to normal levels after removal of heat and there was no clinically meaningful observed effect on AUC. Heat did not appear to have a deleterious or catastrophic effect on topical system performance, either as a dose-dump (i.e., immediate and complete release of all drug from the product), or as reduced drug delivery (i.e., much lower systemic exposure). There was no significant effect on PK observed with exercise when compared to subjects under normal conditions.

Dermal Sensitization and Irritation Study - SCI-LIDO-DERM-001
 
We conducted a provocative dermal sensitization and irritation human clinical trial, also referred to as a repeat insult topical system test, intended to elicit the worst-case dermal safety of ZTlido by extended wearing of the product over multiple days. In this trial, we compared the sensitization potential, and the overall irritation profiles of ZTlido and Lidoderm in 218 normal and healthy subjects. We used a 7-point scale where a score of 0 indicated no irritation and a score of 7 was considered a strong reaction spreading beyond the application site.
 
In this study, results showed that the adhesion quality of ZTlido did not compromise dermal safety. The study reported that ZTlido did not show potential for dermal sensitization and showed an overall benign irritation profile. Both ZTlido and Lidoderm had a mean irritation score well below 1, which is defined as barely perceptible erythema. This study allowed for the ZTlido label to adopt the same local tolerance language as labeled for Lidoderm.
 

Photoallergy and Phototoxicity Studies - SCI-LIDO-PHOT0-001 and SCI-LIDO-PHOTO-002
 
We conducted a 6-week randomized study, SCI-LIDO-PHOTO-001, to evaluate the potential of ZTlido and its comparator, Lidoderm, to induce a photoallergic skin reaction in 54 healthy volunteers. In this study, we observed that ZTlido was not photoallergenic.
 
We conducted a 4-day, randomized study, SCI-LIDO-PHOTO-002, to evaluate the irritation potential of ZTlido and its comparator, Lidoderm, when application to skin is followed by light exposure in 32 healthy volunteers, using a phototoxicity patch test. In this study, we observed that ZTlido was not phototoxic.
 
Post-Approval Studies for ZTlido
 
Water Stress Study (Shower and Swimming) - SCI-LIDO-ADH-004
 
We conducted a single-dose study in 24 subjects to examine the adhesion and lidocaine delivery (pharmacokinetics) of ZTlido when it is exposed to two separate water stress conditions of (1) showering (10 minutes) and (2) swimming (15 minutes). The study showed that while some degree of product lifting was observed, the product could be pressed back down or reattached with no further diminished adhesion performance or drug delivery. This study led to a change in the product label indicating that patients may use the product while showering or bathing. This provides significant patient convenience as Lidoderm and the associated generics are labeled to avoid contact with water such as bathing, swimming or showering, as these products may not stick if they get wet. With ZTlido, patients can engage in these activities within the 12-hour administration period.
 
Investigator-Sponsored Studies
 
We plan to support several investigator-initiated research studies to evaluate the clinical benefits of using ZTlido in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, neck pain, intercostal neuralgia and other possible indications.
 
SP-102 (SEMDEXA)
 
We recently conducted a Phase 3 pivotal study of SP-102. The Corticosteroid Lumbar Epidural Analgesia for Radiculopathy (“CLEAR”) study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial that enrolled 401 patients with sciatica to compare the epidural administration of SP-102 to placebo. We announced final results from this study in March 2022. We also presented the pivotal Phase 3 trial results at the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians annual meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada in May 2022.
Clinical Trial Highlights
 
SP-102 has been evaluated in a number of preclinical studies and clinical trials as a potential treatment for sciatica. Key findings from the preclinical studies and clinical trials include:
 •Repeat injections of SP-102 showed continued pain reduction with no unexpected adverse events based on preliminary results from the SP-102-03 study;
 •SP-102 showed an extended local activity with epidural administration in the ES-1504 study;
 
•SP-102 showed an extended residence time and tolerability in the 1014-1512 and the 1014-2847, preclinical studies; and
 •The introduction of SP-102 into blood vessels did not result in neurological complications in the UPD003-IS21 preclinical toxicology study.
 
SP-102 (SEMDEXA) Study Details Phase 3 Pivotal Clinical Trial - CLEAR
 
We recently conducted a pivotal, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial, CLEAR, that enrolled 401 patients with sciatica at over 40 sites across the United States. The study includes an open-label extension where subjects will be followed for up to 24 weeks after treatment to evaluate the safety of administering SP-102 in a larger patient population. After week 4, subjects who met certain pain criteria received open-label SP-102 to investigate the safety of repeat injections and the duration of pain relief following injection. This well-controlled, randomized trial was designed to demonstrate evidence of the analgesic effect and safety of SP-102. The schematic of this Phase 3 trial is demonstrated in the flowchart below.
 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of SP-102 on average leg pain, measured using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (“NPRS”) following a single transforaminal injection. These results were compared to an intra-muscular injection of placebo over a four-week period. The secondary objectives of this study include (i) evaluation of the degree of disability over time as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index; (ii) characterization of the change of the subject’s radiculopathy symptoms and overall condition, using a combination of PainDETECT, modified Brief Pain Inventory, Clinical Global Impression of Change, and Patient Global Impression of Change and (iii) evaluation of the safety of a single and repeat SP- 102 injections.
 
Schematic of CLEAR - SP-102 (SEMDEXA) Phase 3 Pivotal Trial
 


Enrollment was completed in the second half of 2021. We announced final data from this study in March 2022. The Pivot Phase 3 trial has met the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy endpoints:
 •For the primary endpoint of change in average daily pain (as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale) in the affected leg over four weeks following the initial injection, the LS Mean (SE) group difference of -1.08 (0.17) compared to placebo with a p-value less than 0.001.
 
•The two key secondary endpoints assessing Oswestry Disability Index (“ODI”) and Time to open label repeat injection have been demonstrated for SP-102. The LS Mean (SE) group difference in ODI compared to placebo at week 4 was -6.28 (1.49) with a p-value less than 0.001. A Cox proportional hazard model showed significantly longer duration of initial SP-102 (SEMDEXA) treatment compared to placebo Hazard Ratio (95% CI) 0.49 (0.36, 0.65), with a p-value less than 0.001.
 
Phase 2 Repeat Dose Study - SP-102-03
 
We conducted an open-label, single-arm, pharmacodynamics (“PD”) and safety study of repeat epidural injections of SP-102 in patients with sciatica. We conducted this study to characterize repeat dose PD with respect to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression using plasma cortisol levels, white blood cell count and blood glucose levels.
 
The study enrolled 19 subjects, of which 15 received repeat SP-102 epidural injections 4 to 8 weeks after the initial injection. Four of the subjects did not experience recurrent pain and thus did not require a repeat injection. The daily average, current and worst pain in the affected leg and back showed continuous reduction throughout the 28-day observation period for both treatments. Based on a preliminary review of the results, SP-102 injections were generally well-tolerated and there were no new unexpected adverse events observed.

Phase 1 Trial of SP-102 (SEMDEXA) Compared to Reference Listed Drug - ES-1504
 
We conducted an open-label, single-arm, two-period, fixed sequential-dose study to evaluate the PK, PD and safety of SP-102 when administered by epidural injection. SP-102 was compared to intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection in subjects with lumbosacral radiculopathy. There were 12 subjects enrolled in this study, all of whom received SP-102 followed by the intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection (Reference Listed Drug) administered one month later. A Reference Listed Drug is an approved drug product to which new versions are compared to show that they are bioequivalent. The purpose of this study was to establish the pharmaceutical bridge between SP-102 and the Reference Listed Drug. The Tmax observed with the administration of SP-102 was four hours, compared to 15 minutes observed with intravenous dexamethasone. The PD parameters and safety results of both products were similar, and SP-102 did not prolong cortisol suppression time. SP-102 also maintained analgesic effects throughout a one-month observation period.
 

The overall systemic exposure of dexamethasone was similar, whether administered as SP-102 or injected intravenously, with a mean AUCinf of 0.916 μg*h/mL (observed with SP-102) compared to 0.943 μg*h/mL (observed with intravenously-administered dexamethasone). Notably, there was a 16- fold increase in the time to maximum serum concentration (“Tmax”) following epidural injection of SP-102. The median Tmax was 4.00 hours for SP-102 compared to 0.25 hours for the comparison group. All 12 subjects with sciatica showed continuous reduction in back and leg pain during the one-month observation period following a single epidural injection of SP-102.
 
This study demonstrated that at an equivalent initial dose of dexamethasone, the systemic exposure to dexamethasone following epidural injection of SP-102 did not exceed the exposure following intravenous injection of the Reference Listed Drug. The PD effects, measured as white blood cell count, cortisol levels and glucose levels, as well as the safety profile, were similar between the two treatments. SP-102 injections were generally well-tolerated and did not result in new unexpected side effects.
 
Toxicology Studies - Study Nos. 1014-1512 and 1014-2847
 
We conducted PK and toxicology studies in two non-rodent animal species to assess SP-102 administered via epidural and intrathecal routes with single and multiple dose regimens. Pharmacokinetically, a prolonged increase in the active dexamethasone metabolite was consistent with the extended residence time of the viscous gel formulation of SP-102 at the site of injection. There were no new unexpected toxicology findings apart from well-characterized toxicity findings commonly observed with administration of dexamethasone sodium phosphate.
Preclinical Toxicology Study - UPD003-IS21
 
We conducted a preclinical toxicology study designed to simulate the accidental introduction of epidural steroids into arterial blood vessels providing blood supply to the spinal cord, which is a major cause of neurological complications associated with current administration of suspension steroids containing particulates.A2 mL (10 mg of dexamethasone) injection of SP-102 was injected over 1-2 minutes into the vertebral artery of large animal species.

Pre- and post-dose angiography showed no remarkable changes and all animals survived for approximately 24 hours until euthanasia. The veterinary animal health report and the pathology report concluded there were no vascular, spinal cord or brain injuries associated with injection into the vertebral artery of the animals.
 
Hydrodynamic Study - SP-PC002
 
We conducted a hydrodynamic study of SP-102 in non-rodent animal species, which showed that epidural administration of SP-102 demonstrated an increased local residence half-life and a decreased flow from the injection site.
Intravascular Injection Study - SEM-005
 We conducted a study to evaluate the accidental intravascular injection of SP-102 into the vertebral artery of non-rodent animals. There were no adverse clinical signs associated with the accidental intra-arterial injection of SP-102 following a 24-hour survival period.
 

SP-103 (lidocaine topical system) 5.4%
 
SP-103 is an investigational, non-aqueous lidocaine topical system undergoing clinical development in acute LBP. As a higher strength topical lidocaine system, SP-103 will build on the learnings from ZTlido because both products share the same adhesive drug delivery formulation and manufacturing technology. The clinical program involves evaluating the safety and efficacy of SP-103 for the treatment of acute LBP. A Phase 1 study was completed that demonstrated bioequivalent pharmacokinetics between the administration of a single SP-103 and the administration of three commercial ZTlido. The study also showed linear kinetics among multiple applications of SP-103 (i.e., 1, 2 or 3 patches) over a 12-hour administration period. Adhesion performance was assessed and found to be comparable between SP-103 and ZTlido.
 
Specifically, we plan to evaluate SP-103 in the following studies:
 •SP-103-02 is a Phase 2 study of SP-103 in subjects with acute LBP. The study design is planned as an enriched-enrollment, randomized, double-blind, two-period, cross-over, multicenter study of SP-103 versus placebo. The study is expected to consist of a 7-day open-label run-in period where all subjects receive active treatment. Responders to treatment will then be randomized to receive blinded treatment of either SP-103 or placebo. This study will inform on the pivotal Phase 3 study design to support market approval.
 •In addition to a pivotal Phase 3 program, we intend to perform a 3-day PK study of SP-103, an adhesion performance study of SP-103 and an investigational study to evaluate the effects of heat and exercise on the PK and adhesion of SP-103 to support the NDA submission.
 
The Phase 2 trial of SP-103 was initiated in the second quarter of 2022.
 
SP-104 (4.5mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release capsules)
 
Two Phase 1 trials have been completed for SP-104 at investigative sites in New Zealand:
 •SP-104-01 is a food effect and bridging pharmacokinetic study comparing SP-104 to Naltrexone HCL Tablets conducted on approximately 18 healthy adult subjects. The study is designed to be an open-label, three-period, three-treatment, randomized study to characterize the PK and safety and tolerability of SP-104 under fasting and fed conditions. Subjects are randomly administered a single dose of one of three treatments and followed for PK and safety for a period of time followed by a washout period before receiving one of the other treatments. All subjects receive all three treatments. The study characterize the single-dose clinical studies and ultimately the commercial label. The study also serves as a “pharmaceutical bridge” between SP-104 and the commercial reference listed drug (the “RLD”) (Naltrexone HCI tablets, USP 50 mg) to support the eventual Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Assuming that the rate and extent of drug exposure for SP-104 will be lower than that observed for the RLD, this study allows us to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety for the RLD instead of having to perform extensive nonclinical animal safety toxicology studies and establish an extensive clinical safety database. Our development program can focus on establishing efficacy of SP-104 in the treatment of fibromyalgia.
 •SP-104-02 is a Phase 1 study of SP-104 conducted on approximately 52 healthy human subjects. The study is designed to be a double-blind, randomized, two-period, two-treatment crossover study to evaluate the safety of SP-104, compared to immediate release naltrexone capsules. The primary purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that, when taken at night, the delayed release of 4.5 mg Naltrexone mitigates
 
 against adverse events known for the drug and could affect patient compliance in maintaining treatment for their fibromyalgia. In a small (n=52) cross-over trial in healthy volunteers comparing SP-104 (naltrexone hydrochloride delayed-release 4.5 mg) to naltrexone hydrochloride immediate release 4.5 mg (the “compared drug”), there were no serious adverse effects, no AEs leading to discontinuation, no meaningful differences in physical examinations, vital signs, or laboratory parameters between treatments, no severe AEs for either treatment. Of the 52 patients receiving at least a single injection of SP-104, there were 21 (40%) patients experiencing at least one TEAE, 14 (27%) patients experiencing at least one treatment-related TEAE, 12 (23%) patients experiencing at least one treatment-related TEAE within 72 hours after first administration of SP-104. Notable AEs of special interest were nausea and headache within 72 hours after first administration of SP-104. SP-104 administered at night before bed resulted in a lower number of subjects with at least one AE (p = 0.0414), and an even lower number of subjects with at least one AE within 72 hours after the first administration of SP-140 when compared to the compared drug. There was a lower number of subjects with AEs of special interest within 72 hours after administration of SP-104 (n=9; 12 events) versus the compared drug (n=15; 20 events). Notable AEs of special interest observed within 72 hours after administration of the applicable drug are nausea (SP-104: n=0; the compared drug: n=3) and headache (SP-104: n=6; the compared drug: n=12). The study randomized subjects to one of two treatments followed by a washout period and then receipt of the other treatment, which allows all subjects to act as their own control. The study will support intellectual property, inform on clinical study design and contribute to safety characterization to support market applications.
 
We completed both studies in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to use data collected from these studies to support an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA, which is expected to enable further clinical development and initiation of a planned multi-center placebo-controlled registration trial in the field of fibromyalgia. The registration trial is designed to be a Phase 3, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter study that meets the regulatory requirements of an “adequate and well-controlled” study to establish the efficacy of SP-104 in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Depending on the outcomes, this registration trial alone may be efficient in supporting market approval of SP-104 or as an additional Phase 3 study may be required.

ZTlido
 
ZTlido is a single-layer, drug-in-adhesive topical delivery system comprised of an adhesive material containing 36 mg lidocaine, which is applied to a pliable nonwoven cloth backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate film release liner. ZTlido is commercially manufactured for us by Oishi Koseido Co., Ltd. (“Oishi”) in Japan. We have exclusive worldwide rights to Oishi’s proprietary formulation and manufacturing technologies except with respect to Japan. ZTlido is manufactured using premixing and hot-melt mixing of various excipients and lidocaine, followed by cGMP compliant coating, lining, cutting and filling processes. ZTlido is packaged as a carton of 30 topical systems, into individual child-resistant envelopes. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Business - Material Agreements - Itochu and Oishi Product Development Agreement” and “Business - Material Agreements - Itochu and Oishi Commercial Supply Agreement” for additional information regarding the manufacturing and supply chain of ZTlido.
 
Once production is complete, commercial product shipments are sent to the United States, where our exclusive third-party logistics distribution provider, Cardinal Health 105, LLC (“Cardinal Health 105”), ships them to temperature-controlled customer distribution centers, which are generally able to deliver finished product to retail pharmacies on the same day, or within 24 hours. We currently contract with multiple pharmaceutical distributors throughout the United States, including McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”), Cardinal Health 110, LLC (“Cardinal Health 110”) and AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen”). Distributors have agreements in place that provide us with access to large retail chains, including CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid and Walmart, as well as independent pharmacies. In addition to all order fulfillment, Cardinal Health 105 performs the following services on our behalf: customer service, credit checks, invoicing, chargebacks, distributor fee for service, government reporting, customer returns, accounts receivable, inventory control, product security (DSCSA serialization) inquiries and recall assistance. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and first quarter of 2022, Cardinal Health 105 was our only customer and sales to Cardinal Health 105 represented all of our net revenue for such periods.
 
As we continue to expand the commercialization of ZTlido, we expanded our direct distribution network to national and regional distributors and pharmacies in the second quarter of 2022. We currently hold wholesaler licenses and commenced selling directly to our main distributor customers as well as pharmacies from the second quarter of 2022. In April 2022, we discontinued our use of “title model” services provided by Cardinal Health 105, but expect that Cardinal Health 105 will continue to perform other third-party logistics services for us.
 
SP-102 (SEMDEXA)
 
SP-102 is a Phase 3 sterile dexamethasone sodium phosphate injectable viscous gel drug product containing dexamethasone sodium phosphate equivalent to 10 mg dexamethasone in a pre-filled glass syringe with a 2 mL deliverable volume. SP-102 also contains sodium hyaluronate, which is a novel, biocompatible, viscosity-enhancing excipient and is listed in the European Pharmacopeia. We have an exclusive supply agreement for sodium hyaluronate for SP-102 from the manufacturer and supplier.
 
SP-102 is manufactured by a single-source manufacturer, which supports the clinical development, including the completed Phase 3 clinical trial of SP-102. In March 2022, we announced final results of the Phase 3 clinical trial, satisfying the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The manufacturing process is proprietary and

includes trade secrets. We plan to engage our existing contract manufacturer, Lifecore, for the commercial production of SP-102, if approved. We plan to use the biocompatible proprietary excipient supplied by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC (“Sanofi”) sodium hyaluronate, pursuant to the Genzyme Supply Agreement, and engage Sanofi for commercial supply of dexamethasone sodium phosphate for SP-102, if approved. See the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Business - Material Agreements - Genzyme Supply Agreement” and “Business - Material Agreements - Lifecore Master Services Agreement” for additional information regarding the manufacturing and supply of the proprietary excipient and contact manufacturing of SP-102 product, respectively.
 
SP-103
 
SP-103 contains 5.4% lidocaine (108 mg lidocaine) and is manufactured for clinical supply by Oishi, using the same manufacturing processes as used for ZTlido. If our Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials are successful, we plan to submit the SP-103 manufacturing protocols in a supplemental new drug application.
 
SP-104
 
We are developing SP-104, a novel low-dose, naltrexone hydrochloride delayed release formulation for treating fibromyalgia. SP-104 is 4.5 mg, low-dose naltrexone hydrochloride delayed release capsule product in clinical development, currently undergoing Phase 1 studies. It is manufactured by a contract manufacturer, Tulex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Tulex”), located in Cranbury, NJ.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The large size and expanding scope of the pain management market makes it an attractive therapeutic area for biopharmaceutical businesses. Our potential competitors include pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of these companies have drug pipelines, readily available capital, and established research and development organizations.
 
ZTlido and our product candidate, SP-103, if approved, face and will likely face competition from prescription, generic, and OTC topical lidocaine patches, including Lidoderm and generic lidocaine patches manufactured by Teva, Mylan and Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. Additionally, SP-103, if approved, will likely compete with various opioid pain medications, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants and anticonvulsants, particularly as we seek approval for the treatment of acute LBP.
 
SP-102, if approved, has the potential to become the first FDA-approved epidural steroid product for the treatment of sciatica. While there are currently no FDA-approved ESIs indicated for the treatment of sciatica, we are aware of certain non-steroid product candidates in development. SP-102, if approved, will compete with various opioid pain medications, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and surgical procedures. Procedures may include nerve blocks and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulations. We may also face indirect competition from the off-label and unapproved use of branded and generic injectable steroids.
 
While there are currently no formulations containing naltrexone in clinical development for the treatment of fibromyalgia, we are aware of certain non-opioid therapeutics currently in a late-stage phase 3 pipeline containing two 505(b)(2) development programs. Our product candidate, SP-104, will likely face direct competition from these candidates.
 

We expect that the market will become increasingly competitive in the future. Many of our competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in: developing product candidates and technologies, undertaking preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining the FDA and other regulatory approvals of product candidates, formulating and manufacturing product candidates and launching, marketing and selling product candidates.
 
Additional mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products as well. Smaller or early-stage companies or generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, products that are more effective or less costly than any product candidate that we are currently developing or that we may develop. If approved, our product candidates will face competition from commercially available drugs as well as drugs that are in the development pipelines of our competitors and later enter the market.
 Established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our product candidates less competitive. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing medicines before we do.
 
The key competitive factors affecting the success of ZTlido, SP-102, SP-103 and SP-104 are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 
Material Agreements
 
Itochu and Oishi Product Development Agreement
 
We are party to the Product Development Agreement with Oishi Koseido Co., Ltd. (“Oishi”) and Itochu Chemical Frontier Corporation (“Itochu,” and together with Oishi, the “Developers”). Pursuant to the Product Development Agreement, the Developers agreed to develop, exclusively for us, lidocaine tape products, including ZTlido and SP-103 (the “Products”). Pursuant to the Product Development Agreement, we obtained the rights to market, sell and distribute the Products in global markets outside of Japan.
 
In carrying out the development responsibilities, the Developers agreed to, among other things, (1) source and provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient for the Products for manufacturing, (2) develop a stable final dosage form of the Products suitable for regulatory approvals, (3) conduct product development activities necessary to support the filing of applications for regulatory approvals for the Products and (4) conduct manufacturing scale-up activities and preclinical studies for the Products. We are responsible for, among other things, (a) conducting all pivotal human clinical trials for the Products, (b) completing all regulatory filings, correspondence and meetings with the FDA or other applicable governmental authorities with respect to the Products and (c) commercially launching the Products. We maintain the ultimate responsibility and decision-making control with regard to the marketing and pricing of the Products.
 

The parties agreed to cooperate in good faith to determine whether to seek or maintain patent protection with respect to the Products, the active pharmaceutical ingredient, any associated method of use, method of manufacturing, or any other invention that could reasonably be expected to affect the commercialization or value of the Products. The Developers have the first right to pursue patent protection for any invention by them. All parties will jointly agree on the appointment of the patent representatives in each country outside of Japan.
 
Until the expiration or termination of the Product Development Agreement, the Developers granted us an exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, worldwide license (except with respect to Japan) under its current and future intellectual property rights relating to the Products and the lidocaine in such Products. As consideration for the Developers’ development obligations under the Product Development Agreement, we agreed to pay a contingent quarterly royalty between 25% and 35% to the Developers based on the net quarterly profits of the Products. In the event that the net profits of any of the first four calendar quarters after the commercial launch equals a negative amount (a “Net Loss”), we are allowed to carry over such Net Loss to apply against all future calendar quarters until such Net Loss is covered, all calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Under the Product Development Agreement, if our total net profits for ZTlido and SP-103 are equal to or less than five percent of our net sales of ZTlido and SP-103 for a period of four or more consecutive quarters, the Developers have the right to terminate the Product Development Agreement and the Commercial Supply Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our net profits for ZTlido and SP-103 have not exceeded five percent of net sales. Accordingly, Oishi and Itochu have the right to terminate the Product Development Agreement and Commercial Supply Agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, neither Oishi nor Itochu has exercised its right of termination. Additionally, if we receive any licensing fees from any third-party sublicensees, we are obligated to pay the same proportions of such licensing fee to the Developers.

The Developers may terminate the Product Development Agreement if we fail to file for regulatory approval for any of the Products within three months of the date on which all required components of the regulatory approval application are received by us.
 
Under the Product Development Agreement, we and the Developers have agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify each other against any third-party liabilities arising out of (1) any breach of our respective representations,

Itochu and Oishi Commercial Supply Agreement
 
Effective February 16, 2017, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Scilex Pharma”) entered into the Commercial Supply Agreement with Itochu and Oishi (the “Commercial Suply Agreement”). Pursuant to the Commercial Supply Agreement, Oishi agreed to manufacture, store, handle and perform quality control testing of the Products (as defined in the Product Development Agreement) at its facility in Japan. Itochu agreed to purchase Products from Oishi and handle the shipping of the Products. Both Oishi and Itochu agreed to provide us with certain technical support regarding the Products as reasonably requested by us, including but not limited to analytical test methods, method development, physical and chemical properties, and use of the Products.
 
Under the Itochu and Oishi Commercial Supply Agreement, we pay per item transfer prices for ZTlido, ZTlido professional samples and ZTlido placebo samples, in each case subject to certain minimum order quantities. We are required to provide a 12-month rolling purchase forecast of the estimated quantities of the Products in writing on a monthly basis. Oishi is required to promptly notify us and Itochu if it lacks the capacity to meet the forecast. All Products ordered by us will be in the form of a firm written purchase order.

Semnur Merger Agreement
 
On March 18, 2019, Legacy Scilex acquired Semnur pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Semnur (as amended, the “Semnur Merger Agreement”), Sigma Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Scilex (“Sigma Merger Sub”), Fortis Advisors LLC, solely as representative of the holders of Semnur equity (the “Semnur Equityholders’ Representative”), and for limited purposes, Sorrento. Pursuant to the Semnur Merger Agreement, Sigma Merger Sub merged with and into Semnur (the “Semnur Merger”), with Semnur surviving as Legacy Scilex’s wholly owned subsidiary.
 
In connection with transactions contemplated by the Semnur Merger Agreement, Sorrento and each of the other holders of outstanding shares of capital stock of Scilex Pharma, contributed each share of Scilex Pharma capital stock it owned to Legacy Scilex in exchange for one share of common stock of Legacy Scilex (“Legacy Scilex Common Stock”), par value $0.0001 per share (the “Contribution”). As a result of the Contribution, and prior to the consummation of the Semnur Merger, Scilex Pharma became a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Scilex and Sorrento became the owner of approximately 77% of Legacy Scilex’s issued and outstanding capital stock. As a result of the Semnur Merger, Scilex Pharma and Semnur became wholly owned subsidiaries of Legacy Scilex.
 
At the closing of the Semnur Merger, Legacy Scilex issued to the holders of Semnur’s capital stock (the “Semnur Equityholders”) and options to purchase Semnur’s common stock, upfront consideration with a value of $70.0 million. The upfront consideration was comprised of the following: (i) a cash payment of approximately $15.0 million, and (ii) $55.0 million in shares of Legacy Scilex Common Stock (47,039,315 shares issued and 352,972 shares issuable, valued at $1.16 per share) (the “Stock Consideration”). A portion of the cash consideration otherwise payable to the Semnur Equityholders was set aside for expenses incurred by the Semnur Equityholders’ Representative, and 4,749,095 shares of Legacy Scilex Common Stock otherwise issuable to Semnur Equityholders were placed in escrow with a third party as security for the indemnification obligations of the Semnur Equityholders under the Semnur Merger Agreement. The expense fund and escrow have since been released per the terms of the escrow agreement. The Semnur Equityholders that received the Stock Consideration were required to sign an exchange and registration rights agreement with Legacy Scilex, which is further described below. Following the issuance of the Stock Consideration, Sorrento ownership in Legacy Scilex was diluted to approximately 58% of Legacy Scilex’s issued and outstanding capital stock.
 

Pursuant to the Semnur Merger Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, Legacy Scilex also agreed to pay the Semnur Equityholders up to $280.0 million in aggregate contingent cash consideration based on the achievement of certain milestones, comprised of a $40.0 million payment that will be due upon obtaining the first approval of a NDA of a Semnur product by the FDA and additional payments that will be due upon the achievement of certain amounts of net sales of Semnur products, as follows: (i) a $20.0 million payment upon the achievement of $100.0 million in cumulative net sales of a Semnur product, (ii) a $20.0 million payment upon the achievement of $250.0 million in cumulative net sales of a Semnur product, (iii) a $50.0 million payment upon the achievement of $500.0 million in cumulative net sales of a Semnur product, and (iv) a $150.0 million payment upon the achievement of $750.0 million in cumulative net sales of a Semnur product. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, none of the foregoing payments have been triggered.
 
The Semnur Merger Agreement also provided that following the consummation of Legacy Scilex’s first bona fide equity financing with one or more third-party financing sources on an arms’ length basis with gross proceeds to Legacy Scilex of at least $40.0 million, certain of the former Semnur optionholders will be paid cash in lieu of: (i) the 352,972 shares of Legacy Scilex Common Stock otherwise issuable to such former Semnur optionholders pursuant to the Semnur Merger Agreement, and (ii) any shares that would otherwise be issued to such former Semnur optionholders upon release of shares held in escrow pursuant to the Semnur Merger Agreement, with such shares in each case valued at $1.16 per share. The Semnur optionholders subsequently agreed, under the terms of the Exchange Agreement (as defined and described below) to forego the foregoing right to any such payment in exchange for the right to participate in the Share Exchange (as defined below).
 
In March 2019, the Semnur Equityholders that received the Stock Consideration were required to sign an Exchange and Registration Rights Agreement with Legacy Scilex (as amended, the “Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, if within 18 months following the closing of the Semnur Merger, 100% of the outstanding equity of Legacy Scilex had not been acquired by a third party or Legacy Scilex had not entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, or otherwise consummated, a firmly underwritten offering of Legacy Scilex capital stock on a major stock exchange that met certain requirements, then holders of the Stock Consideration could collectively elect to exchange, during the 60-day period commencing the date that was the 18 month anniversary of the closing of the Semnur Merger (the “Share Exchange”), the Stock Consideration for shares of Sorrento’s common stock with a value of $55.0 million based on a price per share of Sorrento’s common stock equal to the greater of (a) the 30-day trailing volume weighted average price of one share of Sorrento’s common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) as of the consummation of the Share Exchange and (b) $5.55 (subject to adjustment for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction) (the “Exchange Price”). Pursuant to an amendment to the Exchange Agreement entered into by Sorrento and the Semnur Equityholders’ Representative on September 28, 2020, on October 9, 2020, Sorrento paid $55.0 million in cash to the Semnur Equityholders in lieu of issuing $55.0 million of shares of Sorrento’s common stock at the Exchange Price.

The foregoing is a summary of the material terms of the Semnur Merger Agreement (including the amendment thereto) in the forms filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Aardvark Asset Purchase Agreement
 
In April 2021, Sorrento entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Aardvark Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Aardvark Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aardvark”), pursuant to which, among other things, Sorrento acquired Aardvark’s Delayed Burst Release Low Dose Naltrexone (DBR-LDN) asset and intellectual property rights, for the treatment of

chronic pain, fibromyalgia and chronic post-COVID syndrome (collectively, the “SP-104 Assets”), which includes a Statement of Work dated November 18, 2020 (the “Tulex Statement of Work”), pursuant to which Tulex agreed to, among other things, develop, test and manufacture clinical supplies of SP-104 for Sorrento.
 
Subsequent to the acquisition, Sorrento designated Legacy Scilex to lead all development efforts related to SP-104 and on May 12, 2022, Legacy Scilex and Sorrento entered into a bill of sale and assignment and assumption agreement (the “Bill of Sale”), pursuant to which Sorrento sold, conveyed, assigned and transferred to Legacy Scilex all of its rights, title and interest in and to the SP-104 Assets (including PCT/US2021/053645 and all patents and patent applications that claim priority rights thereto) and Legacy Scilex assumed all of Sorrento’s rights, liabilities and obligations under the Aardvark Asset Purchase Agreement (the “SP-104 Acquisition”).
 
As consideration for the SP-104 Acquisition, Legacy Scilex issued a promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 to Sorrento (the “Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note matures seven years from the date of issuance and bears interest at the rate equal to the lesser of (a) 2.66% simple interest per annum and (b) the maximum interest rate permitted under law. The Promissory Note is payable in cash, shares of Common Stock (any shares so issued, the “Consideration Shares”) or any combination thereof, at Legacy Scilex’s sole discretion, and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without penalty. Legacy Scilex also agreed to file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) a resale registration statement, relating to the resale by Sorrento of any Consideration Shares that may be issued to Sorrento, within 60 days of the issuance of such Consideration Shares.
 
As the successor to the Aardvark Asset Purchase Agreement, Legacy Scilex is obligated to pay Aardvark (i) $3,000,000, upon initial approval by the FDA of a new drug application for the LDN Formulation (as defined in the Aardvark Asset Purchase Agreement) (which amount may be paid in shares of Common Stock or cash, in Legacy Scilex’s sole discretion) (the “Development Milestone Payment”) and (ii) $20,000,000, in cash, upon achievement of certain net sales by Legacy Scilex of a commercial product that uses the LDN Formulation (the “Commercial Product”). Legacy Scilex will also pay Aardvark certain royalties in the single digits based on percentages of annual net sales by Legacy Scilex of a commercial product that uses the LDN Formulation. The royalty percentage is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. Royalties are due for so long as Commercial Product is covered by a valid patent in the country of sale or for ten years following the first commercial sale of the Commercial Product, whichever is longer. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, none of the foregoing payments have been triggered.
 
In connection with its acquisition of the SP-104 Assets, Legacy Scilex has agreed that if it issues any shares of Common Stock in respect of the Development Milestone Payment, Legacy Scilex will prepare and file one or more registration statements with the SEC for the purpose of registering for resale such shares and is required to file such registration statement with the SEC within 60 days following the date on which any such shares are issued.
 Tien-Li Lee, MD, a member of our board of directors (the “Board”), is the founder, chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of Aardvark.

The Tulex Statement of Work is governed by the terms of a master services agreement (the “Tulex Master

Services Agreement”). The Tulex Master Services Agreement was novated to Legacy Scilex on June 15, 2022 and will remain in effect until five years after the effective date, unless terminated early by either party. Either party may terminate the Tulex Master Services Agreement or a Tulex Statement of Work by written notice (1) if the other party is in material breach of the agreement or a Tulex Statement of Work and fails to cure such breach within 15 days after receipt of notice of such breach (or such other time period expressly stated in the applicable Tulex Statement of Work) or (2) in the event of the other party’s insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership, or a failure to remove any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings within ten days from the date of institution of such proceedings.

A termination or expiration of a single Tulex Statement of Work will not cause the automatic termination of the agreement or of any other Tulex Statement of Work.
 
Each party under the Tulex Master Services Agreement agreed to indemnify the other party, its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents against any third-party liabilities arising out of (1) such party’s breach of the Tulex Master Services Agreement or a Tulex Statement of Work or (2) the negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such party, its officers, directors, employees, agents or other representatives in connection with the Tulex Master Services Agreement.

Shah Investor LP Assignment Agreement
 
On August 6, 2013, through Semnur, we entered into an Assignment Agreement (the “Assignment Agreement”) with Shah Investor LP (“Shah Investor”). Mahendra Shah, Ph.D., who served on our board of directors from March 2019 to October 2020, is the managing partner of Shah Investor. Pursuant to the Assignment Agreement, Shah Investor assigned to us certain intellectual property related to pharmaceutical compositions of corticosteroids (the “Assigned IP”). As consideration for the Assigned IP, we agreed to pay a contingent quarterly royalty in the low-single digits to Shah Investor based on the quarterly net sales of any pharmaceutical formulations for local delivery of steroids by injection developed utilizing the Assigned IP (a “Royalty Product”). We expect that SEMDEXA, if approved, will constitute a Royalty Product. The royalty percentage is subject to reduction in certain circumstances. Royalties are due for so long as a Royalty Product is covered by a valid patent in the country of sale or for ten years following the first commercial sale of the first Royalty Product in the United States, whichever is longer. We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to maximize the scope and coverage of the patents contained in the Assigned IP. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no royalty payments have been made as we have not yet commercialized any applicable products and therefore such payments have not been triggered.
 
The Assignment Agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until royalties are no longer due on any Royalty Product. Either party may terminate the Assignment Agreement upon sixty days’ prior written notice, in the event the other party seeks to avoid a provision of the Assignment Agreement by asserting that such provision is invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, unless such assertion is eliminated and the effect of such assertion cured within such sixty day period.

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our novel adhesion and delivery technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio is intended to cover our product candidates, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our novel adhesion and delivery technology, platforms and product candidates.
 
Generally, patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent term can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the PTO in examining the patent application or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, or both. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any patents will adequately protect our product or product candidates.
 
Our patent portfolio, consisting of owned and/or licensed IP as of December 31, 2022 contains approximately sixteen issued and unexpired U.S. patents, six pending U.S. patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application. Our portfolio also includes certain foreign counterparts of these patents and patent applications including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Russian Federation, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Ukraine, and certain countries within the European Patent Convention.
 
With respect to ZTlido and SP-103, our patents and patent applications cover compositions and methods of treatment. With respect to our product candidate SEMDEXA, our patents and patent applications include formulations and methods of treatment. The patents are U.S. Pat. Nos. 10,500,284, 10,117,938, and 11,020,485, all of which expire in 2036. With respect to SP-104, our pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application is WO 2022/076470 (and all patents and patent applications that claim priority rights thereto), which covers oral delayed burst formulations of low-dose naloxone or naltrexone and related methods of treatment. We continue to seek to maximize the scope of our patent protection for all our programs. We have six issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent applications relating to lidocaine topical system compositions and methods of treating pain with lidocaine topical system compositions. The patents are U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,283,174, 9,925,264, 9,931,403, 10,765,749, 10,765,640 and 11,278,623 all of which expire in 2031. Related to GLOPERBA, our licensed patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,907,751, 10,226,423, 10,383,820, and

10,383,821, which relate to liquid colchicine formulations for oral administration and associated methods of use. U.S. Pat. No. 10,226,423 expires in 2037. The remaining patents related to GLOPERBA expire in 2036. We believe that we have certain know-how and trade secrets relating to our technology and product candidates. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology related to our current and future product candidates. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, service providers, and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
 
Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Other Proprietary Information
 
We file trademark applications and pursue registrations in the United States and abroad when appropriate. We own registered U.S. trademarks for the marks “SCILEX,” “ZTlido” and “RESPONSIBLE BY DESIGN.” We also own pending trademark applications for “SEMNUR PHARMACEUTICALS” and “SEMDEXA” in the United States. We also license the GLOPERBA trademark as discussed in relation to the Romeg Agreement described above.
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality and inventions assignment agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. The agreements generally provide that the individual must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any confidential information developed or learned by the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements generally also provide that we will own all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us.
 
SEMDEXA benefits from our substantial intellectual property portfolio and other technical barriers to entry for potential competitors. Further, we are a party to an exclusive supply agreement for a proprietary biocompatible excipient with no generic equivalent. Our complex manufacturing process, specialized equipment and know-how for sterile viscous product candidates are also key to our competitive edge. We believe that our competitors will be required to conduct lengthy and costly preclinical and clinical trials to establish products with comparable safety and efficacy to SEMDEXA.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are marketing and developing. SP-102, SP-103, SP-104 and any other product candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA or otherwise authorized for marketing before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the corresponding foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the FDCA and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the

subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or its products to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as inspection scrutiny, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, or reimbursements, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) covering each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical trials, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA or other marketing application (collectively, an “NDA”), for a proposed new drug, including its specific formulation and labeling;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
 
Before testing novel compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage, also referred to as preclinical studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical studies must comply with federal laws and requirements including GLPs. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns, non-compliance, or for additional reasons. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trial.
 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, subject selection and exclusion criteria, dosing procedures, and the parameters to be used to collect data and to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable statutes, the FDA’s regulations and GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to and signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. In some instances, additional oversight boards, such as a data safety monitoring board, are required to evaluate interim data and determine whether a study should continue or be modified or terminated. Information about many clinical trials is required to be publicly reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov or similar databases.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted only in patients having the specific disease
 •Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease.
 •Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the safety and efficacy of the product for potential approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. In some cases, the FDA may approve a drug based on the results of a single adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 trial for excellent design and which provided highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of important clinical benefit.
 
Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.
 
Progress reports detailing the status of drug development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected (including increased rate of occurrence of such adverse reactions), findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug, or any findings from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not yield positive results, or may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds,

including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects.
 
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
FDA Review and Approval Processes
 
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for the claimed indications are incorporated into an NDA. The FDA may grant deferrals for the development and submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers after the initial submission of a pediatric study plan following an end of Phase 2 meeting. In addition, descriptions of the manufacturing process and controls, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are also submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees and a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 
The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard, original NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed,

the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.

After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA administers a number of different programs that enable the agency and sponsors in various ways to expedite the development or agency review of a new drug product. Among these, the FDA has a fast track designation that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. New drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. As an example of the modified processes available to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to

review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of other NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform additional adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-use submission of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek the FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work with the sponsor to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 With passage of the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with the FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints.
 
We have obtained fast track designation for SEMDEXA for the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain and have applied for breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of lumbosacral radicular pain based on the top-line results obtained from the pivotal Phase 3 trial, which results reflect achievement of primary and secondary endpoints. We have also obtained fast track designation for SP-103 for the treatment of acute LBP. We may seek additional designations for SEMDEXA, SP-103 or our other product candidates. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 

Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown risks or problems with a product may result in labeling changes, restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences or quality issues with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, satisfaction of post-approval requirements or commitments, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses, or in patient populations, that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling, which is known as “off-label use,” rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with post-approval requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant, manufacturer or product to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
 
Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of NDAs that may be submitted to request marketing authorization for a new drug, the first being a 505(b)(1) NDA. A 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. A 505(b)(2) NDA likewise contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness relevant to a product, but some of the data are not owned by or licensed to the applicant. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for generic versions of approved drug products through the submission of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”). An ANDA generally provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form, and with the same labeling and route of administration as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. ANDA applicants are required to conduct bioequivalence testing to confirm chemical and therapeutic equivalence to the branded reference drug. Generic versions of drugs can often, and sometimes must, be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the branded reference drug.
 

A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Additional preclinical and clinical data may also be submitted. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, or for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.

Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA at least one of the following (1) no patent information on the drug product that is relied upon by the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA (known as the reference drug) has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV Certification. If the NDA holder for the reference drug or patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the Paragraph IV Certification, the FDA may not approve that application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the Paragraph IV Certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s or patent owner’s decision to initiate patent litigation.
 
In addition to, and distinct from the patent protection provisions, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments establish periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing a new chemical entity that has not been previously approved by the FDA. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA approval of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs that include the innovation that required the new clinical data, but generally allows the approval for non-protected characteristics and labeling.
 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA for the drug for the rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan

exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication not protected by the exclusive approval, but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. The FDA also has authority to withdraw exclusive marketing rights if the holder of an approved orphan drug cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug within a reasonable time to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Once withdrawn under such circumstances, exclusive approval may not be reinstated for that drug.
 
Third-Party Payor Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, sales of a product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the product. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication, and which can change over time. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs, in order for the company’s products to be considered as a formulary option. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered by individual payors to be medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that a preferred formulary position or an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our products and the product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results. See the discussion below under “U.S. Healthcare Reform”, and regarding the Inflation Reduction Act for further information.
 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Economic Area (F”) (which is currently comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national

healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some countries in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) operate positive and negative list systems under which some medicinal products are selected for coverage (positive list) and others are explicitly listed as excluded from reimbursement (negative list). To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these EEA countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other EEA countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. The pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2020 (the “ACA”) was enacted, which is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms, and which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, (1) subjected therapeutic biologics to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars by creating a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products, (2) prescribed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, (3) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, (4) established annual nondeductible fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, (5) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D, (6) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, (7) expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Public Health Service Act program, (8) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research, and (9) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and Administrative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, legislation affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA has been signed into law. The TCJA included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred

to as the “individual mandate”. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owned by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law, which, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The Inflation Reduction Act also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost through a newly established manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how additional healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to modify or invalidate the ACA or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will impact our business. Any health care reform measures will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or other policy or the impact of potential legislation or other policy on us.
 
Other legislative and administrative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted to reduce healthcare expenditures. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, in connection with subsequent legislation, reduced Medicare payments to providers, on average, by 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020, through May 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. Moreover, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. If federal spending is further reduced, anticipated budgetary shortfalls may impact the ability of relevant agencies to continue to function at current levels. Amounts allocated to federal grants and contracts may be reduced or eliminated. These reductions may also impact the ability of relevant agencies to timely review and approve research and development, manufacturing, and marketing activities, which may delay our ability to develop, market and sell any products we may develop.
 
Recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. On May 16, 2019, CMS adopted a final rule that, among other things, will require Part D plans to adopt Real Time Benefit Tools that are capable of integrating with electronic prescribing or electronic health record systems and have the capability to inform prescribers when lower-cost alternative therapies are available under a beneficiary’s prescription drug benefit. Similarly, since 2021, Part D Explanation of Benefits transmittals to members

are required to inform Part D beneficiaries about drug prices and lower cost therapeutic alternatives. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which among other things, contains two specific provisions affecting pricing for drugs and biologics. The first provision allows for CMS to negotiate prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D, beginning with ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. The legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also caps Medicare beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket drug expenses at $2,000. The second provision imposes a requirement that pharma manufacturers provide a rebate to Medicare, if the manufacturer increases price at a rate higher than the measured inflation rate. Medicaid has had a rebate program for several years, but Medicare did not. The intent is to limit price increases. The new rebate applies to drugs covered by Medicare under Part B or Part D . The rebate obligation applies if the average sales price (for Part B) or average manufacturers price (for Part D) of a single source drug or biologic increases more than the rate of inflation (as measured by the index for urban consumers). The rebate amount is the total number of units sold in Medicare coverage multiplied by the amount by which the price exceeds the inflation adjusted price. The base year against which the inflation adjustment is measured is 2021. If the price exceeds the inflation adjusted price, the difference is multiplied by the units sold in Medicare and that amount is to be rebated. A failure to pay the rebate is subject to a penalty of 125% of the original rebate amount. The provision for Part D takes effect in 2022, with rebates to be paid beginning in 2023. The provision for Part B takes effect in 2023. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. In some cases, states appear interested in public policy designed to encourage drug importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third-party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 
We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product.
 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope.
 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person, including a pharmaceutical manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The term “remuneration” is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors.
 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds, or knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids, or decreases an obligation to pay money to the government. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance.
 
The healthcare fraud provisions under the U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”) impose criminal liability for, among other things, knowingly and

willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private third-party payors, or falsifying or covering up a material fact or making any materially false or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation promulgated by both the U.S. federal government and the U.S. states in which we conduct our business. For example, under HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services imposes upon “covered entities” (broadly, healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and their respective “business associates” (individuals or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information on behalf of a covered entity) privacy obligations; requirements to implement appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information; and breach response notification obligations. We are not subject to HIPAA, as we are neither a covered entity nor business associate. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) also requires companies to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure and to make accurate statements regarding how they secure personal information under their custody or control, such as in a privacy notice. The FTC also expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of personal information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve data security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information, which we process, is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. Violations of the foregoing FTC requirements may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices under Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). While we do not intend to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the FTC has the power to enforce public privacy statements as it interprets them. Further, events that we cannot fully control, such as data breaches, may also result in civil penalties, FTC enforcement or enforcement by U.S. state attorneys general or other regulators. . Various U.S. states have implemented privacy laws and regulations that regulate the use and disclosure of health information and other personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations (the “CCPA”), established a privacy framework for covered businesses by, among other items, expanding the definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers that are resident in the State of California, imposing rules on the collection of personal information from minors, and creating a statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA, including for failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Penalties for violations of the CCPA include civil penalties and may result in related legal claims. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), most provisions of which became operative on January 1, 2023, introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (the “CPPA”). Similarly, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act took effect on January 1, 2023; the Colorado Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023; the Utah Consumer Privacy Act will take effect on December 31, 2023; and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act will take effect on July 1, 2023. The foregoing U.S. state privacy laws impose many similar obligations as the CCPA on our processing of personal information. Other U.S. states are considering similar privacy legislation, and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas. The uncertainty, ambiguity, complexity, and potential inconsistency surrounding the implementation and interpretation of the CCPA and other enacted or forthcoming U.S. state privacy laws exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to the privacy, security and confidentiality of personal information and protected health information. We may be subject to fines, penalties, or private actions in the event of non-compliance with such laws.
 
Our activities outside of the U.S. implicate local, state, provincial, and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. Such laws may also restrict the access, use and disclosure of patient health information abroad. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws, to protect against security breaches and hackers, or to remediate issues caused by such breaches. Compliance with

these laws is challenging, constantly evolving, time consuming, and requires a flexible privacy framework and substantial resources. Compliance efforts will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.
 
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition to this federal requirement, a number of individual states and foreign jurisdictions require detailed reporting and often public disclosures concerning transfers of value to physicians, other health care providers and family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations are extended to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
 
Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
 
Where our activities involve foreign government officials, they may also potentially be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). If we seek to have a product paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid programs or Medicare Part B, various obligations, including government price reporting, are required under the Medicaid rebate provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended, which generally require products to be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to such programs and certain purchasers. Government price reporting may also be required with respect to average sales price, which serves as the basis of reimbursement under Medicare Part B. In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of

products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
 
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity
 
Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. This definition is currently under FDA review. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, such as new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 
Pediatric Exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to any existing exclusivity period or patent term. This six-month exclusivity may be granted by the FDA based on the completion of a pediatric clinical trial in accordance with provisions of the FDCA.
 
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement, anti-bribery, advertising and promotion, data privacy and security and any commercial sales and distribution of our future products.
 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.
 

In the EEA, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (the “Clinical Trials Directive”) and the related national implementing provisions of the relevant individual EEA country’s requirements, the clinical trial described in that CTA may proceed.
 
In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (the “Clinical Trials Regulation”) was adopted. The Clinical Trials Regulation entered into force on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all the EEA countries, repealing the prior Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation allows a sponsor to start and conduct a clinical trial in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive during a transitional period of one year after the application date, i.e. January 31, 2022. The transition period for the trials ongoing at the moment of applicability will be a maximum of 3 years after the date of application of the Clinical Trials Regulation. Clinical trials authorized under the current Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. An application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new Clinical Trials Regulation will need to be submitted and authorized in time before the end of the transitional period. The new Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EEA. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided into two parts.
 
For other countries outside of the EEA, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
In the EEA, medicinal products can be commercialized only after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). There are several procedures for requesting marketing authorization which can be more efficient than applying for authorization on a country-by-country basis. There is a “centralized” procedure allowing submission of a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”). If the EMA issues a positive opinion, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EEA countries.
 
The “centralized” procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The “centralized” procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EEA.
 
There is also a “decentralized” procedure allowing companies to file identical applications to several EEA countries simultaneously for product candidates that have not yet been authorized in any EEA country and a “mutual recognition” procedure allowing companies that have a product already authorized in one EEA country to apply for that authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EEA countries. Under the “decentralized” procedure, an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the EEA countries in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other EEA countries do not raise objections, the product is authorized in all the EEA countries where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the

EEA countries make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
In many countries outside the United States, procedures to obtain price approvals, coverage and reimbursement can take considerable time after the receipt of a MA. Many EEA countries periodically review their reimbursement of medicinal products, which could have an adverse impact on reimbursement status. In addition, we expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EEA countries will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative to branded products, and/or branded products available through parallel import to keep healthcare costs down. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some EEA countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EEA countries, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process, which is currently governed by national laws in each EEA country, is the procedure to assess therapeutic, economic and societal impact of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. The outcome of an HTA will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EEA countries. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between EEA countries, although the HTA Regulation, which aims to harmonize the clinical benefit assessment of HTA across the EEA, will apply from January 12, 2025. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement status in EEA countries that represent significant markets, our anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for our products in the EEA could be negatively affected.
 
Outside the United States, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of EEA countries, national sunshine rules, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of our products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EEA. Other applicable laws at the EEA level and in the individual EU Member States also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and to health care professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EEA could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment.
 
In addition to data privacy and security regulations in the United States, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulations in the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (“UK”), where the legislative and regulatory landscape continues to evolve. There has been increased regulator attention to privacy and data security issues that could potentially affect our business, including through legislation such as the EEA General Data Protection Regulation (“EEA GDPR”) and UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR,” and together, the “GDPR”), which each imposes strict obligations on the processing of personal data, including the transfer of personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, or UK to third countries that the European Commission has determined does not ensure an adequate level of protection, such as the United States. If we violate

the GDPR, we may face significant penalties of up to EUR 10,000,000 or 2% of our total worldwide annual, or for more serious violations, up to EUR 20,000,000 or 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover.
 
The GDPR and other EEA and UK data privacy and security regulations generally restrict the transfer of personal data from the EEA, United Kingdom and Switzerland, to the United States and certain other third countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal data. One of the primary safeguards on which companies may rely to import or export personal data from had been the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) in a case known as “Schrems II.” Following this decision, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (the “FDPIC”) announced that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield does not provide adequate safeguards for the purposes of personal data transfers from Switzerland to third countries that are deemed as not providing adequate protection, including the United States. While the FDPIC does not have authority to invalidate the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield regime, the FDPIC’s announcement casts doubt on the viability of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as a compliance mechanism for Swiss-U.S. data transfers.

The CJEU’s decision in Schrems II also raised questions about whether one of the primary alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, namely the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, can lawfully be used for personal data transfers from Europe to the United States or other third countries that are not the subject of an adequacy decision of the European Commission. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the Standard Contractual Clauses in principle in Schrems II, it made clear that reliance on the Standard Contractual Clauses alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the Standard Contractual Clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular regarding applicable surveillance laws and relevant rights of individuals with respect to the transferred data. In the context of any given transfer, where the legal regime applicable in the destination country may or does conflict with the intended operation of the Standard Contractual Clauses and/or applicable European law, the decision in Schrems II and subsequent draft guidance from the European Data Protection Board (the “EDPB”) would require the parties to that transfer to implement certain supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures to rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses as a lawful “transfer mechanism.” However, the draft guidance from the EDPB on such supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures appears to conclude that any combination of such measures may not be sufficient to allow effective reliance on the Standard Contractual Clauses in the context of transfers of personal data “in the clear” to recipients in countries where the power granted to public authorities to access the transferred data goes beyond that which is “necessary and proportionate in a democratic society” - which may, following the CJEU’s conclusions in Schrems II on relevant powers of United States public authorities and commentary in draft EDPB guidance, include the United States in certain circumstances (e.g., where Section 702 of the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applies). Further, the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) has provided for separate international data transfer mechanisms for restricted transfers of data from the UK: an international data transfer agreement (the UK equivalent of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses) (“IDTA”) and an international data transfer addendum (which amends the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for purposes of international data transfers from the UK to countries without an essentially equivalent data protection framework) (the “Addendum”). Both the IDTA and the Addendum came into force in March 2022.
 
If we are unable to implement a valid solution to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States or other countries that have not been deemed to provide an essentially equivalent level of data protection, we may face increased exposure to regulatory action, substantial fines, or injunction orders to stop processing personal data from EEA, Swiss, or UK residents. Any inability to import personal data to the United States may also restrict our clinical trials activities in the EU; limit our ability to collaborate with contract research organizations as well as other service

providers, contractors and other companies subject to EU data privacy and security laws; and require us to increase our data processing capabilities in the EU and the UK at significant expense. Additionally, other countries outside of the EU have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, which could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business. The types of challenges we face in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK will likely also arise in other jurisdictions that adopt laws similar to the GDPR or regulatory frameworks of equivalent complexity.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions or criminal prosecution.
 
Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 90 full-time employees, including five employees who have M.D.s or Ph.D.s. Within our workforce, seven employees were primarily engaged in research and development, 70 were primarily engaged in sales and marketing and 13 were primarily engaged in general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relationships with our employees.
 We focus on identifying, attracting, incentivizing, developing and retaining an exceptional team of highly talented and motivated employees to support our current product pipeline and future business goals. In order to drive innovation, we continuously improve our human capital management strategies and find ways to foster engagement and growth within our company.
 
We regularly benchmark total rewards we provide against our industry peers to ensure we offer competitive compensation and benefits packages to our employees and potential new hires. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward selected personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, as well as provide our employees with the opportunity to participate in our employee stock purchase plan, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We strive to build a diverse environment where our employees can thrive and one that inspires exceptional contributions and professional and personal development in order to achieve our vision to become the leading pain management company that can have a transformative impact on patients’ lives. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive action from the earliest signs of the COVID-19 outbreak, which included implementing social distancing policies at our facilities, facilitating remote working arrangements, requiring proof of vaccination or acceptable exemption, and imposing employee travel restrictions.
 
We plan to continue to develop our efforts related to attracting, retaining and motivating our workforce as we grow and develop.


Legal Proceedings

From time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including those that may arise in the ordinary course of business.

Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Hisamitsu America, Inc. Litigation

On February 23, 2021, we filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Hisamitsu America, Inc., two manufacturers of OTC lidocaine patch products, alleging, among other things, false and deceptive advertising and unfair competition under the Lanham Act and California state laws by those companies regarding their respective OTC patch products (the “Sanofi-Aventis & Hisamitsu Litigation”). This lawsuit seeks, among other relief, damages and an injunction enjoining the defendants from continuing to make false or misleading statements of fact about their respective OTC lidocaine patch products. The defendants have filed motions to dismiss, which have narrowed slightly our claims, but which motions the court has largely rejected. Discovery is proceeding. The case is currently scheduled for trial to begin on July 24, 2023. We cannot make any predictions about the outcome in this matter or the timing thereof.
Former Employee Litigation

On March 12, 2021, we filed an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Anthony Mack, former President of Scilex Pharma, and Virpax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Virpax”), a company now headed by Mr. Mack, alleging, among other things, breach by Mr. Mack of his non-compete agreement with us, breach of fiduciary duty, and tortious interference by Virpax with that non-compete agreement (the “Former Employee Litigation”). This lawsuit seeks, among other relief, damages and an injunction enjoining Mr. Mack from further violating his non-compete agreement and enjoining Virpax from tortiously interfering with Mr. Mack’s non-compete agreement. The case was tried from September 12, 2022 to September 14, 2022. Post-trial briefing and closing arguments have been concluded and the case is under submission to the Court. We cannot make any predictions about the outcome in this matter or the timing thereof.
ZTlido Patent Litigation

On June 22, 2022, we filed a complaint against Aveva Drug Delivery Systems, Inc., Apotex Corp., and Apotex, Inc. (together, “Apotex”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “ZTlido Patent Litigation”) alleging infringement of certain Orange Book listed patents covering ZTlido (the “ZTlido Patents”). The ZTlido Patent Litigation was initiated following the submission by Apotex, in accordance with the procedures set out in the Hatch-Waxman Act, of an ANDA. Apotex’s ANDA seeks approval to market a generic version of ZTlido prior to the expiration of the ZTlido Patents and alleges that the ZTlido Patents are invalid, unenforceable, and/or not infringed. We are seeking, among other relief, an order that the effective date of any FDA approval of Apotex’s ANDA be no earlier than the expiration of the asserted patents listed in the Orange Book, the latest of which expires on May 10, 2031, and such further and other relief as the court may deem appropriate. Apotex is subject to a 30-month stay preventing it from selling a generic version of ZTlido during that time. The stay should expire no earlier than November 11, 2024. Trial in the ZTlido Patent Litigation has not yet been scheduled. We cannot make any predictions about the final outcome of this matter or the timing thereof.
Our Corporate History
 
Legacy Scilex was incorporated in Delaware in February 2019 for the purpose of effecting a corporate reorganization. On March 18, 2019, Legacy Scilex entered into a Contribution and Loan Agreement with Sorrento and the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Scilex Pharma pursuant to which Legacy Scilex acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Scilex Pharma in exchange for shares of Legacy Scilex Common Stock (such transaction, the “Contribution”). Pursuant to the Contribution and Loan Agreement, Sorrento provided Legacy Scilex with a loan with an initial principal amount of $16.5 million in the form of a note payable, which loan was used to fund the acquisition of Semnur. Concurrently therewith, Legacy Scilex entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Semnur, Sigma Merger Sub, Inc., Legacy Scilex’s prior wholly owned subsidiary, Fortis Advisors LLC, solely as representative of the holders of Semnur equity, and Sorrento, for limited purposes (as amended, the “Semnur Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Semnur Merger Agreement, Sigma Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Semnur (such transaction, the “Semnur Merger”), with Semnur surviving the Semnur Merger as Legacy Scilex’s wholly owned subsidiary. As a result of the Contribution and the Semnur Merger, Scilex Pharma and Semnur became Legacy Scilex’s wholly owned subsidiaries. Prior to the Contribution and the Semnur Merger, operations of Legacy Scilex were conducted through Scilex Pharma, which was formed in September 2012. Semnur was formed in June 2013.
