Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (the “Company” or “Cocrystal”) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to discover and develop novel antiviral therapeutics as treatments for serious and/or chronic viral diseases. We employ unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize winning expertise to create first- and best-in-class antiviral drugs. These technologies are designed to efficiently deliver small molecule therapeutics that are safe, effective, and convenient to administer. We have identified promising discovery, preclinical and clinical stage antiviral compounds for unmet medical needs caused by coronavirus, influenza virus, norovirus, and hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) infections.
 
The Company operates in one segment. Management uses cash flows as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making.
 
Cocrystal Technology
 
We are developing antiviral therapeutics that inhibit the essential viral replication function of RNA viruses causing acute and chronic viral diseases. Our goals include treating influenza virus, coronavirus, and norovirus infections by discovering and developing drug candidates targeting the viral replication process. Additionally, one of our goals is to decrease the duration of HCV therapy by advancing our drug candidate targeting the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme through partnerships and/or licensing activities. In the case of coronavirus antiviral therapeutics, we target replication enzymes and proteases that are required for the viral replication and transcription. To discover and design these inhibitors, we use a proprietary platform comprising computational chemistry, medicinal chemistry, X-ray crystallography and our extensive know-how. We determine the structures of cocrystals containing the inhibitors bound to the enzyme or protein to guide our structure-based drug design. We also use advanced computational methods to screen and design product candidates using proprietary cocrystal structural information. In designing the candidates, we seek to anticipate and avert potential viral mutations leading to resistance. By designing and selecting drug candidates that interrupt the viral replication process and also have specific binding characteristics, we seek to develop drugs that are not only effective against both the virus and possible mutants of the virus, but which also have reduced off-target interactions that may cause undesirable clinical side effects. The successful application of our approach requires an extensive knowledge of viruses and drug targets. In addition, knowledge and experience in the fields of structural biology, and enzymology are required. We developed our proprietary structure-based drug design under the guidance of Dr. Roger Kornberg, our Chief Scientist and Chairman of both our Scientific Advisory Board and Board of Directors (the “Board”), in addition to a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006. Our drug discovery process focuses on the highly conserved regions of the viral enzymes and inhibitor-enzyme interactions at the atomic level. Additionally, we have developed proprietary chemical libraries consisting of non-nucleoside inhibitors, metal-binding inhibitors, and drug-like fragments. Our drug discovery process is different from traditional, empirical, medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative high-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes. We will continue developing preclinical and clinical drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technology.
 
The Company’s proprietary technology integrates several powerful and specialized techniques:
 

(1) | Selection of viral drug targets amenable to broad-spectrum antiviral drug development and essential for viral genome replication; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Atomic resolution 3-D structure determination of drug binding pockets; 
(3) | In-depth computational analysis of conservation of drug-binding pockets and critical molecular interactions between antiviral inhibitors and amino acid residues of the target molecule’s drug-binding pocket; 
(4) | Cocrystal structure determinations to inform hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization processes;

-


(5) | Molecular modeling and computer-guided lead discovery to support rational chemical modifications based on structure-activity relationships, or SAR, of candidate inhibitor compounds; 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(6) | Knowledge of enzymatic mechanisms to guide the design of drugs with exceptional affinity, specificity, and broad-spectrum activity; and 
(7) | Platforms for rapid identification of antiviral enzyme inhibitors showing broad-spectrum antiviral activity. 

 
We have applied these techniques to develop antiviral inhibitors of four important viruses: influenza virus, coronavirus, norovirus and HCV.
 
Market-Driven Product Profiles
 
In all of our programs our goal is to develop best-in-class broad-spectrum antiviral drugs with high-barrier-to-drug resistance. An ideal product for an antiviral therapy would have at least the following characteristics:

(1) | High barrier to viral resistance; 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) | Effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease; 
(3) | Fast onset of action and/or shortened therapeutic time; 
(4) | Good safety and tolerability profile; and 
(5) | Multiple routes of administration including oral, inhalation, and/or injection. 

 
Even at the discovery stage of drug development, we select compounds with these factors in mind. Furthermore, we believe our technology is capable of delivering therapies that satisfy all of these key factors, as detailed below.
 
High barrier to drug resistance: Drug resistance is a major obstacle to developing effective antiviral therapies. Viruses can reproduce rapidly and in enormous quantities in infected human cells. During viral replication, random changes in the viral genome, called mutations, develop. If such a mutation occurs in a region of the viral genome that is targeted by a given antiviral therapy, that therapy may no longer be effective against the mutated virus. These mutated or “resistant” viruses can freely infect and multiply even in individuals who have received drug treatment. In some cases, resistant virus strains may even predominate. For example, in the 2009 swine influenza pandemic, the predominant strain was resistant to the best available therapies. In the COVID-19 pandemic mutated viruses have been identified and sequenced demonstrating that the potential for resistance to current drugs and reduced effectiveness of vaccines is already present. For example, the Omicron variant which arose as the dominant strain of COVID-19 in late 2021 until it diminished in the winter of 2022 displayed increased resistance to available vaccines and treatments, resulting in the limitation or suspension of emergency use authorizations by the FDA for certain therapeutic products.
 
The Company’s focus on viral replication proteins can overcome the obstacle of viral resistance. We identify and target critical components of viral replication proteins that are essential for function, and therefore, sensitive to change. A mutation in these critical components is likely to inactivate the replication protein and, in turn, render the virus incapable of replicating. Because such mutations cannot propagate, the virus cannot effectively develop resistance to the enzyme inhibitors we employ. We test the effectiveness of our compounds against potential viral mutations and select compounds with the highest barrier to resistance.
 
Broadly effective against major strains responsible for a viral disease: For any given viral disease, there are different strains of viruses that cause the disease. For example, there are three types of influenza viruses, A, B, and C. Influenza A and B viruses are significant human respiratory pathogens that cause seasonal flu. Influenza A viruses can also cause an influenza pandemic. Influenza C is a subtype of the influenza virus that tends to cause only mild illness and is not responsible for seasonal or pandemic infections. Our goal is to design and develop drug candidates that will be effective on the broadest possible range of viruses causing the disease.

Many antiviral drugs available today are effective only against certain strains of a given virus and less effective or not effective at all against other strains. To address this problem, we are developing drug candidates that specifically target viral proteins involved in viral replication. Despite the various strains of virus that may exist, these enzymes required for viral replication are essentially similar (highly conserved) among all strains of a given virus. By targeting these highly conserved regions of the replication enzymes, our antiviral compounds are designed and tested to be effective against major virus strains. Replication enzymes are generally conserved not only among subtypes of a given virus but also among many different viruses, creating an opportunity for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.
 
Fast onset of action: As viruses can reproduce rapidly and in enormous quantities in human cells, antiviral drugs are needed with faster onset of viral load reduction resulting in shorter treatment time.
 
Safety and tolerability: All drugs have side effects, also referred to as adverse effects. These usually result from a drug’s ability to bind to human molecules (usually proteins). When this interaction is intentional (i.e., part of the drug’s mechanism of action), the adverse effects are classified as on-target effects. When this interaction is unintentional (i.e., resulting from the drug’s interaction with an unintended human molecule), the effects are called off-target effects. Our inhibitors target viral replication enzymes, which are generally unique to viruses. Because the targets are viral, not human, minimal adverse effects may be the result. During the discovery phase, we evaluate candidate compounds for potential cross-reactivity with human replication enzymes and attempt to eliminate those compounds that are cross-reactive with human homologous proteins. In December 2022, we reported favorable safety and tolerability results from a Phase 1 study of our oral antiviral CC-42344 developed for the treatment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza A.
 
Ease of administration: We select compounds for development that can be administered orally, preferably once daily in pill-form, or by inhalation or injection.
 
Research and Development Update
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company focused its research and development efforts primarily in three areas:
 
Influenza infections
 
We have several candidates under development for the treatment of influenza infection. CC-42344, a novel oral PB2 inhibitor, was selected as a preclinical lead for the treatment of pandemic and seasonal influenza A, and was advanced to a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2022 as described in more detail below. This candidate binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 showed excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu resistant strains, and has favorable pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles.
 
In March 2022 enrollment was initiated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CC-42344, which was conducted in Australia. In April 2022 we announced preliminary results from the first two cohorts of the single-ascending dose portion of the study in which CC-42344 demonstrated a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile. In December 2022, we reported favorable safety and tolerability results from a Phase 1 study of CC-42344 for the treatment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza A.
 
In addition, novel inhibitors effective against both influenza strains A and B have been identified and are in the preclinical stage. Several of these have potencies approaching single-digit nanomolar. On January 2, 2019, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (“Merck”) to discover and develop certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents. See “Item 1 – Business – Collaborations – Merck Collaboration” for more information.
 
In January 2021, we announced that we completed all research obligations under the Merck exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement, and that Merck would be solely responsible for further development of the influenza A/B antiviral compounds that were discovered using Cocrystal’s unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize-winning expertise. Merck is continuing development of the influenza A/B antiviral compounds under the terms of our Collaboration Agreement and is legally protecting the intellectual property of the collaboration compounds.

Coronavirus infections
 
In October 2022 we announced the selection of a novel, broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidate CDI-988 for clinical development as an oral treatment for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. CDI-988 targets a highly conserved region in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main (3CL) protease required for viral replication and was specifically designed and developed as an oral antiviral candidate for COVID-19 using Cocrystal’s proprietary structure-based drug discovery platform technology.
 
In January 2022 we announced the selection of two investigational novel antiviral drug candidates, CDI-988 and CDI-873, for further development as oral treatments for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Both compounds exhibited superior in vitro potency against SARS-CoV-2 with activity maintained against recent variants of concern. In preclinical studies, both candidates demonstrated a favorable safety profile and pharmacokinetic properties supportive of daily oral dosing. We plan to begin a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study of CDI-988 during the first half of 2023.
 
In December 2020 we announced the selection of CDI-45205 for further development against coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19. CDI-45205 was one of the broad-spectrum protease inhibitors that were obtained from Kansas State University Research Foundation (“KSURF”) under an exclusive license agreement announced in April 2020. That agreement provides Cocrystal with an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic products against coronaviruses, caliciviruses and picornaviruses based on antivirals discovered by KSURF. See “Collaborations – Kansas State University Research Foundation.”
 
Norovirus Infections
 
We continue to identify and develop non-nucleoside polymerase and protease inhibitors using the Company’s proprietary structure-based drug design technology platform. In addition, we now have exclusive rights to norovirus protease inhibitors for use in humans obtained in the license from KSURF (see under Collaborations below). We expect to select a preclinical lead in the first half of 2023.
Therapeutic Targets
 
Influenza: A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease.
 
Influenza is a severe respiratory illness, caused primarily by influenza A or B virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) estimates that influenza was linked to approximately 79,000 deaths and 960,000 hospitalizations in the United States during the 2017-2018 flu season. According to the report published by BCC Research in May 2018, the global influenza market was valued at approximately $5.6 billion in 2017 and was expected to reach nearly $6.5 billion by 2022, increasing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.0% from 2017 through 2022.
 
Currently, approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective, but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus that are resistant to the approved treatments osteltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®) and zanamavir (Relenza®), baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®) have appeared, and in some cases predominated. For example, the predominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant to Tamiflu. These drugs target viral neuraminidase enzymes, which are not highly conserved between viral strains. In fact, different influenza virus strains such as H1N1 and H5N1 are named according to their respective differences in hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).

The Company selected CC-42344, a novel PB2 inhibitor, as a lead candidate and has clinically completed a Phase 1 study. In December 2022, the Company reported on the favorable safety and tolerability results of the CC-42344 Phase 1 study and plan to initiate a Phase 2a study in the first half of 2023. CC-42344 binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of the influenza polymerase (PB1: PB2: PA), and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 has shown excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains, and Tamiflu-resistant, Xofluza-resistant strains, and has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. In addition to Tamiflu, an approved antiviral product candidate that is a competitor for the Company’s influenza programs, S-033188, being developed by Shionogi/Roche. S-033188 was approved as Xofluza in Japan on February 23, 2018, and in the US as baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®) on October 24, 2018. See “Item 1 – Business – Research and Development Update – Influenza” for more information. Xofluza-resistant strains emerged in both the US and Japan within several months of Xofluza being on the market.
 
Coronavirus: COVID-19 continues to be a global pandemic fueled by an emergence of new strains.
 
As a global pandemic with 760,360,956 COVID-19 confirmed cases globally, including 6,873,477 deaths, as of March 16, 2023, according to the data reported by the World Health Organization (“WHO”). The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the federal, state and foreign governments to stop the spread of the virus have caused a significant disruption to the U.S. and global economy.
 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA viruses that historically have been associated with illness ranging from mild symptoms similar to the common cold to more severe respiratory disease. Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a wide range of responses, from no symptoms to more severe disease that has included pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be within 14 days after exposure, with most illness occurring within about 5 days after exposure. SARS-CoV-2, like other RNA viruses, is prone to mutate over time, resulting in the emergence of multiple variants. Adaptive mutations in the viral genome can alter the virus’s pathogenic potential. Even a single amino acid exchange can drastically affect a virus’s ability to evade the immune system and complicate the vaccine and antibody therapeutics development against the virus. Based on the recent epidemiological update by the WHO, five SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (variants of concern) have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic. Also, as demonstrated in Delta and Omicron variants, some variations allow the virus to spread more easily and make it resistant to the treatments and vaccines.
 
On October 22, 2020, FDA approved the antiviral drug Veklury (remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that inhibits viral replication and was previously evaluated in clinical trials for Ebola treatment in 2014. In addition to Veklury, the FDA has issued emergency authorization use on several antibody and antiviral therapeutics, including Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir and ritonavir) and Lagevrio (molpiravir). We continue pursuing the development of novel antiviral compounds for the treatment of coronavirus infections using our established proprietary drug discovery platform. By targeting the viral replication enzymes and protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all coronavirus diseases including COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) - coronaviruses.
 
Hepatitis C: A large competitive market with opportunity for shorter treatment regimens.
 
HCV is a highly competitive and changing market. Currently, the standard treatment varies with the genotype of the HCV infection. Prior to late 2013, treatment included peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, along with a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir). In late 2013, sofosbuvir, a drug belonging to a new class of drugs called “nucleoside analogs” or “Nucs,” was approved to treat HCV. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (the most common HCV genotype in the US), sofosbuvir was administered in combination with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. In patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, however, sofosbuvir could be effectively administered in combination with ribavirin, without the need for peginterferon alpha. Since 2014, several new combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (“DAAs”) have been approved for the treatment of HCV infection. These include Harvoni (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Viekira Pak (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Epclusa (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) 12 weeks of treatment, Zepatier (elbasvir/grazoprevir) 12 weeks of treatment and Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) 8 weeks of treatment. We believe the next improvements in HCV treatment will be ultra-short combination oral treatments of four to six weeks, the goal of our program.
 
We anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2036, given the large prevalence of HCV infection worldwide. The 2017 World Health Organization Global Hepatitis Report estimates that 71 million people worldwide have chronic HCV infections.

We are targeting the viral NS5B polymerase with an NNI, which could be developed as part of an all-oral, pan-genotypic combination regimen. Our focus is on developing what is now called ultrashort treatment regimens from 4 to 6 weeks in length. Such a combination treatment CC-31244 with different classes of approved DAAs has the potential to change the paradigm of treatment for HCV with a shorter duration of treatment. Combination strategies with approved drugs could allow us to expand CC-31244 into the HCV antiviral therapeutic area globally and could lead to a high and fast cure rate, to improved compliance, and to reduced treatment duration. To our knowledge no competing company has yet developed a short HCV treatment of less than 8 weeks with a high (>95%) sustained virologic response (SVR) at week 12.
 
CC-31244, an HCV NNI, is a potential best in class pan-genotypic inhibitor of NS5B polymerase for the treatment of HCV. The Company completed a Phase 1a/b study in Canada in September 2016, with favorable safety results in a randomized, double-blinded, Phase 1a/b study in healthy volunteers and HCV-infected subjects. The Company completed a Phase 2a study in HCV genotype 1 subjects in the United States. Cocrystal presented the interim results from the Phase1a/b study at the APASL in February 2017. HCV-infected subjects treated with CC-31244 had a rapid and marked decline in HCV RNA levels, and slow viral rebound after treatment. Results of this study suggest that CC-31244 could be an important component in a shortened duration all-oral HCV combination therapy. Patient enrollment has been completed in the Phase 2b and the final study report filed with the FDA. See “Item 1 – Business – Research and Development Update – Hepatitis C” for more information.
 
The Company has been seeking a partner for further clinical development of CC-31244 since completing Phase 2a trials.
 
Norovirus: A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90% of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world.
 
Norovirus is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms include fatigue, fever and dehydration. Noroviruses are a major cause of gastrointestinal illness in closed and crowded environments, having become notorious for their common occurrence in hospitals, nursing homes, childcare facilities, and cruise ships. In the United States alone, noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and are estimated to cause 19-21 million illnesses each year and contribute to 109,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world. In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus infection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. A few companies have been developing antiviral treatments for this disease and four candidate vaccines are in stages of clinical testing by Vaxart Pharmaceutical, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical (China) and National Vaccine and Serum Institute (China).
 
By targeting viral replication enzymes and a viral protease, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups of norovirus. Also, because of the significant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals, new antiviral therapeutic approaches may warrant an accelerated path to market. The Company is developing inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and protease of norovirus. Similar to the HCV polymerases, these enzymes are essential to viral replication and are highly conserved between all noroviral genogroups. Therefore, an inhibitor of these enzymes might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic agent, when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example. We have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase and protease crystals and have identified promising inhibitors. We are implementing the platform and approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs.

Collaborations
 
Merck Collaboration
 
On January 2, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with Merck to discover and develop certain proprietary influenza A/B antiviral agents.
 
Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Merck is funding research and development for the program at Cocrystal and Merck, including clinical development at Merck, protecting intellectual property and Merck is responsible for worldwide commercialization of any products derived from the collaboration. The Company received an upfront payment of $4,000,000 in January 2019 and is eligible to receive milestone payments related to designated development, regulatory and sales milestones with the potential to earn up to $156,000,000, as well as royalties on product sales. Other than the initial upfront payment, to date we have not received any payments under this Collaboration Agreement.
 
The Collaboration Agreement operates under a Research Operating Plan (ROP) which includes goals for both organizations. In January 2021, the Company announced it had completed all research obligations under the Collaboration Agreement, and that Merck is now solely responsible for further development of the influenza A/B antiviral compounds that were discovered in the collaboration using Cocrystal’s unique structure-based technologies and Nobel Prize-winning expertise.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense and rapidly changing competition as companies seek to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face worldwide competition from larger biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities and other academic or research institutions and government agencies that are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products similar to our product candidates that target the viruses we are seeking to treat. We know of several companies that have marketed or are developing products for the treatment of influenza, coronavirus and HCV, including Roche, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”), Merck, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Toyama Chemical Co., Shionogi/Roche and Abbvie, Inc. Their products are widely considered effective. Further, in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic a number of third parties, including large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc., Moderna, Inc., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and academic institutions have been conducting research aimed at development of an effective treatment for, or a vaccine against, COVID-19. A number of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 have been commercialized under the FDA’s emergency use authorization. At least one treatment and four vaccines for COVID-19 have received FDA approval. Many of the companies developing products for the viral diseases that are the focus of our programs have substantially greater financial resources, including government funding, expertise and capabilities than we do and have existing products in significantly more advanced stages of development. Additionally, viral mutations can lead to new strains or variants of a virus that may be more resistant to products we develop when compared to those of competitors. See “Risk Factors” for more information on the risks we face with respect to our competition.
 
To date, we have not fully developed, received regulatory approval for or commercialized any of our product candidates. Our ability to compete will depend, to a great extent, on the speed in which we and our collaborators can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and regulatory approval processes, and coordinate with third parties to produce and distribute the resulting products in sufficient commercial quantities to create and maintain a market for such products at favorable costs and prices. If we do complete development of and obtain regulatory approval to market any product candidate, we anticipate that the competition we would face with respect to such product would be based on a combination of a number of factors including efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other factors.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. Any product candidates we develop must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in other countries. The clinical testing of product candidates to establish their safety and efficacy in humans is subject to substantial statutory and regulatory requirements with which we must comply.
 
In addition to the U.S. requirements such as those enforced by the FDA with respect to safety and efficacy of research, testing, development and production, we also must comply with applicable laws and regulations of any foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, our Phase 1 trial in Australia in 2022 for CC-42344, our lead Influenza A product candidate, caused us to be subject to the Australian government’s laws and regulations pertaining to the research and development, including clinical testing on human subjects, of therapeutic product candidates. Our presence in Australia has also subjected us to more general laws applicable to operations abroad, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and comparable legislation and regulation in foreign jurisdictions. In general, the FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Further, because of our reliance on one or more CROs and CMOs with respect to our research and development activities both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions, we may have limited control over compliance with such requirements in certain instances.

With respect to coronavirus-related products as of the date of this Report, with the exception of Veklury (remdesivir), an antiviral drug commercialized by Gilead, no treatment has been approved by the FDA for COVID-19 symptoms. Instead, most existing treatments for COVID-19 that are or have been offered by competing companies have been made available under the FDA’s emergency use authorization. The FDA has, however, reduced or removed many of these authorizations, including for treatments using monoclonal antibodies such as the REGEN-COV treatment commercialized by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., due to waning efficacy against symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the virus which until recently was the dominant strain. As the foregoing description demonstrates, our coronavirus programs and any product candidates that we may develop therefrom are subject to uncertainty as to the FDA’s actions, which are in turn inherently unpredictable given the unpredictable nature of the virus and its mutations, as well as their effects on treatment compounds.
