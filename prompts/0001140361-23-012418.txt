Background
 
Merger with NTN Buzztime, Inc.
 
On August 12, 2020, Eterna (then known as NTN Buzztime, Inc.), Eterna LLC (then known as Brooklyn Immunotherapeutics LLC) and BIT Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Eterna (“Merger Sub”), entered into an agreement and plan of merger and reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other matters, Merger Sub merged with and into Eterna LLC, with Eterna LLC surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Eterna (the “Merger”). The Merger closed on March 25, 2021. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition, in which Eterna LLC was deemed the acquiring company for accounting purposes. In March 2021, we sold the NTN Buzztime legacy assets to a third party (the “Disposition”).
Acquisition of Novellus
    On July 16, 2021, we completed the acquisition (the “Novellus Acquisition”) of Novellus, Inc. (“Novellus”) and its subsidiary, Novellus Therapeutics Limited (“Novellus Limited”). At the time of the acquisition, Novellus was focused on the development of next-generation engineered mesenchymal stem cell therapies using mRNA-based cell reprogramming and gene editing technologies licensed from Factor Bioscience.  As part of the Novellus Acquisition, we also acquired 25.0% of the total outstanding equity interests of NoveCite, Inc. (“NoveCite”), a corporation focused on developing an allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell product for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (“ARDS”), including from COVID-19.

Recent Developments
    Cell Line Customization and License Agreement
 
On February 21, 2023, we entered into a cell line customization and license agreement (the “Lineage Agreement”) with Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lineage”), pursuant to which, Lineage may request prior to August 22, 2023 that we develop for, and deliver to, Lineage certain induced pluripotent stem cell lines, which Lineage would use to evaluate the possible development of cell transplant therapies for treatment of diseases of the central nervous system in humans, (a) excluding ophthalmologic indications, (b) diseases and conditions of the peripheral nervous system, (c) psychiatric, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and hematological diseases, disorders, and conditions, and (d) cancer.  The Lineage Agreement also provides Lineage with the option to obtain an exclusive sublicense to certain related technology for preclinical, clinical and commercial purposes, which would permit Lineage to sublicense such intellectual property, subject to payment of certain sublicense royalty fees.  Lineage has six months from our delivery to Lineage of such induced pluripotent stem cell lines to exercise such option, and upon any such exercise, Lineage would agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to exploit and make commercially available one or more licensed products derived from such induced pluripotent stem cell lines in accordance with the Lineage Agreement. Upon entry into the Lineage Agreement, Lineage paid us a $250,000 non-refundable up-front payment.  We are also entitled to certain cell line customization fees with respect to cell lines that Lineage may request that we develop for Lineage, as well as royalty payments with respect to any such licensed products, certain sublicense fees and certain milestone payments under the Lineage Agreement.
Name and Ticker Symbol Changes and Nasdaq Listing Change
 
On October 17, 2022, we changed our name from Brooklyn ImmunoTherapeutics, Inc. to Eterna Therapeutics Inc., and the trading symbol of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market changed from “BTX” to “ERNA.”  On January 11, 2023, we transferred the listing of our common stock from The Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market, on which our common stock continues to trade under the trading symbol “ERNA”.
Reverse Stock Split
 
Effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on October 16, 2022, we effected a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every twenty shares of the issued and outstanding common stock were automatically combined and reclassified into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Reverse Stock Split did not affect any stockholder’s ownership percentage of the common stock, alter the par value of the common stock or modify any voting rights or other terms of the common stock. The number of authorized shares of common stock under our Charter remains unchanged. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. In lieu of any fractional shares to which a stockholder would otherwise be entitled, we paid an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the fractional share to which the holder would otherwise be entitled and (ii) the then fair value of a share as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors.  We paid an aggregate of $719 for a total of 175 fractional shares.
 
All share and per share data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted for all periods presented to reflect the Reverse Stock Split.
 
Overview
 
mRNA, Gene-Editing, and Cellular Medicines
 
We are a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the potential of mRNA cell engineering to provide patients with transformational new medicines.  We have in-licensed a portfolio of over 100 patents covering key mRNA cell engineering technologies, including technologies for mRNA cell reprogramming, mRNA gene editing, the NoveSliceTM and UltraSliceTM gene-editing proteins, and the ToRNAdoTM mRNA delivery system, which we collectively refer to as our “mRNA technology platform.” We plan to develop and advance a pipeline of therapeutic products both internally and through strategic partnerships, with the near-term focus on deploying our mRNA technology platform through strategic partnerships.  We license our mRNA technology platform from Factor Limited under an exclusive license agreement.
 
Through strategic partnerships, we expect that our mRNA technology platform will be used for preclinical and eventual clinical development of product candidates for a variety of clinical indications. We expect that the initial product candidates developed by our strategic partners utilizing our mRNA technology platform will include hypoimmune induced pluripotent stem cell (“iPSC”)-derived product candidates for the treatment of neurological indications and iPSC-derived immune-modulating cells (“iIMCs”) for indications such as acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and solid tumors.
 
We refer to aspects of our mRNA technology platform as “mRNA delivery,” “mRNA gene editing” and “mRNA cell reprogramming.”
 


 
mRNA Delivery
 
Nucleic acids, such as mRNA, can be used to induce cells to express desired proteins, including proteins that are capable of re-writing genetic and epigenetic cellular programs. However, the plasma membrane surrounding cells normally protects cells from exogenous nucleic acids, preventing efficient uptake and protein translation. Delivery systems can be used to enhance the uptake of nucleic acids by cells.  Conventional delivery systems, such as lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”)-based delivery, often suffer from endosomal entrapment and toxicity, which can limit their therapeutic use.  Our mRNA delivery technology is designed to use a novel chemical substance that is designed to deliver nucleic acids, including mRNA, to cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Our nucleic-acid delivery technology is also designed for ex vivo delivery of mRNA encoding gene-editing proteins and reprogramming factors, including to primary cells, insertion of exogenous sequences into genomic safe-harbor loci, and in vivo delivery of mRNA to the brain, eye, skin, and lung, which may be useful for the development of mRNA-based therapeutic.
 
mRNA Gene Editing
 
Our mRNA gene-editing technology is designed to delete, insert, and repair DNA sequences in living cells, which may be useful for correcting disease-causing mutations, making cells resistant to infection and degenerative disease, modulating the expression of immunoregulatory proteins to enable the generation of durable allogeneic cell therapies, and engineering immune cells to more effectively fight cancer.
 
Conventional gene-editing technologies typically employ plasmids or viruses to express gene-editing proteins, which can result in low-efficiency editing and unwanted mutagenesis when an exogenous nucleic acid fragment is inserted at random locations in the genome. Our mRNA gene-editing technology instead is designed to employ mRNA to express gene-editing proteins, which can potentially enable gene editing without unwanted insertional mutagenesis, because, unlike conventional gene-editing technologies that employ viruses or DNA-based vectors, mRNA does not typically cause unwanted insertional mutagenesis. We believe the efficiency of our mRNA gene-editing technology has the potential to support development of product candidates that could create new therapeutic approaches. For example, we anticipate that our mRNA gene-editing technology can be used to generate allogeneic chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (“CAR-T”) therapies for the treatment of cancer. In such allogeneic CAR-T therapies, mRNA encoding gene-editing proteins would be used to inactivate the endogenous T-cell receptor to prevent therapeutic T-cells from causing graft-versus-host disease (“GvHD”). GvHD occurs when transplanted cells view the patient’s (i.e. the host’s) cells as a threat and attack the host’s cells. We expect that this same mechanism of action can generate allogeneic stem cell-derived therapies in which mRNA encoding gene-editing proteins could be used to inactivate one or more components of the human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”) complex to render the cells immuno-nonreactive or “stealth,” which may be useful for the development of allogeneic cell-based therapies.
 
mRNA Cell Reprogramming
 
Our mRNA cell-reprogramming technology is capable of generating clonal lines of pluripotent stem cells that can be expanded and differentiated into many desired cell types that may be useful for the development of regenerative cell therapies.
 
Conventional cell-reprogramming technologies (e.g., using Sendai virus or episomal vectors) can result in low efficiency reprogramming, can select for cells with abnormal growth characteristics, and can leave traces of the vector in reprogrammed cells. Our mRNA cell-reprogramming technology instead is designed to employ mRNA to express reprogramming factors, which can enable cell reprogramming without leaving traces of the vector in reprogrammed cells, because, unlike conventional cell-reprogramming technologies that employ viruses or DNA-based vectors, mRNA does not typically leave traces of the vector in reprogrammed cells.
 
IRX-2
 
IRX-2, our former clinical product candidate, is a mixed, human-derived cytokine product with multiple active constituents, including Interleukin-2, or IL2, and other key cytokines. Together, these cytokines are believed to signal, enhance and restore immune function suppressed by the tumor, thus enabling the immune system to attack cancer cells, unlike many existing cancer therapies, which rely on targeting the cancer directly. IRX-2 is prepared from the supernatant of pooled allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells, known as PBMCs, that have been stimulated using a proprietary process employing a specific population of cells and a specific mitogen.
 


 
We currently do not have plans to further develop the IRX-2 product candidate. Results of the 150-patient Phase 2b INSPIRE trial (the “INSPIRE trial”), released in June 2022, showed outcomes favored IRX-2 in certain predefined subgroups but the INSPIRE trial did not meet the primary endpoint of event-free survival at two years of follow up. There were no new safety signals observed with IRX-2.
 
The INSPIRE trial was the only Company-sponsored study of IRX-2.  IRX-2 has been studied externally in other clinical settings outside of head and neck cancer in the form of investigator sponsored trials, all of which have either ended or are not currently active. We had previously provided IRX-2 as a study drug and financial support to conduct those investigator sponsored trials, but are no longer providing either.
 
License and Royalty Agreements
 
Cell and Gene Therapy License Agreements
  
 Exclusive Factor License Agreement

 
In November 2020, Novellus Limited and Factor Limited entered into a license agreement (the “Novellus-Factor License Agreement”), pursuant to which Factor Limited granted to Novellus Limited an exclusive license to certain patents owned by Factor Limited for the development of certain stem cell-based cellular therapies for treating diseases and conditions in humans and animals.
 
In April 2021, Eterna LLC, Novellus Limited and Factor Limited entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Original Factor License Agreement”), pursuant to which Eterna LLC acquired an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property and mRNA cell reprogramming and gene editing technology for use in the development of certain mRNA, gene-editing, and cellular therapies to be evaluated and developed for treating human diseases, including certain types of cancer, sickle cell disease, and beta thalassemia.
 
As a result of the Novellus Acquisition, the rights and obligations of Novellus Limited under the Novellus-Factor License Agreement pertaining to any and all licensed products from Factor Limited inured to Eterna, and the Original Factor License Agreement remained unchanged.
 
 In November 2022, following the expiration of one of the delineated milestone deadlines for certain regulatory filings required under the Novellus-Factor License Agreement, which permitted Factor Limited to terminate the license granted to Novellus Limited thereunder, we entered into the first amendment to the Original Factor License Agreement (the “Amended Factor License Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Factor Limited granted to Eterna LLC an exclusive, sublicensable license under certain patents owned by Factor Limited (the “Factor Patents”) for the purpose of identifying and pursuing certain opportunities to grant to third parties sublicenses to the Factor Patents. The Amended Factor License Agreement also (i) terminated the Novellus-Factor License Agreement, (ii) confirmed Factor Limited’s grant to Eterna LLC of the rights and licenses Novellus Limited previously granted to Eterna LLC under the Novellus-Factor License Agreement on the same terms and conditions as granted by Novellus Limited to Eterna LLC under such agreement, (iii) confirmed that the sublicense granted by Novellus Limited in accordance with the Novellus-Factor License Agreement to NoveCite (as discussed below), survived termination of the Novellus-Factor License Agreement and (iv) removed Novellus Limited from the Amended Factor License Agreement and the NoveCite Agreement and replaced Novellus Limited with Factor Limited as the direct licensor to Eterna LLC and NoveCite under such agreements, respectively.
 
On February 20, 2023, we and Factor Limited entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Exclusive Factor License Agreement”), which terminated and replaced in its entirety the Amended Factor License Agreement.  Subject to certain exclusive licenses or other rights granted by Factor Limited to certain third parties as of the effective date of the Exclusive Factor License Agreement, Factor granted us the exclusive, sublicensable license under the Factor Patents.
 


 
 The term of the Exclusive Factor License Agreement expires on November 22, 2027, but will be automatically extended for an additional two and a half years (such period, the “Renewal Term”) if we receive at least $100 million in fees from sublicenses to the Factor Patents (“Sublicense Fees”) granted by us pursuant to the Exclusive Factor License Agreement.  Pursuant to the Exclusive Factor License Agreement, we will pay to Factor 20% of any Sublicense Fee received by us before the initial expiration date of such license and 30% of any Sublicense Fees received by us during the Renewal Term.  We may terminate the Exclusive Factor License Agreement upon 120 days’ written notice to Factor, and both parties otherwise have additional customary termination rights, including in connection with certain uncured material breaches of the Exclusive Factor License Agreement and specified bankruptcy events.  Under the Exclusive Factor License Agreement, we are obligated to pay the expenses incurred by Factor Limited in preparing, filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Factor Patents and agreed to bear all costs and expenses associated with enforcing and defending the Factor Patents in any action or proceeding arising from pursuit of sublicensing opportunities under the license granted under the Exclusive Factor License Agreement.
 
There can be no assurance that we can successfully develop and commercialize the technology licensed under the Exclusive Factor License Agreement. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry—We depend substantially, and expect in the future to continue to depend, on in-licensed intellectual property. Such licenses impose obligations on our business, and if we fail to comply with those obligations, we could lose license rights, which would substantially harm our business” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 
 NoveCite

 
In October 2020, Novellus Limited (as sublicensor) and NoveCite (as sublicensee) entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “NoveCite Agreement”) to license a novel cellular therapy for acute respiratory indications, which Novellus Limited was licensing from Factor Limited under the Novellus-Factor License Agreement.  As discussed above, as a result of the Amended Factor License Agreement and the termination of the Novellus-Factor License Agreement, the NoveCite Agreement was amended to remove Novellus Limited as sublicensor and create a direct license between Factor Limited and NoveCite effective November 1, 2022.


IRX-2 License Agreements
 
 Unless otherwise stated below, each royalty to be paid under these license and royalty agreements is payable until the last patent for IRX-2 expires and runs in perpetuity unless earlier terminated pursuant to the terms described below. There are no milestone payments due under any of these agreements. While the licenses described below remain in force, we currently do not have plans to further develop the IRX-2 product candidate.
License Agreement with the University of South Florida Research Association
 
 On June 28, 2000, IRX Therapeutics, a predecessor of Eterna LLC, entered into a series of License Agreements (collectively, as amended, the “USF License Agreement”) with the University of South Florida Research Association, Inc. (“Research Association”). Pursuant to the USF License Agreement, the Research Association licensed to IRX Therapeutics the exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents on IRX-2 in exchange for royalties equal to 7% of the gross product sales of IRX-2. The USF License Agreement was assigned to Eterna LLC in connection with the sale of the assets of IRX Therapeutics to Eterna LLC in November 2018.


Royalty Agreement with certain former IRX Therapeutics investors
 
 On May 1, 2012, IRX Therapeutics entered into a royalty agreement (the “IRX Investor Royalty Agreement”) with certain investors who participated in a financing transaction. The IRX Investor Royalty Agreement was assigned to Eterna LLC in November 2018 when Eterna LLC acquired the assets of IRX Therapeutics. Pursuant to the IRX Investor Royalty Agreement, if and when Eterna LLC becomes obligated to pay royalties to the Research Association under the USF License Agreement, it will pay an additional royalty of 1% of gross sales to an entity organized by the investors who participated in such financing transaction.


Collaborator License Agreement
 
 Effective June 28, 2018, IRX Therapeutics terminated its Research, Development and Option Facilitation Agreement and certain related agreements with a collaborative partner (the “Collaborator”), pursuant to a termination agreement (the “Termination Agreement”). The Termination Agreement was assigned to Eterna LLC in connection with the sale of the assets of IRX Therapeutics to Eterna LLC in November 2018.  As consideration for entering into the Termination Agreement, the Collaborator is entitled to receive a royalty equal to 6% of revenues from the sale of IRX-2, for the period of time beginning with the first sale of IRX-2 through the later of (i) the twelfth anniversary of the first sale of IRX-2, or (ii) the expiration of the last IRX patent or other exclusivity of IRX-2.
Investor Royalty Agreement
 
 On November 6, 2018, Eterna LLC entered into a royalty agreement, as amended (the “Royalty Agreement”) with Brooklyn Immunotherapeutics Investors LP (“Investors LP”) and Brooklyn Immunotherapeutics Investors GP (“Investors GP”), and certain beneficial holders of Investors LP and Investors GP, which entities provided the financing required by Eterna LLC in connection with Eterna LLC’s acquisition of the assets of IRX Therapeutics. Under the Royalty Agreement, Eterna LLC is required to pay royalties to Investors LP, Investors GP and such beneficial holders based on gross sales of IRX-2. This royalty continues in perpetuity.  The Royalty Agreement specifies royalty payments to certain beneficial holders, including Charles Cherington and Nicholas J. Singer, who are both current directors and stockholders of Eterna; however, we have not paid and, because we are no longer pursuing the development of IRX-2, we do not expect to pay, any such royalties.

Patent Term and Term Extensions
 
 Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States and the European Union are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically are also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. All taxes or annuities for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.


 The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.


 Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. As of March 17, 2022, three of our in-licensed patents were subject to re-examination by the USPTO: US 90/019,127, re-examination of US10,662,410, US 90/019,128, re-examination of US10,829,738, and US 90/019,129, re-examination of US10,982,229. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see Item 1A “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




 
Supply and Manufacturing
 
 We currently do not have any agreements for the supply or manufacturing of cell lines. However, together with our license partner, Factor Limited, we believe that we have considerable experience in developing engineered cell lines. Pursuant to a Master Services Agreement, dated as of September 9, 2022 (the “MSA”), by and between us and Factor Bioscience Inc. (“Factor Bioscience”), the parent company of Factor Limited, Factor Bioscience has agreed to provide us with certain mRNA cell engineering research support services, including (i) access to Factor Bioscience’s research laboratory facilities located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, (ii) access to Factor Bioscience’s scientific equipment, (iii) training of our research staff in certain mRNA, iPSC, and gene editing technologies, (iv) copies of protocols, formulations, and sequences that may be useful for the development of mRNA cell engineering products and (v) in vitro transcription templates, mRNA constructs, and iPS cells that may be useful for the development of mRNA cell engineering products. To the extent that we need to obtain a supply of cell lines or manufacture them, we expect to contract with a contract manufacturing organization or to enter into a new work order under the MSA.
Regulatory Matters
 
Government regulation and product approval
 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, record-keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Drugs and biologics must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, (“NDA”) process or the Biologic License Application (“BLA”) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. Henceforth, we will use the term “marketing application,” or MA, to apply to both.


 There are two centers within the FDA that are responsible for the review and approval of drug and biologic marketing applications and general regulatory oversight: the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”). While all conventional drug products are regulated by CDER, biologic products can be regulated by either CDER or CBER, depending on the product’s classification.


 The majority of BLA submissions are assigned to CBER; however, BLAs for certain biologic product categories are reviewed by CDER. These product categories include monoclonal antibodies for in vivo use, most proteins for therapeutic use, and categories such as cytokines, enzymes, and other novel proteins. Regardless of the category, NDAs for all drug products fall under the jurisdiction of CDER.


 In the United States, drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(“FDCA”) and implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Services Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Additionally, drugs and biologics are subject to other federal and state statutes. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

   
● | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before the trials are initiated; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use conducted in compliance with federal regulations and good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of human clinical trial subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to, and acceptance by, the FDA of a MA;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of our manufacturing facility or other facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MA: and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the MA.
--+-----------------------------------

 
 The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.


United States drug development process
 
 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Prior to beginning human clinical trials, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which includes the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data. Some pre-clinical or non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the pre-clinical studies, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may, at any time, impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.


 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with federal regulations and GCP.


 Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, an IRB affiliated with each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before any clinical trial commences at that institution. All research subjects must provide informed consent, and informed consent information must be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to initiation of the trial and prior to providing it to potential subjects. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if adverse events or other certain types of other changes occur.


 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three phases. A fourth, or post-approval, phase may include additional clinical studies. These phases generally include the following, and may be sequential, or may overlap or be combined:

    
● | Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into human subjects. These studies are designed to determine the safety of usually single doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting intolerance, as well as evidence of the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. For some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially if the product may be too toxic to administer to healthy humans, the initial clinical trials may be conducted in individuals having a specific disease for which use the tested product is indicated. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for specific, targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In Phase 3, if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 (or occasionally Phase 1) studies, the Phase 3 studies will be conducted to further confirm clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded population which may involve geographically diverse clinical trial sites. Generally, but not always, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a marketing application. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4 clinical trials are studies required of or agreed to by a sponsor that are conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations. If the FDA approves a product while a company has ongoing clinical trials that were not necessary for approval, a company may be able to use the data from these clinical trials to meet all or part of any Phase 4 clinical trial requirement. Failure to promptly conduct Phase 4 clinical trials where necessary could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
While Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies are generally required for approval of a marketing application, certain drugs and biologics may not require one or more steps in the process depending on other testing and the situation involved. Additionally, the FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may stop testing at any time if results show patients being exposed to unnecessary health risks or overly dangerous side effects.  Prior to the initiation of a clinical trial or at any time during the conduct of studies with human subjects, the FDA may place a study on clinical hold where patients may not be enrolled and ongoing trial activities are suspended until questions around potential safety issues with investigational products are addressed.


 In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.


 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the mechanism of action and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other requirements, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and validated, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.


United States drug review and approval process
 
 Following completion of clinical studies, the results are evaluated and, depending on the outcome, submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA in order to obtain FDA approval of the product and authorization to commence commercial marketing. In responding to an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require additional testing or information, may require that the product labeling be modified, may impose a post-approval study and other commitments or reporting requirements or other restrictions on product distribution, or may deny the application.  The timing of final FDA review and action varies greatly but can take years in some cases and may involve the input of an FDA advisory committee of outside experts. Product sales in the United States may commence only upon FDA approval of an NDA or BLA.


 FDA approval of a marketing application is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The MA must include the results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the chemistry, manufacture and controls utilized in manufacture of the product. In addition, a MA must also demonstrate purity, specifically in terms of showing that the final product does not contain extraneous material. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of the MA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before accepting it for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an MA for filing. In this event, the MA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The submission of an MA is also subject to the payment of a substantial application fee (for FDA fiscal year 2023 this fee may exceed 3 million dollars, although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including when the drug that is subject of the application has received Orphan Drug Designation for the indication sought). Further, the sponsor of an approved MA is subject to an annual program fee, which for FDA fiscal year 2023 is $393,933 per prescription drug product. User fees typically increase annually. The approval process is lengthy and complex, and the FDA may refuse to approve an MA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA reviews an application to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. Before approving an MA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured to determine whether its manufacturing is cGMP–compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, potency, quality, purity and stability.




 
 If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will issue a complete response letter. The complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and often requires additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA may withhold approval of a MA regardless of prior advice it may have provided or commitments it may have made to the sponsor.


 Once an MA is approved, changes to the conditions of approval, including additional indications, are made by the submission of a supplement to the MA The supplemental NDA, or sNDA, or the supplemental BLA, or sBLA must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an MA, FDA determines whether the supplemental application is sufficiently complete to permit review before it is filed. FDA then reviews the supplemental application. The FDA can either approve or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies.


Manufacturing readiness
 
 As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance.  If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply or cannot remedy regulator identified deficiencies, then we may be prohibited from marketing product.


 If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the MA. Certain changes to an approved MA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Products whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including corrective advertising, cessation of violative promotion, withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.


 Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.




 
Post-approval requirements and consideration
 
 Once an MA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA and Federal Trade Commission closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. As a condition of MA approval, the FDA may also require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for the healthcare professionals, and other Elements to Assure Safe Use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug or biologic.


 Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new MA supplement before the change can be implemented. An MA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing MA supplements as it does in reviewing MAs.


 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an MA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.


Foreign regulatory requirements
 
 In addition to regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies, we are also subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and the marketing of other products. Outside of the United States, our ability to market a product depends upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory agencies. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In any country, however, we will only be permitted to commercialize our products if the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that we have presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The regulatory approval and oversight process in other countries includes all of the risks associated with regulation by the FDA and certain state regulatory agencies as described above.


  Under the European Union regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized manner. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) may lead to an approval granted by the European Commission which permits marketing of the product throughout the European Union. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of nationally approved decisions and is used for products that do not comply with requirements for the centralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the European Union may submit further applications to other countries within the European Union, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization based on an assessment report provided by the country in which marketing authorization is held.




 
Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement
 
 In both United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our products successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our products, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, private commercial health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic or other studies in order to further demonstrate the value of our products. Even with the availability of such studies, any future products of ours may be considered less safe, less effective or less cost-effective than alternative products, and third-party payors may not provide coverage and reimbursement for any future product candidates, in whole or in part.


 Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental changes. There have been, and we expect there will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”).


 We anticipate that in the United States, Congress, state legislatures, and private sector entities will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures could include:

 

● | controls on government-funded reimbursement for drugs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | mandatory rebates or additional charges to manufacturers for their products to be covered on Medicare Part D formularies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | controls on healthcare providers;
--+----------------------------------


● | controls on pricing of pharmaceutical products, including the possible reference of the pricing of United States drugs to non-United States drug pricing for the same product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reform of drug importation laws;
--+---------------------------------


● | entering into contractual agreements with payors; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | expansion of use of managed-care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) contained several provisions designed to curb the prices of drugs and biologics to Medicare beneficiaries.  For instance, the IRA will require the federal government to directly negotiate the prices of certain drugs and biologics beginning in 2026.  Additionally, beginning in 2023, the IRA requires manufacturers of drugs and biologics to offer rebates if the price of the drug or biologic raises faster than inflation.  These and other provisions in the IRA could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.
 
We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.


 Further, the pricing of pharmaceutical products generally, and particularly the pricing of orphan drugs, has recently received scrutiny from the press and from members of Congress in both parties. Some members of the medical community have also made statements in the press on the pricing of orphan drugs. The impact of this scrutiny on the pricing of orphan drugs and other pharmaceutical products generally cannot be determined with any certainty at this time.


 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was included in the Affordable Care Act, authorized the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. Under the Affordable Care Act, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biologic product or “reference product.” Manufacturers may not submit an application for a biosimilar to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and the FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if IRX-2 or any other biologic product we may acquire or in-license, if approved, are deemed to be reference products eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product.




 
Orphan drug exclusivity
 
 Some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs or biologic products for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (“ODA”), the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologic products intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. In the United States, orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The grant of an orphan drug designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a product candidate must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has been granted orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the drug.


 The orphan drug exclusivity contained in the ODA has been the subject of recent scrutiny from the press, from some members of Congress and from some in the medical community. There can be no assurance that the exclusivity granted in ODA to orphan drugs approved by the FDA will not be modified in the future, and as to how any such change might affect our products.


  The European Orphan Drug Regulation is considered for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition afflicting five or fewer per 10,000 people in the EU, including compounds that for serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. The medicinal product considered should be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Benefits of being granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation are significant, including ten years of marketing exclusivity with a potential two-year extension. The EU Community and Member States may not accept or grant for ten years a new marketing authorization or application for another drug for the same therapeutic indication as the orphan drug, although the ten-year period can be reduced to six years if, after the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of the marketing exclusivity. A supplementary protection certificate may extend the protection six months beyond patent expiration if that is later than the orphan drug exclusivity period. To apply for the supplementary protection, a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, must be included in the market application. In Europe all drugs now seeking marketing authorization need to have a PIP agreed with the EMA before it can be approved, even if it is a drug being developed specifically for a pediatric indication. If a product is developed solely for use in the pediatric population, then a Pediatric Use Marketing Authorization, or PUMA, may provide eight years of data exclusivity and ten years of marketing exclusivity.


Fast track designation and accelerated approval
 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs or biologics that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast-track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request that FDA designate the product candidate for a specific indication as a fast-track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the product qualifies for fast-track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.




 
 Under the fast track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a product for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.


 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for products approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA.


 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast-track drug’s MA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the MA is submitted. Additionally, the fast-track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if they believe that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.


Priority review
 
 Under FDA policies, a product candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six to eight-month time frame from the time a complete MA is submitted, if the product candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs.


Disclosure of clinical trial information
 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the clinical trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Finally, there can be no assurance that fast track designation will result in a faster review process.


Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws, Stark Law & the Prescription Drug Marketing Act
 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback prohibition, statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, or Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and patients, prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.




 
 Federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.


 Federal law includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits a physician (defined to include a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine, a doctor of podiatric medicine, a doctor of optometry, or a chiropractor) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to certain types of entities with which the physician or any of the physician’s immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception to the law’s prohibition is met. Subject to adherence to their respective criteria requirements, the self-referral prohibition contains a number of exceptions, including exceptions covering employment or independent contractor arrangements, space and equipment leases, and recruitment agreements.  Sanctions within the Stark Law include significant civil penalties including over $25,000 for each violation, over $169,000 for schemes to circumvent the Stark Law restrictions, and up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.  Violations of the Stark Law may also result in payment denials, false claim recoveries, civil monetary penalties, and/or federal program exclusion.  Further, several states have enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the Stark Law. These state laws may mirror the federal Stark Law or may be different in scope. The available guidance and enforcement activity associated with such state laws varies considerably.


 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations require manufacturers of approved prescription drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies, for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually collect and report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported each year is made publicly available on a searchable website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.


 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.


 Prescription drug advertising is subject to federal, state and foreign regulations. In the United States, the FDA, along with the Federal Trade Commission, regulates prescription drug promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Any distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the United States Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, a part of the FDCA. In addition, Title II of the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, has imposed new “track and trace” requirements on the distribution of prescription drug products by manufacturers, distributors, and other entities in the drug supply chain. The DSCSA requires product identifiers (i.e., serialization) on prescription drug products in order to eventually establish an electronic interoperable prescription product system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States and preempts existing state drug pedigree laws and regulations on this topic. The DSCSA also establishes new requirements for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistic providers. The FDA is the process of finalizing regulations addressing wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. We serialize our product at both the package and homogeneous case level, pass serialization and required transaction information to our customers, and believe that we comply with all such requirements.




 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, sets standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information that is stored or transmitted electronically.  These include standards for common healthcare transactions, such as: claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals; and security, privacy, breach notification and enforcement.  HIPAA transaction regulations establish form, format and data content requirements for most electronic healthcare transactions, such as healthcare claims that are submitted electronically. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive requirements relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information. The HIPAA security regulations establish minimum standards for the protection of protected health information that is stored or transmitted electronically. The HIPAA breach notification regulations establish the applicable requirements for notifying individuals, the HHS, and the media in the event of a data breach affecting protected health information. Violations of the privacy, security and breach notification regulations are punishable by civil and criminal penalties.


 In addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that regulate the collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of health information and other confidential, sensitive and personal data. Certain of these laws grant individuals rights with respect to their information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. For example, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including protected health information. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies.


Competition
 
 We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, product development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining marketing approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing pharmaceutical products. Some of these companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products or strategic partnerships with entities with products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make our mRNA technology platform or any therapeutic products that we develop obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and/or marketing approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products in our field before we do.

     There are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments include both small molecule drug products, such as traditional chemotherapy, as well as novel immunotherapies. Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop intellectual property and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe effects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more effectively, are reimbursed or are less expensive than any products developed using our intellectual property or that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other marketing approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.




 
Human Capital Resources
 
Employees
 
 We perform in a highly competitive industry and recognize that our success relies upon our ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse team of talented individuals. We place high value on the satisfaction and well-being of our employees and operate with fair labor standards and industry-competitive compensation and benefits. As of March 20, 2023, we had nine full-time employees, which includes four research and development positions and five administrative positions. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Compensation, Benefits and Development
 
 Our approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to our values and alignment with the interests of our stockholders.


 Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We may also provide our employees with opportunities to earn cash and equity incentive compensation to reward the achievement of company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our company. Our employees are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align interests of our employees with that of our stockholders.  All employees also participate in a regular performance measurement process through which staff receive performance and development feedback, which is taken into account in determining annual compensation.


 Our benefit programs are generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All employees are eligible to participate in the same health and retirement savings plans.


Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
 
 We are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics emphasizes the importance of integrity, honesty, forthrightness, respect and fairness.  Our Code of Conduct and Ethics applies to all our employees, including those who are integrated into the Company through acquisitions.


Health, Safety and Well-Being
 
 We actively promote the safety, health and well-being of our employees. For example, we focused on employee safety throughout the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing extensive safety measures, which have included, on-site COVID-19 testing protocols and flexible remote working options for most of our employees.
