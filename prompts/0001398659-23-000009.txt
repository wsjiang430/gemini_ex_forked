Item 1. Business 
Genpact is a global professional services firm that makes business transformation real. We drive digital-led innovation and run digitally-enabled intelligent operations for our clients, guided by our experience over time running thousands of processes for hundreds of Fortune Global 500 companies. We have over 118,900 employees serving clients in key industry verticals from more than 35 countries. Our 2022 total net revenues were $4.4 billion.
In 2022, we continued to invest for long-term growth following a strategy focused on delivering differentiated, domain-led solutions in a focused set of geographies, industry verticals and service lines. During the year, we sharpened our focus on a portfolio of clients who are on significant digital transformation journeys and for whom we believe we can drive meaningful business outcomes. We also continued to invest in our emerging service lines, including supply chain, sales and commercial, and risk, which aim to expand our influence to client buying centers beyond the chief financial officer where we have historically built our strongest relationships. Additionally, we continued to focus on the learning and development of our employees to provide them with the critical skills needed for the future and to build their careers. Over the past several years, our services have evolved from focusing mainly on improving cost and efficiencies to driving meaningful business outcomes for our clients, including growth and better decision-making using our strategic insights. 
Our approach
Many of our client solutions are embedded with our Digital Smart Enterprise ProcessesSM (Digital SEPs), a patented and highly granular approach to recognize the critical factors that dramatically improve business performance to help drive client outcomes. Our Digital SEPs combine Lean Six Sigma methodologies – which reduce inefficiency and improve process quality – with advanced domain-specific digital technologies, drawing on our industry acumen, our expertise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and experience-centric principles, and our deep understanding of how businesses run. Digital SEPs test the effectiveness of client processes using best-in-class benchmarks developed by mapping and analyzing millions of client transactions across thousands of end-to-end business processes. In this way, we identify opportunities for improving clients’ operations by applying our deep process knowledge and process-centric technologies to transform them.
Genpact Cora, our AI-based platform, integrates our proprietary automation, analytics and AI technologies with those of our strategic partners into a unified offering. It draws insights from our deep domain and operations expertise in our target industries and service lines to create analytics-based solutions that are focused on improving customer and user experience to accelerate clients’ digital transformations. 
Domain-led digital transformation
Industry disruption is pervasive, driven by an explosion in digital technologies, increased use of data and analytics, new competitors, and shifting market dynamics. In this environment, companies need industry-tailored solutions to reimagine their business models end-to-end and adapt to rapid change. 
These organizations seek partners that can improve productivity while creating competitive advantages and driving business outcomes, such as expanded market share, seamless customer experiences, increased revenue, working capital improvement, increased profitability, and minimized risk and loss. We believe our approach to business transformation, enabled through combining our deep industry and process expertise with our advanced skills in digital and analytics, differentiates us from our competitors.
We partner with clients to show them how new digital solutions can drive business outcomes. We apply user and customer experience principles to our domain expertise and innovative technology to create solutions designed to quickly and aptly meet client objectives. The results can include quick-turnaround proof of concept prototypes that clients can install and test in their own environments.
We enable domain-led digital transformation for our clients through our Digital Operations Services and Data-Tech-AI Services. 
Digital Operations Services
Our Digital Operations services embed digital, advanced analytics and cloud-based offerings into our business process outsourcing solutions where we transform and run our clients’ operations with an aim to achieve higher levels of end-to-end performance. These services allow enterprises to be more flexible and help them focus on high-value work to better compete in their industries. Our Digital Operations solutions also include certain IT services functions, including end-user computing support and infrastructure production support.
The ability to organize complex data sets and use analytics to derive actionable insights is increasingly critical to drive business outcomes for our clients. Our Enterprise360 intelligence platform enables our clients to harness the power of data and insights derived from running our clients' operations leveraging proprietary metrics and benchmarks from our Digital SEPs. This platform also uses AI for prescriptive actions to pinpoint transformation opportunities that can unlock operational excellence and growth.

Our contracts with clients for Digital Operations services often take the form of a master services agreement ("MSA"), which is a framework agreement that we then supplement with statements of work ("SOWs") or other service level agreements, such as purchase orders or business services agreements ("BSAs"). These SOWs, purchase orders and BSAs cover in more detail the type of work to be performed and the associated amounts to be billed. For our Data-Tech-AI services, we typically enter into software-as-a-service and/or consulting agreements with our clients depending on the scope of the services to be performed. For more about our contracting frameworks, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Net Revenues.” 
Our people 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 118,900 employees working in more than 35 countries. As a talent-led organization, our people are critical to the success of our business. We have created, and constantly reinforce, a culture that emphasizes collaboration, innovation, process improvement, and dedication to our clients. We seek to foster a culture that wins clients, develops leaders and attracts and retains talent who exhibit our core values – curiosity, incisiveness and courage – who embody and enable our purpose — the relentless pursuit of a world that works better for people — and who uphold our dedication to integrity consistent with our Code of Conduct, Integrity@Genpact. 
Rewarding and recognizing our talent
We aim to create a work environment where every person is inspired to achieve, driven to perform and rewarded for their contributions. We strive to engage and competitively compensate our high-performing talent by providing performance-based promotions and merit-based compensation increases. In 2022, we promoted more than 14,000 of our employees and encouraged employee career growth through our Destination Growth program. We also regularly monitor employee retention levels and continue to enhance our pay-for-performance approach in an effort to retain our top talent. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion
We believe that a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to our business. We believe in equal opportunity for each individual, irrespective of their gender, age, ethnicity, cultural background, race or sexual orientation. Understanding each other’s uniqueness, recognizing our differences, respecting varied opinions and accepting various points of view is at the heart of our organization’s culture. We promote these values by seeking to maintain inclusive hiring and management practices and ensure that opportunities are equally open to all. 
We are committed to:
•Increasing diversity, including gender, racial and ethnic diversity, across all levels of the organization; 
•Recruiting, retaining and advancing talent, including from diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds; and
•Creating and fostering an inclusive culture where everybody, including our LGBTQ+ employees, feels safe and empowered.
Employee development and engagement
We are committed to the career development of our employees and making them future-ready, and we strive to engage them with challenging and rewarding career opportunities. Our performance management approach supports our 
career philosophy by encouraging employees to reflect on their performance, set challenging goals, receive feedback, identify their development needs and find relevant learning and training opportunities. We have also developed a number of leadership development and mentoring programs, including our Global Operations Leadership Development and our Leadership Direct programs for high potential talent and our programs designed to increase gender diversity in our leadership ranks, such as our Pay it Forward and Women’s Leadership initiatives.
We have also developed a learning framework called Genome that enables our employees to acquire new skills and evolve quickly as industries and technologies change, equipping them with skills that are relevant to their current roles and future aspirations. Genome was designed to shape an adaptive workforce, and its learning strategy was formulated to “reskill at scale” and be integrated throughout the enterprise.
TalentMatch is our talent transformation initiative to match the skills and job aspirations of our employees with existing and future job opportunities we have available. By enabling employees to prepare for their future career aspirations by upskilling and reskilling through Genome, TalentMatch has allowed us to identify talent available for redeployment from one part of our business to another as the needs of our clients change. It improves our employee utilization globally by providing the right talent at the right time for our client engagements. TalentMatch also gives our employees the opportunity to take their careers in their desired directions, thus increasing employee satisfaction, and bolstering our ability to scale the “work from anywhere” model.
Amber, our engagement AI chatbot and employee experience platform, enables transformation of our employee engagement strategy. Amber provides an outlet for unbiased and judgment free conversations for our employees and live predictive people analytics for business and HR leaders.
By digitizing how we engage with our employees through Amber, we have increased the scope and frequency of employee feedback and have gained the ability to assess employee engagement and identify trends in employee engagement and satisfaction across the company.
In 2022, we also invested in technologies and programs designed to create a better employee experience, with a particular focus on employee well being.
Corporate social responsibility
Our approach to corporate social responsibility focuses on two new pillars tied to our purpose: Better Access, which reflects our aim to provide the communities in which we operate with better access to heathcare, education and opportunities, and Better Planet, which reflects our aim to inform, educate, and catalyze action on the different facets of the environment and climate change and help make the planet work better for all. 
We foster a culture of giving and volunteering through several global platforms, projects, and social initiatives. More than 60,000 of our employees have volunteered their time to, among other things, help underprivileged children get better access to education, assist unemployed women in developing job skills, and work on projects to help improve infrastructure and education in the communities in which we work and live.
Additionally, in 2022 more than 7,000 of our employees participated in our payroll-based charitable donation programs, and many of our employee volunteers participated in virtual volunteering initiatives such as composting, planting saplings, or eliminating single-use plastic. We are also passionate about working collectively to reduce our carbon footprint.
Partnerships and alliances
We continue to invest in and expand our strategic alliances with companies whose services and solutions complement ours. Together, we work to enhance our existing solutions or create new offerings to meet market needs. 
Our alliances generally fall into one of the following categories: 
• Strategic, go-to-market partnerships
• Deal-specific relationships to jointly solve a specific issue for a client
• Reseller arrangements to provide third party partner software and cloud solutions
• Digital and other “white label” embedded technology-based relationships
We have three primary types of partners: consulting partners, digital partners, and solution partners. Our digital and solution partnerships aim to nurture relationships with established and emerging players. These potential partners specialize in leading-edge disruptive digital technologies and solutions that we can embed into our offerings or jointly bring to market.
Sales and marketing
We market our services to both existing and potential clients through our business development team. Like our client portfolio, members of this team are based around the globe. Our business development team focuses both on supporting our strategic client accounts and acquiring new clients.
We have designated lead client partners and global relationship managers for each of our strategic client relationships. These business development personnel are supported by industry and capability subject matter experts to ensure our services and solutions best address the needs of our clients. We continuously monitor our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels using metrics such as the Net Promoter Score. 
The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. The sales cycle for our advisory and project work is typically much shorter than the sales cycle for a large business process engagement. Our efforts may begin through an existing engagement with a client or in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. Our teams seek to understand the needs and priorities of our clients as well as the business outcomes our clients desire, and we leverage our combination of capability and industry expertise to create differentiated client solutions. We may expend substantial time and resources in engaging with prospective clients to secure new business. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Net Revenues.” 
As our relationship with a client deepens, the time required to win an engagement for additional services generally declines. In addition, during an engagement as we better understand and experience a client’s business and processes, we are able to identify incremental opportunities to deliver greater value for the client, including by leveraging our expanding portfolio of digital capabilities to transform our clients’ operations. 
We strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management teams. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value. High-level executive relationships present significant opportunities to increase business from our existing clients. These relationships also provide a forum for gathering feedback on service delivery performance and addressing client concerns. Our governance methodology is designed to ensure that we are well connected at all levels of our clients’ organizations (executive, management, technology and operations). 
Significant new business opportunities are reviewed by business leaders, lead client partners and global relationship managers from the applicable industry vertical along with operations personnel and members of our finance department. If they determine that the new business is aligned with our strategic objectives and a good use of our resources, then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity. 
Global delivery
We serve our clients using our global network of more than 80 delivery centers in more than 20 countries. We have delivery centers in Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. We also have many employees in these and additional countries, such as Canada, Ireland, Singapore, Spain and Turkey, who work with our clients either onsite or virtually, which offers flexibility for both clients and employees.
With this global network, we are able to manage complex processes around the world. We use different locations for different types of services depending on client needs and the mix of skills and cost of employees at each location.
Our global delivery model gives us:
•multilingual capabilities;
•access to a larger talent pool;
•“near-shoring” as well as off-shoring capabilities to take advantage of time zones; and
•proximity to our clients through a significant onshore presence.
We also regularly look for new places to open delivery centers and offices, both in new countries or new cities in countries where we already have a presence. Before we choose a new location, we consider several factors, such as the talent pool, infrastructure, government support, operating costs, and client demand.
Service delivery model
We seek to be a seamless extension of our clients’ operations. To that end, we developed the Genpact Virtual CaptiveSM service delivery model, in which we create a virtual extension of our clients’ teams and environments. Our 
clients get dedicated employees and management, as well as dedicated infrastructure at our delivery centers. We also train our teams in our clients’ cultures, processes, and business environments.
Intellectual Property 
The solutions we offer our clients often include a range of proprietary methodologies, software, and reusable knowledge capital. We also develop intellectual property in the course of our business and our agreements with our clients regulate the ownership of such intellectual property. We seek to protect our intellectual property and our brand through various means, including by agreement and applications for patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and domain names. Some of our intellectual property rights are trade secrets and relate to proprietary business process enhancements. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a portfolio of more than 50 patents and pending patent applications globally. Additionally, we have over 200 trademarks registered in various jurisdictions. 
We often use third-party and client software platforms and systems to provide our services. Our agreements with our clients normally include a license to use the client’s proprietary systems to provide our services. Clients authorize us to access and use third party software licenses held by the client so that we may provide our services. 
It is our practice to enter into agreements with our employees and independent contractors that:
•ensure that all new intellectual property developed by our employees or independent contractors in the course of their employment or engagement is assigned to us;
•provide for employees’ and independent contractors’ cooperation in intellectual property protection matters even if they no longer work for us; and
•include a confidentiality undertaking by our employees and independent contractors.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market. We have a number of competitors offering services that are the same as or similar to ours. Our competitors include: 
•large multinational service providers, primarily accounting and consulting firms, that provide consulting and other professional services;
•companies that are primarily business process service providers operating from low-cost countries, most commonly India;
•companies that are primarily information technology service providers with some business process service capabilities; and
•smaller, niche service providers that provide services or products in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including digital.
We may also face losses or potential losses of business when in-house departments of companies use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. Our business model is also subject to competitive forces from the advent of novel technology or applications of these technological capabilities made readily available in open-market environments.
Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include:
• deep expertise in industry-specific domains and processes; 
• ability to advise clients on how to transform their processes and deliver transformation that drives business value; 
• ability to provide innovative services and products, including digital offerings; 
• ability to consistently add value through digital transformation and continuous process improvement; 
• reputation and client references; 
• contractual terms, including competitive pricing and innovative commercial models; 
• scope of services; 
• quality of products, services and solutions; 
• ability to sustain long-term client relationships; and 
• global reach and scale. 
Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 
Regulation
We are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions around the world as a result of the complexity of our operations and services, particularly in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services. We are also subject to regulation by regional bodies such as the European Union ("EU"). 
In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some of our service contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us, and sometimes our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for them to comply with applicable requirements. In some of our service contracts, our clients undertake the responsibility to inform us about laws and regulations that may apply to us in jurisdictions in which they are located. 
If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may face restrictions on our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our clients generally have the right to terminate our contracts for cause in the event of regulatory failures, subject in some cases to notice periods. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Operations—Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business.” If we fail to comply with contractual commitments to facilitate our clients’ compliance, we may be liable for contractual damages, and clients in regulated industries may be less willing to use our services. 
We are affected by laws and regulations in the United States, the United Kingdom, the EU and its member states, and other countries in which we do business that are intended to limit the impact of outsourcing on employees in those jurisdictions, and occasional changes to laws and regulations in such jurisdictions may impose changes that further restrict or discourage offshore outsourcing or otherwise harm our business.  See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Operations—Recent and future legislation and executive action in the United States and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability or willingness of our clients and prospective clients to utilize our services.” 
Our collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal health-related and other information is subject to an array of privacy, data security, and data breach notification laws and regulations that change frequently, are inconsistent across the jurisdictions in which we do business, and impose significant compliance costs. In the United States, personal information is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy, data security, and breach notification, including, for example, the Financial Modernization Act (sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Communications Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia have implemented separate data security and breach notification laws with which we must comply; in addition, some states have strengthened their existing laws. Some courts have become more willing to allow individuals to pursue claims in data breach cases, indicating that it may become easier for consumers to sue companies for data breaches. Related laws and regulations govern our direct marketing activities and our use of personal information for direct marketing, including the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, and CAN-SPAM Act. In 2018, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act established new required processes and procedures for handling U.S. law enforcement requests for data that we may store outside of the U.S. In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR imposes privacy and data security compliance obligations and increased penalties for noncompliance. In particular, the GDPR has introduced numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects, increased data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and increased fines for violations. Additionally, foreign governments outside of the EU are also taking steps to fortify their data privacy laws and regulations. For example, India, as well as some countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, have either passed data privacy legislation or are considering data protection laws that affect or may affect us. Evolving laws and regulations in India protecting the use of personal information could also impact how we handle vendor and employee data in India. As privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve, these changes could adversely affect our business operations, websites and mobile applications that are accessed by residents in the applicable countries. 
In the United States, we are either directly subject to, or contractually required to comply or facilitate our clients’ compliance with, laws and regulations arising out of our work for clients operating there, especially in the area of banking, financial services and insurance, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Home Owners Loan Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and 
regulation by U.S. agencies such as the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Because of our debt collections work in the United States, we are also regulated by laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and related regulations. We are currently licensed to engage in debt collection activities in all jurisdictions in the United States where licensing is required. U.S. banking and debt collection laws and their implementing regulations are occasionally amended, and these changes may impose new obligations on us or may change existing obligations.
Because of our insurance processing activities in the United States, we are currently licensed as a third-party administrator in 42 states and are regulated by the department of insurance in each such state. In two other states, we qualify for regulatory exemption from licensing based on the insurance processing activities we provide. We also hold entity adjuster licenses in 22 states that require licensing.
Certain laws may apply to our content moderation activity, such as laws regulating hate speech on the internet. In the United States, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (the "CDA") shields “interactive computer services” (e.g., websites, social media platforms) from liability for the speech of their users, with certain exceptions. The law also shields interactive computer services from civil liability for a good faith action voluntarily taken to restrict access to or availability of content that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected. Section 230 of the CDA and other laws related to hate speech on the internet are currently the topic of significant debate. We expect that these laws will continue to evolve and change over time. Changes to the laws and regulations governing liability for speech on the internet may affect the business strategies and offerings of our clients, which may significantly change their approach to content moderation, and which, in turn, could reduce the market for our trust and safety related services.
In the United States, we are subject to laws and regulations governing foreign trade, such as export control, customs and sanctions regulations maintained by government bodies such as the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Homeland Security Department’s Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. Other jurisdictions, such as the EU, also maintain similar laws and regulations that apply to some of our operations. 
Several of our service delivery centers, primarily located in China, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Malaysia and the Philippines, benefit from tax incentives or concessional rates provided by local laws and regulations. In addition, certain benefits are also available to us in India as an information technology enabled service (ITES) company under certain Indian state and central laws. These benefits include labor law exemptions, preferential rates for the commercial usage of electricity and incentives related to the export of qualified services. 
Our hedging activities and currency transfers are restricted by regulations in certain countries, including China, India, the Philippines and Romania. 
Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 
As a Bermuda company, we are also subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended, regulating the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions from contributed surplus. We are classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Pursuant to our non-resident status, we may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars. There are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents that are holders of our common shares. 
Under Bermuda law, “exempted” companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda. 
Bermuda has economic substance requirements pursuant to the Economic Substance Act 2018, as amended, and the regulations proffered thereunder, which require us to have adequate economic substance in Bermuda in relation to certain of our activities.
Available Information
