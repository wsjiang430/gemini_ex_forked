Item 1.  Business
OVERVIEW

Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, unless context requires otherwise, “Helix,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in 1979 and in 1983 was re-incorporated in the state of Minnesota. We are an international offshore energy services company that provides specialty services to the offshore energy industry, with a focus on well intervention and robotics operations. We seek to provide services and methodologies that we believe are critical to maximizing production economics. We provide services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. Our “life of field” services are segregated into three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. For additional information regarding our strategy and business operations, see sections titled “Our Strategy” and “Our Operations” included elsewhere within Item 1. Business of this Annual Report.

Our principal executive offices are located at 3505 West Sam Houston Parkway North, Suite 400, Houston, Texas 77043; our phone number is 281-618-0400. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HLX.” Our Chief Executive Officer submitted the annual CEO certification to the NYSE as required under its Listed Company Manual in June 2018. Our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer have made the certifications required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report.

Please refer to the subsection “Certain Definitions” on page 13 for definitions of additional terms commonly used in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to Notes herein refers to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data located elsewhere in this Annual Report.

OUR STRATEGY

Our focus is on our well intervention and robotics businesses. We believe that focusing on these services will deliver favorable long-term financial returns. From time to time, we may make strategic investments that expand our service capabilities or add capacity to existing services in our key operating regions. We expect our well intervention fleet to expand with the completion and delivery in 2019 of the Q7000, a newbuild semi-submersible vessel. Chartering newer vessels with additional capabilities, such as the three Grand Canyon vessels, should enable our robotics business to better serve the needs of our customers. From a longer-term perspective we also expect to benefit from our fixed fee agreement for the Helix Producer I (the “HP I”), a dynamically positioned floating production vessel that processes production from the Phoenix field for the field operator until at least June 1, 2023.

In January 2015, Helix, OneSubsea LLC, OneSubsea B.V., Schlumberger Technology Corporation, Schlumberger B.V. and Schlumberger Oilfield Holdings Ltd. entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement and related agreements for the parties’ strategic alliance to design, develop, manufacture, promote, market and sell on a global basis integrated equipment and services for subsea well intervention. The alliance leverages the parties’ capabilities to provide a unique, fully integrated offering to clients, combining marine support with well access and control technologies. We and OneSubsea jointly developed a 15,000 working p.s.i. intervention riser system 
4

(“15K IRS”), each owning a 50% interest. The 15K IRS was completed and placed into service in January 2018. Our total investment in the 15K IRS was approximately $17 million. In October 2016, we and OneSubsea launched the development of our first Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (“ROAM”) for an estimated cost of approximately $6 million for our 50% interest. At December 31, 2018, our total investment in the ROAM was $5.6 million. The ROAM is expected to be available in 2019.

OUR OPERATIONS

We have three reportable business segments: Well Intervention, Robotics and Production Facilities. We provide a full range of services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. Our Well Intervention segment includes our vessels and equipment used to perform well intervention services primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the North Sea and West Africa. Our well intervention vessels include the Q4000, the Q5000, the Seawell, the Well Enhancer, and two chartered monohull vessels, the Siem Helix 1 and the Siem Helix 2. We also have a semi-submersible well intervention vessel under completion, the Q7000. Our well intervention equipment includes intervention riser systems (“IRSs”), some of which we provide on a stand-alone basis, and subsea intervention lubricators (“SILs”). Our Robotics segment includes remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), trenchers and ROVDrills, which are designed to complement offshore construction and well intervention services, and three ROV support vessels under long-term charter: the Grand Canyon, the Grand Canyon II and the Grand Canyon III. Our Production Facilities segment includes the HP I, the Helix Fast Response System (the “HFRS”) and our investment in Independence Hub, LLC (“Independence Hub”). All of our production facilities activities are located in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 13 for financial results related to our business segments.

Our current services include:


• | Production. Well intervention; intervention engineering; production enhancement; inspection, repair and maintenance of production structures, trees, jumpers, risers, pipelines and subsea equipment; and life of field support. 


• | Decommissioning. Reclamation and remediation services; well plugging and abandonment services; pipeline abandonment services; and site inspections. 


• | Development. Installation of flowlines, control umbilicals, manifold assemblies and risers; trenching and burial of pipelines; installation and tie-in of riser and manifold assembly; commissioning, testing and inspection; and cable and umbilical lay and connection. We have experienced increased demand for our services from the alternative energy industry. Some of the services that we provide to these alternative energy businesses include subsea power cable installation, trenching and burial, along with seabed coring and preparation for construction of wind turbine foundations. 


• | Production facilities. Provision of our HP I vessel as an oil and natural gas processing facility for services to oil and gas companies operating in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico. Currently, the HP I is being utilized to process production from the Phoenix field. 


• | Fast Response System. Provision of the HFRS as a response resource that can be identified in permit applications to federal and state agencies and respond to a well control incident. 

Well Intervention

We engineer, manage and conduct well construction, intervention and abandonment operations in water depths ranging from 200 to 10,000 feet. As major and independent oil and gas companies conduct operations in the deepwater basins of the world, development of these reserves will often require the installation of subsea trees. Over time, we expect long-term demand for well intervention services to increase due to the growing number of subsea tree installations. Historically, drilling rigs were typically necessary for subsea well intervention to troubleshoot or enhance production, shift sleeves, log wells or perform recompletions. Our well intervention vessels serve as work platforms for well intervention services at costs that historically have been less than offshore drilling rigs. Competitive advantages of our vessels are derived from their lower operating costs, together with an ability to mobilize quickly and to maximize operational time by performing a broad range of tasks related to intervention, construction, inspection, repair and maintenance. These services provide a cost advantage in the development and management of subsea reservoirs. We expect demand for our services to increase due to potential efficiency gains from our specialized intervention assets and equipment.

5

Our well intervention business currently operates six vessels providing services primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, the North Sea and West Africa.

The Q4000 has worked as a rigless riser-based intervention vessel in increasingly deeper water in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010, the Q4000 served as a key emergency response vessel in the Macondo well control and containment efforts. The Q4000 also serves an important role in the HFRS that was originally established in 2011. Our Q5000 semi-submersible well intervention vessel commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in late 2015. The vessel went on contracted rates in May 2016 under our five-year contract with BP.

In Brazil, we provide well intervention services to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”) with two monohull vessels, the Siem Helix 1 and the Siem Helix 2, that we charter from Siem Offshore AS (“Siem”). The initial term of the agreements with Petrobras is for four years from commencement of operations with options to extend by agreement of both parties for an additional period of up to four years. The Siem Helix 1 commenced operations for Petrobras in mid-April 2017 and the Siem Helix 2 commenced operations for Petrobras in mid-December 2017. The initial term of the charter agreements with Siem is for seven years from the respective vessel delivery dates with options to extend.

In the North Sea, the Well Enhancer has performed well intervention, abandonment and coil tubing services since it joined our fleet in 2009. The Seawell has provided well intervention and abandonment services since 1987, and the vessel underwent major capital upgrades in 2015 to extend its estimated useful economic life by approximately 15 years. Our North Sea well intervention fleet also performs services in West Africa from time to time.

We currently have a newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessel under completion, the Q7000. The vessel is built to North Sea standards. Pursuant to the shipyard contract and subsequent amendments, 20% of the contract price was paid upon the signing of the contract in 2013, 20% was paid in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the remaining 20% will be paid upon the delivery of the vessel, which at our option can be deferred until December 31, 2019.

Robotics

We have been actively engaged in robotics for over three decades. We operate ROVs, trenchers and ROVDrills designed for offshore construction, maintenance and well intervention services, and often integrate these services with chartered vessels. As global marine construction support operates in deeper waters, the use and scope of ROV services has expanded. Our chartered vessels add value by supporting deployment of our ROVs and trenchers. We provide our customers with vessel availability and schedule flexibility to meet the technological challenges of their subsea activities worldwide. Our robotics assets include 46 ROVs, five trenching systems and one ROVDrill. Our robotics business unit primarily operates in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea, West Africa and Asia Pacific regions. We charter vessels on a long-term basis to support our robotics operations. We also engage spot vessels on short-term charter agreements as needed. Vessels currently under long-term charter agreements include the Grand Canyon, the Grand Canyon II and the Grand Canyon III. We returned the Deep Cygnus to its owner during the first quarter of 2018.

Over the last decade there has been an increase in offshore activity associated with the growing alternative (renewable) energy industry. Specifically there has been an increase in demand for services to support the offshore wind farm industry. As the level of activity for offshore alternative energy projects has increased, so has the need for reliable services and related equipment. Historically, this work was performed with the use of barges and other similar vessels, but these types of services are now being contracted to vessels such as our Grand Canyon and Grand Canyon III chartered vessels that are suitable for harsh offshore weather conditions, especially in Northern Europe where offshore wind farming is currently concentrated. In 2018, revenues derived from offshore renewables contracts accounted for 33% of our global robotics revenues. We believe that over the long term our robotics business unit is positioned to continue the services it provides to a range of clients in the alternative energy industry. This is expected to include the use of our chartered vessels, ROVs and trenchers to provide burial services relating to subsea power cable installations on key wind farm developments.

Production Facilities

We own the HP I, a ship-shaped dynamically positioned floating production vessel capable of processing up to 45,000 barrels of oil and 80 million cubic feet (“MMcf”) of natural gas per day. The HP I has been under contract to the Phoenix field operator since February 2013 and is currently under a fixed fee agreement through at least June 1, 2023.

We own a 20% interest in Independence Hub, which owns the Independence Hub platform located in 8,000 feet of water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

We developed the HFRS in 2011 as a culmination of our experience as a responder in the 2010 Macondo well control and containment efforts. The HFRS centers on our vessels currently operating in the Gulf of Mexico, the HP I , the Q4000 and the Q5000, combining them with certain well control equipment that can be deployed to respond to a well control incident. On January 16, 2019, we renewed the agreements that provide various operators with access to the HFRS for well control purposes through March 31, 2020. These agreements automatically renew on an annual basis absent proper notice of termination by one of the parties.

On January 18, 2019, we purchased from Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon Oil”) certain operating depths associated with the Droshky Prospect on offshore Gulf of Mexico Green Canyon Block 244, along with several wells and related infrastructure. As part of the transaction, Marathon Oil will pay us certain agreed upon amounts for the required plug and abandonment of the acquired assets, which we can perform as our schedules permit subject to regulatory timelines.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

We primarily operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions. See Note 13 for revenues as well as property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, by geographic location.
CUSTOMERS

Our customers include major and independent oil and gas producers and suppliers, pipeline transmission companies, alternative (renewable) energy companies and offshore engineering and construction firms. The level of services required by any particular customer depends, in part, on the size of that customer’s budget in a particular year. Consequently, customers that account for a significant portion of revenues in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenues in subsequent fiscal years. The percentages of consolidated revenues from major customers, those whose total represented 10% or more of our consolidated revenues is as follows: 2018 — Petrobras (28%) and BP (15%), 2017 — BP (19%), Petrobras (13%) and Talos (10%), and 2016 — BP (17%) and Shell (11%). We provided services to over 50 customers in 2018.
COMPETITION

The oilfield services industry is highly competitive. While price is a factor, the ability to access specialized vessels, attract and retain skilled personnel, and demonstrate a good safety record is also important to competing in the industry. Our principal competitors in the well intervention business include Island Offshore Subsea AS, Wild Well Control, Oceaneering International, Inc., Expro Group and international drilling contractors. Our principal competitors in the robotics business include C-Innovation, LLC, DeepOcean Group, DOF Subsea Group, Fugro N.V. and Oceaneering International, Inc. Our competitors may have significantly more financial, personnel, technological and other resources available to them.
TRAINING, SAFETY, HEALTH, ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

Our corporate vision of a zero incident workplace is based on the belief that all incidents should be preventable and that we can adjust our working conditions to drive safer behaviors. Helix strives to achieve this by focusing on controlling major hazard risks and managing behavior. We have established a corporate culture in which QHSE has equal priority to our other business objectives. Should QHSE be in conflict with business objectives, then QHSE will take priority. Everyone at Helix has the authority and the duty to “STOP WORK” they believe is unsafe.

7

Our QHSE management systems and training programs were developed by management personnel based on common industry work practices and by employees with on-site experience who understand the risk and physical challenges of the ocean work site. As a result, we believe that our QHSE programs are among the best in the industry. We maintain a company-wide effort to continuously improve our control of QHSE risks and the behavior of our employees.

The process includes the assessment of risk through the use of selected risk analysis tools, control of work through management system procedures, job risk assessment of all routine and non-routine tasks, documentation of all daily observations, collection of data and data treatment to provide the mechanism for understanding our QHSE risks and at-risk behaviors. In addition, we schedule hazard hunts on each vessel and regularly audit QHSE management systems; both are completed with assigned responsibilities and action due dates.

The management systems of our business units have been independently assessed and registered compliant to ISO 9001 (Quality Management Systems) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems). All of our safety management systems are created in accordance with and conform to OHSAS 18001.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Overview

We provide services primarily in deepwater in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea, Asia Pacific and West Africa regions, and as such we are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including international treaties, flag state requirements, environmental laws and regulations, requirements for obtaining operating and navigation licenses, local content requirements, and other national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which our vessels and other assets operate or are registered, all of which can significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels and other assets. In 2019, we acquired four end of life offshore oil and gas wells, two of which are currently producing, which we will ultimately decommission. Being an operator of these wells subjects us to additional regulatory oversight from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”).
International Conventions

Our vessels are subject to applicable international maritime convention requirements, which include, but are not limited to, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”), the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage of 2001 (ratified in 2008), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (“SOLAS”), the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (the “ISM Code”), the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (the “MODU Code”), and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the “BWM Convention”). These regimes are applicable in most countries where we operate; however, the flag state and the country where we operate may impose additional requirements. In addition, these conventions impose liability for certain environmental discharges, including strict liability in some cases.

U.S. Overview

In the U.S., we are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard (the “Coast Guard”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) as well as state environmental protection agencies for those jurisdictions in which we operate, three divisions of the U.S. Department of the Interior, BOEM, BSEE, the Office of Natural Resource Revenue, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”), as well as classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (the “ABS”). We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety for our land-based operations.

8

International Overview

While we provide services globally and generally can be subject to local laws and regulations wherever we operate, the regulatory regimes of the U.K. and Brazil are of particular importance given the locations of our current operations. The U.K. Continental Shelf in the North Sea is regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority (the “OGA”) in accordance with the Petroleum Act 1998. The OGA controls all of the Petroleum Operations Notices with which we comply for various well intervention and subsea construction projects, as required. The OGA also regulates the environmental requirements for our operations in the North Sea. We comply as required by the Oil Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations 2005. In the North Sea, international regulations govern working hours and the working environment, as well as standards for diving procedures, equipment and diver health. We also note that the U.K.’s 2016 decision to exit from the EU may result in the imposition of new laws, rules or regulations affecting operations inside U.K. territorial waters.

Our operations in Brazil are predominantly regulated by the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels, the federal government agency responsible for the regulation of the oil sector. Additional regulatory oversight is provided, among others, by the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, which oversees Brazilian environmental legislation, implements the National Environmental Policy and exercises control and supervision of the use of natural resources, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency, which regulates products and services subject to health regulations, and the Ministry of Labor, which regulates a variety of subjects including accident prevention to use of machinery and equipment.

Operating Certification

Each of our vessels is subject to regulatory requirements of the country in which the vessel is registered, the flag state. In addition, the country where the vessel is operating may have its own requirements with respect to safety and environmental protections. These requirements must be satisfied in order for the vessel to operate. Flag state requirements are largely established by international treaties such as SOLAS, MARPOL, the ISM Code and the MODU Code, and in some instances, specific requirements of the flag state. These include engineering, safety, safe manning and other requirements related to the maritime industry. Each of our vessels must also maintain its “in-class” status with a classification society, evidencing that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable flag state rules and applicable international conventions. Our vessels generally must undergo a class survey once every five years. In the U.S., the Coast Guard sets safety standards and is authorized to investigate vessel and other marine casualty incidents, recommend improved safety standards, and inspect vessels at will. We also adhere to manning requirements implemented by the Coast Guard for operations on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”).
Cabotage Rules

A number of jurisdictions where we operate require that certain work performed there may only be performed by vessels built and/or registered in that jurisdiction. In some instances, an exemption may be available, or we may be subject to an additional tax to use a non-local vessel. In the U.S., we are subject to the Coastwise Merchandise Statute (commonly known as the “Jones Act”), which provides that only vessels built in the U.S., owned 75% by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizen seafarers may transport merchandise between points in the U.S. The Jones Act has been applied to offshore oil and gas work in the U.S. through interpretations by the CBP.
BOEM and BSEE

The operation of oil and gas properties located on the OCS is regulated primarily by BOEM and BSEE. Among other requirements, BOEM requires lessees of OCS properties to post bonds or provide other adequate financial assurance in connection with the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the removal of all production facilities. Our business is affected by laws and regulations as well as changing tax laws and policies relating to the oil and gas industry in general. Following the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010, BSEE determined and implemented enhanced standards for companies engaged in the development of offshore oil and gas wells. As an operator of wells, we are also required to have a BSEE-approved Oil Spill Response Plan. In April 2016, BSEE issued the final Oil and Gas and Sulfur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf-Blowout Preventer Systems and Well Control Rule, which updated requirements for equipment and operations for well control activities associated with drilling, completion, workover and decommissioning operations, and further provides guidance for the design and operation of remotely operated tools. On May 11, 2018, BSEE proposed to further revise the 
9

regulations for well control and blowout preventer systems in response to Executive and Secretarial Orders directing BSEE to review regulations that potentially burden development or use of domestically produced energy resources. The proposed rule would revise requirements for well design, well control, casing, cementing, real time monitoring, and subsea containment. Overall, the rulemaking would modify regulations that impact offshore oil and gas drilling, completions, workovers, and decommissioning activities.

Local Content Requirements

Governments in some countries, notably in Brazil and in the West Africa region, have become increasingly active in establishing and enforcing local content requirements with respect to equipment and crews utilized in operations such as ours, along with other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their respective countries.
Other Regulatory Impact

Additional proposals and proceedings before various international, federal and state regulatory agencies and courts could affect the oil and gas industry, including curtailing production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Overview

Our operations are subject to a variety of national (including federal, state and local) and international laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce these laws that are often complex, costly to comply with, and carry substantial administrative, civil and possibly criminal penalties for compliance failure. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by the government agencies with authority over environmental regulation. Under these laws and regulations, we may be liable for remediation or removal costs, damages, civil, criminal, administrative penalties and other costs associated with releases of hazardous materials (including oil) into the environment, and that liability may be imposed on us even if the acts that resulted in the releases were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those acts were performed. Some of the environmental laws and regulations that are applicable to our business operations are discussed in the following paragraphs, but the discussion does not cover all environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations.
MARPOL

The United States is one of approximately 170 member countries party to the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”), an agency of the United Nations responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. The IMO has negotiated MARPOL, which imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry, relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage, and air emissions.
OPA 90

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), imposes a variety of requirements on offshore facility owners or operators, and the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located, as well as owners and operators of vessels. Any of these entities or persons can be “responsible parties” and are strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills. Failure to comply with OPA may result in the assessment of civil, administrative and criminal penalties. In addition, OPA requires owners and operators of vessels over 300 gross tons to provide the Coast Guard with evidence of financial responsibility to cover the cost of cleaning up oil spills from those vessels. A number of foreign jurisdictions also require us to present satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility. We satisfy these requirements through appropriate insurance coverage.

10

Water Pollution

For operations in the U.S., the Clean Water Act imposes controls on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States and imposes potential liability for the costs of remediating releases of petroleum and other substances. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The EPA issues Vessel General Permits (“VGPs”) covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of each deficiency. Additionally, certain state regulations and VGPs prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the exploration for, and production of, oil and natural gas into certain coastal and offshore waters. Many states have laws that are analogous to the Clean Water Act and also require remediation of releases of petroleum and other hazardous substances in state waters. Internationally, the BWM Convention covers mandatory ballast water exchange requirements.
Air Pollution and Emissions

A variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives focused on restricting the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases apply to the jurisdictions in which we operate. Annex VI of MARPOL addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide, and requires the use of low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Beginning in 2010, the IMO designated the waters off North America as an Emission Control Area, meaning that vessels operating in the United States must use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Directives have been issued designed to reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. These can impact both the fuel and the engines that may be used onboard vessels. EU Regulation 2015/757 requires monitoring and reporting of the emissions of vessels exceeding 5,000 gross tons that call at EU ports, with the first reports due in 2019. It is anticipated that in the future the EU may move from requiring reporting of emissions to regulations aimed at reducing them.
CERCLA

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) requires the remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons, including owners and operators of contaminated sites where the release occurred and those companies that transport, dispose of or arrange for the disposal of, hazardous substances released at the sites.
OCSLA

The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended (“OCSLA”), provides the federal government with broad authority to impose environmental protection requirements applicable to lessees and permittees operating in the OCS. Specific design and operational standards may apply to OCS vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions that could curtail operations and cancellation of leases.
Current Compliance and Potential Material Impact

We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject. We maintain a robust operational compliance program to ensure that we maintain and update our programs to meet or exceed regulatory requirements in the areas in which we operate. We do not anticipate that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, changes in environmental laws and regulations, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and thus there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future. Environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and could have a significant impact on our financial ability to carry out our operations.

11

INSURANCE MATTERS

Our businesses involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and the suspension of operations. Damages arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As discussed below, we maintain insurance policies to cover some of our risk of loss associated with our operations. We maintain the amount of insurance we believe is prudent based on our estimated loss potential. However, not all of our business activities can be insured at the levels we desire because of either limited market availability or unfavorable economics (i.e., limited coverage considering the underlying cost).

Our current insurance program is valid until June 30, 2020.

We maintain Hull and Increased Value insurance, which provides coverage for physical damage up to an agreed amount for each vessel. The deductibles are $1.0 million on the Q4000, the Q5000, the HP I and the Well Enhancer, and $500,000 on the Seawell. In addition to the primary deductibles, the vessels are subject to an annual aggregate deductible of $5 million. We also carry Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance, which covers liabilities arising from the operation of the vessels, and General Liability insurance, which covers liabilities arising from construction operations. The deductible on both the P&I and General Liability is $100,000 per occurrence. Onshore employees are covered by Workers’ Compensation. Offshore employees and marine crews are covered by a Maritime Employers Liability (“MEL”) insurance policy, which covers Jones Act exposures and includes a deductible of $100,000 per occurrence plus a $750,000 annual aggregate deductible. In addition to the liability policies described above, we currently carry various layers of Umbrella Liability for total limits of $500 million in excess of primary limits as well as OPA insurance for our newly-acquired offshore properties with $35 million of coverage as required by BOEM. Our self-insured retention on our medical and health benefits program for employees is $300,000 per participant.

We also maintain Operator Extra Expense coverage that provides up to $150 million of coverage per each loss occurrence for a well control issue. Separately, we also maintain $500 million of liability insurance and $150 million of oil pollution insurance. For any given oil spill event we have up to $650 million of insurance coverage.

We customarily have agreements with our customers and vendors in which each contracting party is responsible for its respective personnel. Under these agreements we are indemnified against third party claims related to the injury or death of our customers’ or vendors’ personnel, and vice versa. With respect to well work contracted to us, the customer is generally contractually responsible for pollution emanating from the well. We separately maintain additional coverage for an amount up to $100 million that would cover us under certain circumstances against any such third party claims associated with well control events.

We incur workers’ compensation, MEL and other insurance claims in the normal course of business. We analyze each claim for potential exposure and estimate the ultimate liability of each claim. We have not incurred any significant losses as a result of claims denied by our insurance carriers. Our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur, and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events, or that such insurance will continue to be available at current levels of cost or coverage, we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations.

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

Defined below are certain terms helpful to understanding our business that are located through this Annual Report:

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM):  BOEM is responsible for managing environmentally and economically responsible development of the U.S. offshore resources. Its functions include offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies.

Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE):  BSEE is responsible for safety and environmental oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, including permitting and inspections of offshore oil and gas operations. Its functions include the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting offshore exploration, development and production, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs.

Deepwater:  Water depths exceeding 1,000 feet.

Dynamic Positioning (DP):  Computer directed thruster systems that use satellite based positioning and other positioning technologies to ensure the proper counteraction to wind, current and wave forces enabling a vessel to maintain its position without the use of anchors.

DP2:  Two DP systems on a single vessel providing the redundancy that allows the vessel to maintain position even with the failure of one DP system.

DP3:  Triple-redundant DP control system comprising a triple-redundant controller unit and three identical operator stations. The system has to withstand fire or flood in any one compartment without the system failing. Loss of position should not occur from any single failure, including a completely burnt fire subdivision or flooded watertight compartment.

Intervention Riser System (IRS):  A subsea system that establishes a direct connection from a well intervention vessel, through a rigid riser, to a conventional or horizontal subsea tree in depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The system can be utilized for wireline intervention, production logging, coiled-tubing operations, well stimulation, and full plug and abandonment operations. The system provides the well control in order to safely access the well bore for these activities.

13

Life of Field Services:  Services performed on offshore facilities, trees and pipelines from the beginning to the end of the economic life of an oil field, including installation, inspection, maintenance, repair, well intervention and abandonment.

QHSE:  Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental programs to protect the environment, safeguard employee health and avoid injuries.

Pound Per Square Inch (p.s.i.):  A unit of measurement for pressure or stress resulting from a force of one pound-force applied to an area of one square inch.

Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (ROAM):  An 18¾-inch large bore system that enhances well abandonment capabilities from a well intervention vessel.

Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV):  A robotic vehicle used to complement, support and increase the efficiency of diving and subsea operations and for tasks beyond the capability of manned diving operations.

ROVDrill:  ROV deployed coring system developed to take advantage of existing ROV technology. The coring package, deployed with the ROV system, is capable of taking cores from the seafloor in water depths up to 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). Because the ROV system operates from the seafloor there is no need for surface drilling strings and the larger support spreads required for conventional coring.

Saturation Diving:  Saturation diving, required for work in water depths between 200 and 1,000 feet, involves divers working from special chambers for extended periods at a pressure equivalent to the pressure at the work site.

Spot Vessels:  Vessels not owned or under long-term charter but contracted on a short-term basis to perform specific projects.

Subsea Intervention Lubricator (SIL):  A riserless system that facilitates access to subsea wells from a monohull vessel to provide safe, efficient and cost effective riserless well intervention and abandonment solutions. The system can be utilized for wireline, logging, light perforating, zone isolation, plug setting and removal, and decommissioning. The system provides access to the well bore while providing full well control safety for activities that do not require a riser conduit.

Tension Leg Platform (TLP):  A floating production facility anchored to the seabed with tendons.

Trencher or Trencher System:  A subsea robotics system capable of providing post lay trenching, inspection and burial (PLIB) and maintenance of submarine cables and flowlines in water depths of 30 to 7,200 feet across a range of seabed and environmental conditions.

Well Intervention Services:  Activities related to well maintenance and production management/enhancement services. Our well intervention operations include the utilization of slickline and electric line services, pumping services, specialized tooling and coiled tubing services.
