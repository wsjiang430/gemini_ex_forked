Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

The Company
 We are an externally managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed as a Maryland corporation in 2007 to acquire and hold commercial real estate properties throughout the United States, substantially all of which are leased to the properties’ operators under long-term net leases. Under a “net lease,” the tenant occupying the leased property (usually as a single tenant) does so in much the same manner as if the tenant were the owner of the property. There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple-net or double-net. Triple-net leases typically require that the tenant pay all expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs, and capital costs). Double-net leases typically require that the tenant pay all operating expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance), but exclude some or all major repairs (e.g., roof, structure, and parking lot). Accordingly, the owner receives the rent “net” of these expenses, rendering the cash flow associated with the lease predictable for the term of the lease. Under a net lease, the tenant generally agrees to lease the property for a significant term and agrees that it will either have no ability, or only limited ability, to terminate the lease or abate rent prior to the expiration of the term of the lease as a result of real estate driven events such as casualty, condemnation, or failure by the landlord to fulfill its obligations under the lease. 
 We focus on real estate that is operated by a single tenant where the real estate is an integral part of the tenant’s business. Our diversified portfolio of real estate includes retail properties (such as quick service and casual dining restaurants), healthcare facilities, industrial manufacturing facilities, warehouse and distribution centers, and corporate offices, among others. We target properties with creditworthy tenants that look to engage in a long-term lease relationship. Through long-term leases, our tenants are able to retain operational control of their mission critical locations, while conserving their debt and equity capital to fund their fundamental business operations. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned a diversified portfolio of 621 individual net leased commercial properties located in 42 states and comprising approximately 19.0 million rentable square feet of operational space. As of December 31, 2018, 100% of our properties were subject to leases and were 99.7% occupied by 161 different commercial tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than 3.5% of our contractual rental revenue over the next 12 months (“NTM Rent”). 
 We elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2008. As a REIT, we are not subject to federal income tax to the extent that we meet certain requirements, including that we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income to our stockholders and satisfy other requirements based on the composition of our asset portfolio and sources of income. 
 We operate under the direction of our board of directors, which is responsible for the management and control of our affairs. Our board of directors has retained Broadstone Real Estate, LLC (the “Manager”), to provide certain property management services for our properties, and Broadstone Asset Management, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Manager (the “Asset Manager”), to manage our day-to-day affairs and implement our investment strategy, subject to our board of directors’ direction, oversight, and approval. The agreements governing the services provided by the Manager and the Asset Manager have been renewed through the year ending December 31, 2021, and will automatically renew for successive additional three-year terms thereafter, subject to earlier termination as detailed in the respective agreements. 
 We conduct substantially all of our activities through, and all of our properties are held directly or indirectly by, the Operating Company. We are the sole managing member of the Operating Company and as of December 31, 2018, we owned approximately 92.7% of its issued and outstanding membership units, with the remaining 7.3% of its membership units held by persons who were issued membership units in exchange for their interests in properties acquired by the Operating Company.

As we conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Company, we are structured as what is referred to as an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (“UPREIT”). The UPREIT structure allows a property owner to contribute property to the Operating Company in exchange for membership units in the Operating Company and generally defer taxation of a resulting gain until the contributor later disposes of the membership units or the property is sold in a taxable transaction. The membership units of the Operating Company held by members of the Operating Company other than us are referred to herein and in our consolidated financial statements as “non-controlling interests,” “non-controlling membership units,” or “membership units,” and are convertible into shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to certain restrictions. We allocate consolidated earnings to holders of our common stock and non-controlling membership unit holders of the Operating Company based on the weighted average number of shares of our common stock and non-controlling membership units outstanding during the year. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the weighted average number of units outstanding was 1.67 million.
 We commenced our ongoing private offering of shares of our common stock (our “private offering”) in 2007. The first closing of our private offering occurred on December 31, 2007, and we have conducted additional closings at least once every calendar quarter since then. Currently, we close sales of additional shares of our common stock monthly. In November 2017, we instituted a monthly equity cap and queue program for new and additional investments in our common stock. The cap does not apply to investments made pursuant to our Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) or equity capital received in connection with UPREIT transactions. See Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities” of this Form 10-K for further information.
 Shares of our common stock are offered in our private offering at a price equal to a determined share value (the “Determined Share Value”), which is established at least quarterly by the committee of our board of directors comprised of our independent directors (“Independent Directors Committee”) based on the net asset value (“NAV”) of our portfolio, input from management and third-party consultants, and other such factors as the Independent Directors Committee may determine. Our determination of NAV applies valuation definitions and methodologies prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, in order to fair value our net assets. Our net assets are primarily comprised of our investment in rental property and debt, as well as other assets and liabilities such as cash, interest rate swaps, and accounts payable. The values ascribed to our mortgages, unsecured notes, and interest rate swaps are marked to market each quarter. See further discussion related to Determined Share Value in Item 5. “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Form 10-K under the caption Determined Share Value. Shares of our common stock are currently being offered in our private offering at $85.00 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we issued 3.22 million shares of our common stock in our private offering, including 0.64 million shares of common stock issued pursuant to our DRIP. Cash received for newly issued shares totaled $215.7 million and shares with a value of $52.2 million were issued pursuant to DRIP transactions. In addition, we issued 194,035 units in our Operating Company valued at $15.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, in exchange for properties contributed through UPREIT transactions. We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our private offering, supplemented with additional borrowings, to continue to invest in additional net leased properties and for general corporate purposes. We conduct our private offering in reliance upon the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), provided by Rule 506(c) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 
 As of December 31, 2018, there were 22,013,751 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, and 1,737,047 non-controlling membership units in the Operating Company issued and outstanding.

 FFO and AFFO are performance measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We present these non-GAAP measures as we believe certain investors and other users of our financial information use them as part of their evaluation of our historical operating performance. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K under the heading Net Income and Non-GAAP Measures (FFO and AFFO), which includes discussion of the definition, purpose, and use of these non-GAAP measures as well as a reconciliation of each to the most comparable GAAP measure.

Our Properties and Investment Objectives 
 We target acquisitions of fee simple interests in individual properties priced between $5 million and $75 million. Portfolios may be significantly larger, depending on balance sheet capacity and whether the portfolio is diversified or concentrated by tenant, geography, or brand. Our investment policy (“Investment Policy”) has three primary objectives: 

• | preserve, protect, and return capital to investors,
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | realize increased cash available for distributions and long-term capital appreciation from growth in the value of our properties, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximize the level of sustainable cash distributions to our investors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 We primarily acquire freestanding, single-tenant commercial properties located in the United States either directly from our creditworthy tenants in sale-leaseback transactions, where they sell us their properties and simultaneously lease them back through long-term, net leases, or through the purchase of properties already under a net lease (i.e., a lease assumption). Under either scenario, our properties are generally under lease and fully occupied at the time of acquisition. Our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2018, is reflective of our Investment Policy, with a focus on properties in growth markets with at least ten years of lease term remaining that are expected to achieve financial returns on equity of greater than 9.5%, net of fees, calculated based on the average return recognized across all acquisitions during a calendar year, provided that all acquisitions must have a minimum remaining lease term of seven years and a minimum return on equity of 8.5%, net of fees, unless otherwise approved by the Independent Directors Committee. Our criteria for selecting properties are based on the following underwriting principles: 
  
• | fundamental value and characteristics of the underlying real estate,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creditworthiness of the tenant, and
--+------------------------------------


• | transaction structure and pricing.
--+-----------------------------------

 We believe we can achieve an appropriate risk-adjusted return through these underwriting principles and conservatively project a property’s potential to generate targeted returns from current and future cash flows. We believe targeted returns are achieved through a combination of in-place income at the time of acquisition, rent growth, and a property’s potential for appreciation. 
 To achieve an appropriate risk-adjusted return, we maintain a diversified portfolio of real estate spread across multiple tenants, industries, and geographic locations. The following charts summarize our portfolio diversification by property type, tenant industry, and geographic location as of December 31, 2018. The percentages below are calculated based on our NTM Rent as of December 31, 2018, divided by total NTM Rent. Late payments, non-payments, or other unscheduled payments are not considered in the calculation. NTM Rent includes the impact of contractual rent escalations.

At December 31, 2018, all of our properties are subject to leases, substantially all of which were net leases. We do not currently engage in the development of real estate, which could cause a delay in timing between the funds used to invest in properties and the corresponding cash inflows from rental receipts. Our cash flows from operations are primarily generated through our real estate investment portfolio and the monthly lease payments under our long-term leases with our tenants. 
 To mitigate the impact of inflation on our fixed revenue streams and increase value to our stockholders, we strive to implement periodic rent escalations within our leases. As of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our leases had contractual rent escalations, with an annual weighted average of 2.0%. A majority of our leases have fixed annual rent increases, and the remaining leases have annual lease escalations based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), or periodic escalations over the term of the lease (e.g., a 10% increase every five years). These lease escalations mitigate the risk of earnings erosion on our fixed revenue streams in the case of an inflationary economic environment, and provide increased return in otherwise stable market conditions. Our focus on single-tenant, net leases shifts certain risks to the tenant and shelters us from volatility in the cost of taxes, insurance, services, and maintenance of the property. For a portion of our portfolio, we have leases that are not fully triple-net, and, therefore, we bear responsibility for certain maintenance and structural component replacements (e.g., roof, structure, or parking lot) that may be required in the future, although the tenants are still required to pay all operating expenses associated with the property (e.g., real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance). In circumstances where we cannot implement a triple-net lease, we attempt to limit our exposure through the use of warranties and other remedies that reduce the likelihood of a significant capital outlay during the term of the lease. We will also occasionally incur other property-level expenses that are not paid by our tenants. We do not currently anticipate making significant capital expenditures or incurring other significant property costs on an aggregate basis during the term of the property leases in our current portfolio. 
 Due to the fact that substantially all of our properties are leased under long-term leases, we are not currently required to perform significant ongoing leasing activities on our properties. The leases for eight of our properties, representing less than 1% of our annual rental streams (calculated based on NTM Rent), will expire before 2021. As of December 31, 2018, the weighted average remaining term of our leases (calculated based on NTM Rent) was approximately 12.1 years, excluding renewal options, which are exercisable at the option of our tenants upon expiration of their base lease term. Approximately 5% of the properties in our portfolio are subject to leases without at least one renewal option. Furthermore, the weighted average remaining lease term on the $606.8 million in properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018, was 11.0 years at the time of acquisition. More than 55% of our rental revenue is derived from leases that expire during 2030 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2018, no more than 9% of our rental revenue is derived from leases that expire in any single year in the next ten years. The following chart sets forth our lease expirations based upon the terms of our leases in place as of December 31, 2018.

Our Investment Policy generally requires us to seek diversification of our investments. Based on the NTM Rent of the properties in the portfolio, determined as of the date of the prior quarter end, new investments may not cause us to exceed: 
  
• | 5% in any single property;
--+---------------------------


• | 8% leased to any single tenant or brand;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | 10% located in any single metropolitan statistical area; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20% located in any single state.
--+---------------------------------

 We may exceed these diversification targets from time to time with the approval of the Independent Directors Committee. To avoid undue risk concentrations in any single asset class or category, long-term asset allocation will be set with the following target percentages and within the following ranges, although these ranges may be temporarily waived by the Independent Directors Committee: 
 
 
Asset Category | Target | Range 
---------------+--------+-------
Retail | 30% | 15-45%
Healthcare | 20% | 15-45%
Industrial | 25% | 15-45%
Office | 15% | 10-20%
Other | 10% | 5-15% 

 
While the Independent Directors Committee establishes diversification thresholds to manage risk, the management team does not review discrete financial information at this level. Refer to our discussion regarding segment reporting under the caption Segment Reporting in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. 
 We do not currently engage in the development of real estate, but may do so in the future. Our Investment Policy provides the Asset Manager with the authority to make, on our behalf, and without approval of the Independent Directors Committee: (i) any acquisition or sale transaction of any property or portfolio of related properties involving a purchase or sale price up to $100 million, and (ii) any acquisition of an individual property or portfolio of properties that would result in less than a 4% concentration in any tenant or less than a 5% concentration in any brand, each on an NTM Rent basis, provided that the transaction otherwise meets our Investment Policy, and any financing related to any such acquisition does not violate our Leverage Policy (as defined below), as established by the Independent Directors Committee from time to time. In addition to the foregoing thresholds, individual property and portfolio acquisitions that do not meet the criteria set forth in the Investment Policy must be approved by the Independent Directors Committee: (i) for individual property acquisitions, when the purchase price exceeds $15 million, and (ii) for portfolio acquisitions, where one or more of the properties included in the portfolio do not meet the criteria set forth in the Investment Policy, when the aggregate purchase price allocated in the transaction to those non-conforming properties exceeds $15 million. For any calendar year, the aggregate amount of non-conforming properties that may be acquired pursuant to these latter terms, is limited to an aggregate amount, based on purchase price, equal to 1.5% of the approximate market value of our assets as measured as of the first day of the calendar year.  
 Underwriting Criteria 
 When evaluating a property acquisition, our underwriting guidelines require that we consider the condition of the property, the creditworthiness of the tenant, the strength of any personal or corporate guarantees, the tenant’s historic performance at the property or similar properties, the location of the property, the overall economic condition of the community in which the property is located, and the property’s potential for appreciation. We apply our credit underwriting guidelines prior to acquiring a property, periodically throughout the lease term, and when we are re-leasing properties in our portfolio. While we seek creditworthy tenants, we do not require them to be investment grade credit rated. Our credit review process includes analyzing a tenant’s financial statements and other available information. When we obtain guarantees on our leases, we also analyze the creditworthiness of the guarantors. Depending on the circumstances, our process will include discussions with the tenant’s management team surrounding their business plan and strategy. 
 12


We evaluate the creditworthiness of our existing tenants on an ongoing basis by holding regularly scheduled real estate portfolio reviews, reviewing updated tenant financial statements on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the terms of the lease, analyzing updated tenant credit ratings, and reviewing our ongoing analysis of the economy and trends in the industries in which our tenants operate. Our portfolio review committee, which includes members of our Manager’s senior management and asset and portfolio management teams, performs an in-depth review of each property in our portfolio at least once every 18 months. The review includes a review of real estate fundamentals and an analysis of the tenant’s recent financial statements, including key metrics such as rent coverage and leverage ratios, among other applicable credit metrics, credit ratings, and economic considerations relevant to the tenant. The Manager’s asset management team also periodically reviews tenant financial statements and relevant credit performance metrics. Our credit monitoring procedures also include regular communications with tenants, who are required to notify us of certain events under the terms of our leases, such as events of default and property damage. We believe our ongoing credit monitoring will enable us to identify material changes to a tenant’s credit quality in a timely basis and preserve our financial position. We have not identified any material changes to the credit quality of the tenants in our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2018. 
 Leverage Policy 
 Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) has assigned the Operating Company an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 with a stable outlook, which allows us to take advantage of preferential borrowing margins and provides more attractive access to the debt markets, including the debt private placement market. The Operating Company’s credit rating is based on a number of factors, including an assessment of our financial strength, portfolio size and diversification, credit and operating metrics, corporate governance policies, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. While Moody’s utilizes other factors outside of our leverage ratio in assigning ratings, we are strongly committed to maintaining a modest leverage profile commensurate with our investment grade rating. Our leverage policy (“Leverage Policy”) is to maintain a leverage ratio in the 35% to 45% range based on the approximate market value of our assets, recognizing that the actual leverage ratio may vary over time and there may be opportunistic reasons to exceed a 45% leverage ratio; provided, however, that we cannot exceed a 50% leverage ratio without the approval of the Independent Directors Committee. The Independent Directors Committee reviews our Leverage Policy at least annually; however, depending on market conditions and other factors, they may change our Leverage Policy from time to time.  
 We primarily utilize our unsecured revolving line of credit to finance acquisitions and manage our liquidity profile. Longer dated unsecured debt in the form of term loans and private placement notes are used as the primary sources of debt capital. Unsecured term loans are variable-rate debt for which we mitigate interest rate risk through the use of interest rate derivatives discussed below. The debt private placement market allows us to issue unsecured long-term, fixed-rate notes to help mitigate interest rate risk, lengthen our maturity profile, and diversify our sources of debt capital. The mix of financing sources may change over time based on market conditions. The unsecured borrowings generally contain affirmative and negative covenants which are tested against our financial performance. 
 While we do not use mortgage loans and notes payable (“mortgage financing”) as a strategic source of debt capital, we will occasionally utilize mortgage financing for a single property or a group of related properties acquired from a single seller. These loans may be further secured by guarantees from us, provided that we attempt to limit the use of guarantees to the extent possible. We may assume debt when conducting a transaction or we may mortgage existing properties. As of December 31, 2018, 11 of our 621 properties were secured by mortgage financing, and the aggregate outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans and notes payable was approximately $79.5 million. 
 To reduce our exposure to variable-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to fix the rate of interest as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate debt. These interest rate hedges have staggered maturities to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations in any one year, and generally extend up to 10 years. The interest rate swaps are applied against a pool of variable-rate debt, which offers flexibility in maintaining our hedge designation concurrent with our ongoing capital markets activity. We attempt to limit our total exposure to floating-rate debt to no more than 5% of the approximate market value of our assets, measured at quarter end.

To reduce counterparty concentration risk with respect to our interest rate hedges, we diversify the institutions that serve as swap counterparties, and no more than 30% of the nominal value of our total hedged debt may be with any one institution, to be measured at the time we enter into an interest rate swap transaction and at quarter end. 
 As of December 31, 2018, our total outstanding indebtedness was $1,450.6 million and the ratio of our total indebtedness to the approximate market value of our assets was 41.5%. 
 Corporate Governance 
 We operate under the direction of our board of directors, which is responsible for the management and control of our affairs. Our board of directors has retained the Manager and the Asset Manager to manage our day-to-day affairs, to implement our investment strategy, and to provide certain property management services for our properties, with both subject to our board of directors’ direction, oversight, and approval. All of our officers are employees of the Manager. 
 Our board of directors is currently comprised of nine directors, six of whom are independent directors and serve on the Independent Directors Committee. The Independent Directors Committee reviews our relationship with, and the performance of, the Manager and the Asset Manager, and approves the terms of any affiliate transactions. In addition, the Independent Directors Committee is responsible for, among other things, approving our property and portfolio valuation policy, setting the Determined Share Value for our ongoing private offering, approving and setting our Investment Policy and Leverage Policy, and approving acquisitions above certain thresholds or outside of the criteria set forth in our Investment Policy. 
 Management and Our Structure 
 Pursuant to the terms of the asset management agreement among us, the Operating Company, and the Asset Manager (as amended, the “Asset Management Agreement”), the Asset Manager is responsible for, among other things, managing our day-to-day operations, establishing and monitoring acquisition and disposition strategies, overseeing all marketing communications and services related to our ongoing private offering, arranging mortgage and other financing, overseeing the acquisition of properties and their initial lease-up if they are not already subject to a net lease upon acquisition, providing support for the good faith valuation of our property portfolio and the setting of the Determined Share Value by the Independent Directors Committee, overseeing investor closings and transfers, arranging our annual stockholder meetings, and servicing and communicating with investors, including providing investment projections and reports. The Asset Manager also has the power pursuant to the Asset Management Agreement to nominate two directors to serve on our board of directors. The Manager owns and controls the Asset Manager. 
 Pursuant to the property management agreement among us, the Operating Company, and the Manager (as amended, the “Property Management Agreement”), the Manager provides property management services to our properties, including management, rent collection, and re-leasing services. In June 2015, Trident BRE, LLC, an affiliate of Stone Point Capital LLC (“Trident BRE”), acquired through an equity investment an approximate 45.6% equity ownership interest in the Manager. As of December 31, 2018, the Manager is owned, on a fully diluted basis, (i) approximately 47.06% by Trident BRE, (ii) approximately 41.51% by Amy L. Tait, our Chairman of the board of directors, Tait family trusts, and an investment entity for the families of Ms. Tait and the late Norman Leenhouts, one of our founders, and (iii) approximately 11.43% by employees of the Manager. The Manager is controlled by a four-person board of managers, two of whom are appointed by Trident BRE. In June 2015, in connection with Trident BRE’s investment in the Manager, (i) we acquired 100,000 convertible preferred units in the Manager (the “Convertible Preferred BRE Units”), for $100 per Convertible Preferred BRE Unit, in exchange for the issuance to the Manager of 138,889 shares of our common stock, then valued at $72.00 per share, and (ii) the Manager purchased 510,416 shares of our common stock, for $72.00 per share. On July 31, 2018, we sold all of the Convertible Preferred BRE Units to Trident BRE for an aggregate sales price of $18.5 million. The Independent Directors Committee approved both the initial investment in and subsequent sale of the Convertible Preferred BRE Units. As of December 31, 2018, the Manager owned 359,553, or approximately 1.6%, of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.

As of December 31, 2018, the Manager employed approximately 21 individuals fully dedicated to our business and operations. Additionally, the Manager employed approximately 65 additional individuals who dedicate a significant portion of their time to our business and operations, in addition to various other tasks and responsibilities on behalf of the Manager and its affiliates. 
 For more information regarding the relationships among our company, Trident BRE, the Manager, and the Asset Manager and the fees we pay to the Manager and the Asset Manager pursuant to the Property Management Agreement and the Asset Management Agreement, see the captions Director Independence and Related Party Transactions and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions in our definitive proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Proxy Statement”), which will be filed with the SEC within 120 days following the end of our fiscal year, and are incorporated herein by reference.
 The chart below illustrates the relationships among our company, the Operating Company, the Manager, and the Asset Manager as of December 31, 2018.
 
Regulation 
 Our investments are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, and environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution, and indirect environmental impacts. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.

Emerging Growth Company Status 
 We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), and as such we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. A number of these exemptions are not currently relevant to us due to our external management structure. 
 In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (ii) the date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period, and (iv) the end of the year following the five-year anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock under an initial public offering. 
 Competition 
 The commercial real estate market is highly competitive. We compete for tenants to occupy our properties in all of our markets with other owners and operators of commercial real estate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs, and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates, and the operating expenses of certain of our properties. 
 In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and purchasers to buy our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, sovereign wealth funds, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies, and other entities. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have. The relative size of their portfolios may allow them to absorb properties with lower returns and allow them to accept more risk on a given property than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities may seek financing through similar channels to us. Competition from these REITs and other third-party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It also may result in higher prices, lower yields, and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms. 
 Seasonality 
 Our investments are not materially impacted by seasonality. 
 Employees 
 We have no employees. Our officers are employees of our Manager or its affiliates and are not compensated by us for their service as our officers. The employees of our Manager and its affiliates manage our day-to-day operations and provide management, acquisition, advisory, and certain administrative services for us.

Income Taxes 
 We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code and have operated as such commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2008. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain and does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. As a REIT, to the extent we satisfy this distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed amount. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. 
Financial Information about Industry Segments
