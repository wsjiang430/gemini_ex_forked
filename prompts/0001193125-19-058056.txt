Regulation and Supervision 
 General 
 As a bank holding company and a financial holding company, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board or Federal Reserve) as its primary federal regulator under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHC Act). The Company is required to file annual reports with the Federal Reserve and provide other information that the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may also make examinations and inspections of the Company. 
 The Bank, as an Indiana-chartered bank, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (DFI) as its primary state regulator. Also, as to certain matters, the Bank is under the supervision of, and subject to examination by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) because the FDIC provides deposit insurance to the Bank and is the Banks primary federal regulator. 
 The supervision, regulation and examination of Horizon and the Bank by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than for the benefit of Horizons shareholders. 
 Horizon is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. Horizons common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol HBNC, and Horizon is subject to the NASDAQ rules applicable to listed companies. 
 Included below is a brief summary of significant aspects of the laws, regulations and policies applicable to Horizon and the Bank. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations and policies that are referenced and is not intended to be an exhaustive description of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to the business of Horizon and the Bank. Also, such statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and by federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Horizon and the Bank could have a material effect on Horizons business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 The Bank Holding Company Act 
 The BHC Act generally limits the business in which a bank holding company and its subsidiaries may engage to banking or managing or controlling banks and those activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Those closely related activities currently can include such activities as consumer finance, mortgage banking and securities brokerage. Certain well-managed and well-capitalized bank holding companies may elect to be treated as a financial holding company and, as a result, will be permitted to engage in a broader range of activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are determined to be incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. Horizon has both qualified as, and elected to be, a financial holding company. Activities that are considered financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments.

 HORIZON BANCORP, INC. 
 
To commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 
 Federal Reserve Board policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, codified this policy. Under this requirement, Horizon is required to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances in which Horizon might not otherwise do so. For this purpose, source of financial strength means Horizons ability to provide financial assistance to the Bank in the event of the Banks financial distress. 
 The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act (which is the popular name for Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before a bank holding company may acquire more than a 5% voting interest or substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Banks must also seek prior approval from their primary state and federal regulators for any such acquisitions. In reviewing applications seeking approval for mergers and other acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicants performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized (as defined in FDICIA), with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. 
 Bank holding companies, such as Horizon, and their insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state regulators. The guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments to four risk weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk. For an additional discussion of the Companys regulatory capital ratios and regulatory requirements as of December 31, 2018, please refer to the subsection titled Capital Regulation in this Regulation and Supervision section. 
 Branching and Acquisitions 
 Indiana law, the BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act restrict certain types of expansion by the Company and the Bank. The Company and the Bank may be required to apply for prior approval from (or give prior notice and an opportunity for review to) the Federal Reserve, the DFI and the FDIC, and or other regulatory agencies as a condition to the acquisition or establishment of new offices, or the acquisition by merger, purchase or otherwise of the stock, business or assets of other banks or companies. 
 Under current law, Indiana chartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states, subject to certain limitations. Indiana law also authorizes an Indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other than Indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the acquisition of a branch. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state in which the new branch will be opened is no longer required.

Deposit Insurance and Assessments 
 The Banks deposits are insured to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. Generally, deposits are insured up to the statutory limit of $250,000. Banks are subject to deposit insurance premiums and assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured banks in order to achieve statutorily required reserve ratios in the DIF and to impose special additional assessments. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in significant changes to the FDICs deposit insurance system. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the DIF at no less than 1.35%, and must achieve the 1.35% designated reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations. The FDIC has set the long term goal for the designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits. 
 Also as a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums was changed in 2011 from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. The initial base assessment rates ranged from 5-35 basis points. For small Risk Category I banks, such as Horizon Bank, the rates ranged from 5-9 basis points. 
 Adjustments are made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and brokered deposits. 
 Effective as of June 30, 2016, the reserve ratio reached 1.15% and a new assessment rate schedule became effective July 1, 2016, with rates ranging from 3 to 30 basis points instead of 5 to 35 basis points. Assessment rates for all established smaller banks will be determined using financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years. The new pricing system eliminates risk categories, but establishes minimum and maximum assessment rates for established small banks based on a banks CAMELS composite ratings (i.e., capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity). 
 Horizons FDIC deposit insurance expense decreased $513,000 during 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of the new assessment rate schedule effective July 1, 2016. Horizons FDIC deposit insurance expense increased $398,000 during 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to an increase in average consolidated total assets. 
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. 
 FDIC-insured institutions are also subject to the requirement to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, an early predecessor of the DIF. The FICO bonds were scheduled to be repaid between 2017 and 2019, and the last bond is now scheduled to be repaid in September 2019. For 2018, the Bank paid 0.46 basis points for each $100 of insured deposits for the first quarter, 0.44 basis points for the second quarter, and 0.32 basis points for the third and fourth quarters. The assessment rate was further reduced to 0.14 basis points for the first quarter of 2019. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which is the agency authorized by Congress to prescribe regulations relating to FICO, recently adopted a final rule effective January 7, 2019, that projects that the last FICO assessment on institutions like Horizon Bank will be collected on the March 29, 2019, FDIC Quarterly Certified Statement Invoice.

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 
 Horizon and the Bank are subject to the Federal Reserve Act, which restricts financial transactions between banks, affiliated companies and their executive officers, including limits on credit transactions between these parties. The statute prescribes terms and conditions in order for bank affiliate transactions to be deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and it also restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a banks extension of credit to an affiliate. In general, extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and subject to credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliates, and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 
 Capital Regulation 
 The federal bank regulatory authorities have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for banks and bank holding companies that are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and account for off-balance sheet items. Generally, to satisfy the capital requirements, the Company must maintain capital sufficient to meet both risk-based asset ratio tests and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. Risk-based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into various risk-weighted categories, with higher weighting assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. A risk-based ratio represents the applicable measure of capital divided by total risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is a measure of the Companys core capital divided by total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. 
 The capital guidelines divide a bank holding companys or banks capital into two tiers. The first tier (Tier I) includes common equity, certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships, subject to certain limitations). Supplementary capital (Tier II) includes, among other items, cumulative perpetual and long-term limited-life preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, certain hybrid capital instruments, term subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses, subject to certain limitations, less required deductions. The regulations also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio designed to supplement the risk-based capital guidelines. This ratio is computed by dividing Tier I capital, net of all intangibles, by the quarterly average of total assets. Pursuant to the regulations, banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk, including the volume and severity of problem loans to which they are exposed. 
 Effective January 1, 2015 (subject to certain phase-in provisions through January 1, 2019), the Company became subject to new federal banking rules implementing changes arising from Dodd-Frank and the U.S. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, providing a capital framework for all U.S. banks and bank holding companies (Basel III). Basel III increased the minimum requirements for both the quantity and quality of capital held by Horizon and the Bank. The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total capital ratio of 8.0% (unchanged from prior rules) and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. The final rules also require a common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which is in addition to the other minimum risk-based capital standards in the rule. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital conservation buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of certain bonuses to senior executive management. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in over three years beginning in 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer requirement effectively raises the minimum required common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 7.0%, the Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5% and the total capital ratio to 10.5% on a fully phased-in basis. 
 Basel III also introduced other changes, including an increase in the capital required for certain categories of assets, including higher-risk construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations. Banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2010, such as Horizon, are permitted to retain non-qualifying Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010, subject generally to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital.

In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the Regulatory Relief Act) was enacted, which could change the regulatory capital requirements applicable to Horizon. The Regulatory Relief Act was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. Of particular significance for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, the Regulatory Relief Act directs the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8% to 10% to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the Community Bank Leverage Ratio will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios, and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be well-capitalized under the prompt correction action rules. 
 Horizons management believes that, as of December 31, 2018, Horizon and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules currently in effect. 
 The following is a summary of Horizons and the Banks regulatory capital and capital requirements at December 31, 2018.

--+----------------------------------

 The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries, except that bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets are exempt from these capital requirements. 
 Dividends 
 Horizon is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The primary source of Horizons cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on its common stock, is the payment of dividends to Horizon by the Bank. Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered appropriate by the Banks Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the DFI for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, retained net income means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. The Bank is generally exempt from this DFI pre-approval process for dividends if (i) the Bank has been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; (ii) the proposed dividend will not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and (iii) the Bank is not subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement or board approved operating agreement. 
 The FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank.

 HORIZON BANCORP, INC. 
 
In addition, under Federal Reserve supervisory policy, a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless (i) the organizations net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organizations capital needs, assets, quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve issued a letter dated February 24, 2009, to bank holding companies informing them that it expects bank holding companies to consult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e., such as when the dividend is not supported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate) and in advance of repurchasing shares of common stock or preferred stock. Although the effect of this letter was revised in December 2015 to become inapplicable to certain large U.S. bank holding companies (generally, those with at least $50 billion in average total consolidated assets), the guidance remains effective for bank holding companies like Horizon. 
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 
 Under FDICIA, federal banking regulatory authorities are required to take regulatory enforcement actions known as prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is categorized as well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators corrective powers include: (i) requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; (ii) placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; (iv) restricting transactions with affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, for critically undercapitalized institutions, appointing a receiver for the institution. 
 New prompt corrective action requirements that became effective January 1, 2015, increased the capital level requirements necessary to qualify as well capitalized. At December 31, 2018, the Bank was categorized as well capitalized, meaning that the Banks total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10%, the Banks Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 8%, the Banks common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio exceeded 6.5%, the Banks leverage ratio exceeded 5%, and the Bank was not subject to a regulatory order, agreement or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. 
 Banking regulators may change these capital requirements from time to time, depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook for the banking industry. For instance, when established, the new Community Bank Leverage Ratio prescribed by the Regulatory Relief Act will set the standard for a well-capitalized institution for purposes of prompt corrective action. The Company is unable to predict whether and when any such further capital requirements would be imposed and, if so, to what levels and on what schedule. 
 Anti-Money Laundering  The USA Patriot Act and the Bank Secrecy Act 
 Horizon is subject to the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires financial institutions to implement additional policies and procedures to address money laundering, suspicious activities and currency transaction reporting, and currency crimes. The regulations promulgated under the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 require financial institutions such as the Bank to adopt controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of their customers. 
 The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, which was amended to incorporate certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, also focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing and requires financial institutions to develop policies, procedures and practices to prevent, detect and deter these activities, including customer identification programs and procedures for filing suspicious activity reports. Banks had until May 2018 at the latest to update their policies with respect to new customer due diligence regulations adopted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the Bank Secrecy Act. During 2018, Horizon Bank implemented the Fifth Pillar of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) which focuses on identifying beneficial ownership. The BSA officer and BSA analysts incorporated these enhanced due diligence requirements into the Banks policies, procedures and training programs in 2018.

Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations relating thereto, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for Horizon and the Bank. 
 Federal Securities Law and NASDAQ 
 The shares of common stock of Horizon have been registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act (the 1934 Act). Horizon is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules of the SEC promulgated thereunder. 
 Shares of common stock held by persons who are affiliates of Horizon may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If Horizon meets the current public information requirements under Rule 144, each affiliate of Horizon who complies with the other conditions of Rule 144 (including those that require the affiliates sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons) would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of Horizon or (ii) the average weekly volume of trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Horizon is required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation payable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These votes are non-binding and advisory. At least once every six years, Horizon must also permit shareholders to determine, on an advisory basis, whether such votes on executive compensation (called say on pay votes) should be held every one, two, or three years. In both 2012 and 2018, Horizons shareholders voted in favor of presenting the executive compensation say on pay question every year. 
 Shares of common stock of Horizon are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol HBNC, and Horizon is subject to the rules of NASDAQ for listed companies. 
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 Horizon is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), which revised the laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies with equity or debt securities registered under the 1934 Act. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act established: (i) new requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) new standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violation of the securities laws. 
 Pursuant to the final rules adopted by the SEC to implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Horizon is required to include in each Form 10-K it files a report of management on Horizons internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include a statement of managements responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting of Horizon, identify the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of Horizons internal control over financial reporting and provide managements assessment of the effectiveness of Horizons internal control over financial reporting. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes an attestation report issued by Horizons registered public accounting firm on Horizons internal control over financial reporting.

Financial System Reform  The Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB and the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act 
 The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that have profoundly affected how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies are regulated. Among other things, these provisions eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferred its functions to the other federal banking agencies, relaxed rules regarding interstate branching, allowed financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts, changed the scope of federal deposit insurance coverage and imposed new capital requirements on bank and thrift holding companies. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain other statutes. In July 2011, many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies were transferred to the CFBP. The CFBP has a large budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority over depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB also has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with offering consumer financial products. Additionally, the CFPB is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. 
 The CFPB has indicated that mortgage lending is an area of supervisory focus and that it will concentrate its examination and rulemaking efforts on the variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages. The CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-repay, mortgage servicing, escrow accounts, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess a borrowers ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so called qualified mortgages. Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class action, and attorneys fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. 
 The CFPB also amended Regulation C to implement amendments to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act made by the Dodd-Frank Act. The amendment added a significant number of new information collecting and reporting requirements for financial institutions, most of which became effective as of January 1, 2018. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types, many of which may have an impact on the operating environment of Horizon in substantial and unpredictable ways. Horizon has incurred higher operating costs in complying with the Dodd-Frank Act, and expects these higher costs to continue for the foreseeable future. 
 In May 2018, the Regulatory Relief Act was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Regulatory Relief Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory relief for community banks such as Horizon Bank. 
 The Regulatory Relief Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single Community Bank Leverage Ratio of between 8% and 10% to replace the leverage and risk-based regulatory capital ratios. The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institutions risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the new ration. In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act includes regulatory relief for community banks regarding regulatory examination cycles, call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.

 HORIZON BANCORP, INC. 
 
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Regulatory Relief Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. 
 Horizons management will continue to review the status of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and the Regulatory Relief Act, and to assess their probable impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations of Horizon. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System 
 The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of twelve regional FHLBs. Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLB is funded primarily from funds deposited by banks and savings associations and proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. All FHLB advances must be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), an independent agency, controls the FHLB System, including the FHLB of Indianapolis. 
 The FHLB imposes various limitations on advances such as limiting the amount of certain types of real estate related collateral to 30% of a members capital and limiting total advances to a member. Interest rates charged for advances vary depending upon maturity, the cost of funds to the FHLB of Indianapolis and the purpose of the borrowing. 
 The FHLBs are required to provide funds for the resolution of troubled savings associations and to contribute to affordable housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low and moderate income housing projects. 
 As a member of the FHLB, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis in an amount equal to at least 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts, or similar obligations at the beginning of each year. At December 31, 2018, the Banks investment in stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis was $18.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018, dividends paid by the FHLB of Indianapolis to the Bank on the FHLB stock totaled approximately $875,000, for an annualized rate paid in dividends of 4.9%. 
 Limitations on Rates Paid for Deposits; Restrictions on Brokered Deposits 
 FDIC regulations restrict the interest rates that less than well-capitalized insured depository institutions may pay on deposits and also restrict the ability of such institutions to accept brokered deposits. These regulations permit a well capitalized depository institution to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits without restriction, and an adequately capitalized depository institution to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits with a waiver from the FDIC (subject to certain restrictions on payments of rates). The regulations prohibit an undercapitalized depository institution from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits. These regulations contemplate that the definitions of well capitalized, adequately capitalized and undercapitalized will be the same as the definitions adopted by the agencies to implement the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA. The Bank is a well-capitalized institution, and management does not believe that these regulations have a materially adverse effect on the Banks current operations. 
Community Reinvestment Act 
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular 
 
16 


 HORIZON BANCORP, INC. 
 
 community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a banks CRA performance will be considered in its expansion proposals (e.g., branching and acquisitions of other financial institutions) and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, the Bank was rated satisfactory with respect to its CRA compliance. 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Financial Privacy 
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act adopted in 1999 (Gramm-Leach) was intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks, insurance companies, the securities industry and other financial service providers. Gramm-Leach was responsible for establishing a distinct type of bank holding company, known as a financial holding company, which is allowed to engage in an expanded range of financial services, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. As previously discussed, Horizon has qualified as, and elected to become, a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach amendments to the BHC Act. 
 Under Gramm-Leach, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to non-affiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 
 As a financial institution, the Bank handles a significant amount of sensitive data, including personal information. The Company does not disclose any non-public information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and subject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information. 
 We are also subject to guidance from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency body for five federal banking regulators, with respect to such matters as data privacy, disaster recovery and cybersecurity. 
 Horizon continues to monitor existing and new privacy and data security laws for their impact on Horizons business operations, including the applicability of laws such as the European Unions comprehensive 2018 General Data Privacy Regulation to Horizon and its customers. 
 Interchange Fees for Debit Cards 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees for bank card transactions must be reasonable and proportional to the issuers incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs. Interchange fees are transaction fees between banks for each bank card transaction, designed to reimburse the card-issuing bank for the costs of handling and credit risk inherent in a bank credit or debit card transaction. Although institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion, like the Bank, are exempt from this requirement, competitive pressures are likely to require smaller depository institutions to reduce fees with respect to these bank card transactions. 
Other Regulation 
 In addition to the matters discussed above, the Bank is subject to additional regulation of its activities, including a variety of consumer protection regulations affecting its lending, deposit and debt collection activities and regulations affecting secondary mortgage market activities. Both federal and state law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations.

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 
 The Banks earnings are affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserves monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have major effects upon the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its open market operations in United States government securities and through its regulation of the discount rate on borrowings of member banks and the reserve requirements against member bank deposits. It is not possible to predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 
Legislative Initiatives 
 Additional legislative and administrative actions affecting the banking industry may be considered by the United States Congress, state legislatures and various regulatory agencies, including those referred to above such as the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act. Horizon cannot predict with certainty whether such legislative or administrative action will be enacted or the extent to which the banking industry in general or Horizon and its affiliates in particular will be affected.

Discussion of Non-Accrual Policy 
 

1. | From time to time, the Bank obtains information which may lead management to believe that the collection of payments may be doubtful on a particular loan. In recognition of such, it is managements policy to convert the loan from an earning asset to a non-accruing loan. Further, it is managements policy to place a commercial loan on a non-accrual status when delinquent in excess of 90 days or it has had the accrual of interest discontinued by management. The officer responsible for the loan, the Chief Credit Officer and the senior commercial loan workout officer must review all loans placed on non-accrual status.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Potential Problem Loans:
---+-------------------------

 Impaired and non-accrual loans for which the discounted cash flows or collateral value exceeded the carrying value of the loan totaled $15.2 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The allowance for impaired and non-accrual loans included in the Banks allowance for loan losses totaled $1.0 million and $184,000 at those respective dates. The average balance of impaired loans during 2018 and 2017 was $7.4 million and $3.8 million. 
 

3. | Foreign Outstandings:
---+----------------------

None. 
 

4. | Loan Concentrations:
---+---------------------

 As of December 31, 2018, there are no significant concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans. See Item III A above for a listing of the types of loans by concentration. 
 

D. | Other Interest-Bearing Assets
---+------------------------------

 There are no other interest-bearing assets as of December 31, 2018, which would be required to be disclosed under Item III C.1 or 2 if such assets were loans.
