ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
General
 
IR-Med, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada in April 2007 under the name “Monster Motors, Inc.” IR-Med, Inc. began operating the business of IR. Med Ltd. An Israeli company, through a reverse acquisition on December 24, 2020. IR. Med Ltd. (an Israeli company which was founded in 2013) continues as an operating subsidiary of IR-Med, Inc.; IR-Med, Inc. is the sole stockholder of IR. Med Ltd.
 
IR-Med, Inc.’s corporate headquarters and IR. Med Ltd.’s research facilities are located at ZHR Industrial Zone, Rosh Pina, Israel.
 
Business Overview
 
IR-Med is a development stage medical device company that is developing non-invasive devices for various medical indications, by detecting and measuring various biomarkers and molecules in the blood and in human tissue in real-time, allowing healthcare professionals to detect and measure different molecules in the blood and in human tissue in real-time without any invasive procedures. Our initial product candidates are currently in various stages of development.
 
Our initial product under development, which we call PressureSafe, is a handheld optical monitoring device that is being developed to support early detection of pressure injuries (PI) to the skin and underlying tissue, regardless of skin tone and which calibrated personally to each patient’s skin, primarily caused by prolonged pressure associated with bed confinement. Our skin-device-interphase development of personalized medical devices allows high accuracy readings from the human body in a non-invasive method, that may provide caregiver the optimal decision support-system in cases where uncertainties disturb physicians in their decision processes. We plan to launch as a decision support system (DSS) tool for care givers in Hospitals, Nursing homes and Home-Care companies,
 
We are also in the preliminary stage of research and development of an innovative otoscope, which we call Nobiotics, to support physicians with an immediate indication as to whether mid-ear infection (Otitis Media), a common malady in children, is of a bacterial origin and thus requiring antibiotic treatment, or of a viral origin and does not require antibiotic treatment.
 
Our technology platform utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is a broad term generally used to describe conditions where a machine mimics “cognitive” functions associated with human intelligence, such as “learning” and “problem solving. Basic AI includes machine learning, where a machine uses algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about a given phenomenon. The machine is “trained” using large amounts of data and algorithms that provide it with the ability to learn how to perform the task.
 
The global diagnostics market is driven in large part by solutions that can be applied in healthcare settings, as these tools will drive decisions regarding specific treatments and the associated outlays. However, despite advances in medical imaging and other diagnostic tools, misdiagnosis remains a common occurrence. We believe that offering additional Decision Support Systems (DSS) tools may improve diagnoses and outcomes through the adoption of AI-based decision support tools.
 
Our initial focus is on the development of DSS solutions utilizing our proprietary platform for the pre-emptive diagnosis of pressure injuries (PI) and of mid-ear infections detection. Our current business plan focuses on two principal medical devices currently in development:
 
1. PressureSafe — a handheld optical monitoring device that is being developed to support early detection of pressure injuries (PI) to the skin and underlying tissue, primarily caused by prolonged pressure associated with bed confinement; and

2. Nobiotics, an innovative otoscope, being designed to support physicians with an immediate indication as to whether mid-ear infection (Otitis Media), a common malady in children, is of a bacterial origin and thus requiring antibiotic treatment, or of a viral origin and does not require antibiotic treatment.
 
Our product candidates are in various stages of development. The PressureSafe device is in an advanced stage of development and is planned to be our first go-to-market product, and the NoBiotics is in initial stage of research and development.
 
We have completed the development of the first generation PressureSafe prototype in the second quarter of 2022 In June 2022, IR Med. Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a study agreement with Beit Rivka, a Large Geriatric Hospital in Israel associated with Clalit, the largest Health Insurance Fund in Israel, to conduct a usability study of Pressuresafe. In August 2022, IR Med. Ltd., entered into an agreement with a Israeli boutique industrial design company specializing in the design of medical devices and diagnostic products servicing a broad array of companies, including large multinational companies, for the design of the PressureSafe device in its advanced configuration, which incorporates preliminary results from a usability study currently being performed in Israel, including feedback from healthcare professionals. In February 2023, our subsidiary IR-Med Ltd. entered into an agreement with Rabin Medical Center (RMC) in Israel to perform a usability study, as an additional study center to the current study that we have been performing at Beit-Rivka, a large geriatrics hospital in Israel. The agreement is to conduct a usability study of our proprietary and patent protected “PressureSafe” device, which we plan to launch as a decision support system (DSS) tool for care givers in Hospitals, Nursing homes and Home-Care companies.
 
We are currently working on completing the development of the commercial version of the PressureSafe device, planned to be launched during 2023, pending FDA clearance.
 
In the third quarter of 2022, we began preparations in anticipation of commercialization of PressureSafe in the United States pending regulatory approvals. A distribution agreement was entered into with PI Prevention Care LLC (the “Distributor”), a newly formed entity focused on marketing to the senior care facility, hospital and homecare markets. The Distributor, which received exclusive rights for PressureSafe distribution across the United States, includes personnel who have many years’ experience in addressing and responding to the needs of these types of organizations. Under the terms of the Agreement which were previously disclosed, to maintain exclusivity the Distributor is obligated to comply with minimum purchase requirements of the device and accompanying disposables.
 
Overview of Target Market and our Solutions
 
Pressure Injury Market
 
Populations are aging due to improvements in healthcare. However, there are increased rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. This combination of increasing ageing population and such diseases has resulted in more people needing assistance with activities of daily living due to decreased mobility. A major morbidity of decreased mobility is development of Pressure Injuries (PI). PI develop as a result of a combination of physiologic events and external conditions. Along with localized ischemia and reperfusion injury to tissues, impaired lymphatic drainage and mechanical deformation of tissue cells have been shown to contribute to injury as well.
 
Compression prevents lymph fluid drainage, and deterioration in tissue cell normal activities, which causes increased interstitial fluid and waste build up and contributes to PI development. The time required to develop a PI is dependent on many factors, including the patient’s physiology and the degree of pressure and shear force place on the tissue. PI occur over predictable pressure points where bony protuberances are more likely to compress tissues when the patient is in prolonged contact with hard surfaces. Studies show that heel area is the second most frequent location for a pressure ulcer, the most prevalent being the sacrum. The heel accounts for between 23% and 28% of all pressure ulcers1.
 
While the number of Hospital Acquired Conditions (HAC) have decreased by 8%2, pressure injuries have resisted improvement efforts and continue to grow by 10% annually. PI are both costly and deadly. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reports that PI add $10.2 billion to annual U.S. Healthcare costs3. Furthermore, these are associated with over 45% of the 63,619 HAC related deaths in the U.S., making it the leading contributor to HAC related deaths.

The most common method used to detect early PI is a visual assessment by a professional caregiver focusing on areas where PI most frequently develop. This visual assessment is subjective, unreliable, untimely (PI often occur suddenly without visual cues) ineffective, and can only detect PI once it is visible. Technology-based methods for detecting and monitoring PI have been developed but as far as we know, none have succeeded in providing an effective solution.
 
PI Background
 
As of today, PI are discovered only as they begin to appear on the skin, after they have been festering underneath the skin layers. Nurses regularly assess patients at high risk by evaluating them according to accepted scores (Braden, Norton scores), and hospitals can then get the patient onto a different type of mattress that wicks away moisture, reduces pressure and have orders for the individual, for example, to be turned every 2 hours. The risk of a PI in ICU ranges between 18-40% of patients4.
 
Intrinsic risk factors such as diabetes, malnutrition, and smoking also increase the overall risk for PI. The spinal cord injury patient population is at the highest risk (25–66%) of developing a PI due to the combination of immobility and decreased sensation. A prospective study of spinal cord patients not only found that sacral and ischial PI were very common (43% and 15%, respectively), as might be expected, but also noted that the second most common location was on the heel (19%)5.
 
Nursing home patients have a PI prevalence of 11%6 and are most likely to develop PI over the sacrum or heels. Nursing home patients were also found to have contractures at a prevalence of 55%. Contractures are caused by decreased elasticity of the tissue surrounding major joints, and the resulting lack of full mobility in the affected extremities significantly increases the risk of PI formation.
 
A significant market is the home healthcare market, which is anticipated to be worth $645 billion by 2025 (CAGR 8.7%)7. It is estimated that by 2030, seniors aged 65 and over will represent 20% of the U.S. population and over 19 million seniors are estimated to need home care services. The homecare companies have a strong incentive to prevent PI as they are rated and carry part of the cost treating those patients.
 
According to a survey published in 2000 by UCLA School of Medicine8, in a total sample of 3,048 patients, 9.12% had PI and of these 37.4% had more than one PI and 14% had three or more. Considering the worst PI for each subject, 40.3% had Stage II and 27% had Stage III or IV injuries.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has identified several basic principles for PI prevention: (a) use a validated tool to assess risk such as the Braden Scale and Norton Scale; (b) implement a preventive plan for residents at risk, which should focus on avoiding friction and shear trauma to skin regions at risk as well as an individualized plan to reduce pressure such as frequent repositioning; (c) daily inspection of the skin for high risk residents as deep tissue damage can occur in as little as two hours, there needs to be a daily skin examination. The most common method used to detect early PI is a visual assessment by a professional caregiver focusing on areas where PI most frequently develop. This visual assessment is subjective, unreliable, untimely, as a PI develops under the skin before it becomes visible to the naked eye, and ineffective. Technology-based methods for detecting and monitoring PI have been developed but none have succeeded in providing an effective solution. These include ulcer detection based on skin conductivity which has relatively low resolution and is influenced by different topical skin conditions (moist, urine, feces). Other system solution methods such as electronic medical record programs, which prompt providers to document results of PI screening every shift or day, are of great importance in diagnosing PI early and preventing progression. A common product are pads which are designed to specifically cover pressure points such as the sacrum and heels as well as foam pads designed to wrap around body parts at risk. However, it is important to note that some pads can actually be detrimental, i.e. supports with cut-outs can have increased pressure at their edges.
 
PressureSafe
 
Over the past six years we have been designing and developing PressureSafe, a novel device that has the potential to provide a reliable method of monitoring and recording patients providing additional information to healthcare providers as where and when a PI may occur. The technology platform is designed to record information relating to each patient. The IR based core technologies underlying the PressureSafe device are patent-protected (US Patent No. US 10,709,365) and (US Patent No. US10,772,541). Our technology is based on the fact that tissues of the human body absorb and reflect the light that surrounds it in different wave lengths (from the UV through visual light to infra-red light) and the light is reflected and scattered back from inside the body through the skin. During this process the reflected and scattered light through a damaged area changes its properties in comparison to light reflection and scattering from normal healthy tissue. The PressureSafe is being designed to capture, analyze and identify tissue status to make early PI diagnosis using Spectrographic Analysis while AI learning software is planned to improve diagnostic accuracy. The PressureSafe device will illuminate the skin with a miniature LEDs for a few seconds. The emitted light photons from the device will be absorbed, scattered and reflected back. The device will then measure the absorption and reflectance, and using algorithms, will process the signals to identify and diagnose the scanned area.
 
As every person’s skin properties are unique, the diagnosing physician must calibrate the device to the specific patient’s skin, a process that takes merely a few seconds and allows personalized diagnosis, improving diagnostic process effectiveness as the PressureSafe device is designed to be indifferent to the skin color. Our technology is being developed to enable the assessment of different subdermal layers by scanning through these skin layers, thus improving the identification of the damage and assessing the subdermal damaged tissue volume, assisting with additional information to allow better treatment efficacy. Measuring the differences of subdermal fluid content and other bio-signals, has been developed to detect early formation of pressure injuries and to “raise a flag” to allow the caregivers intervene and prevent their appearance. The bio-signals that our algorithm detects occur in the early inflammatory process, as soon as local subcutaneous tissue function is disturbed, and cells begin to be damaged.
 
PressureSafe is a hand-held scanner designed to provide additional information as a decision support system (DSS), to support the care giver effectively with the main diagnostic ability to identify PI and to differentiate between Deep Tissue PI (before it becomes visible) and Stage 1 PI. Deep tissue PI are serious, hospital-acquired deep PIs that form under intact skin, spread in deep tissues and eventually present themselves as full thickness wounds. The PressureSafe is composed of: (a) a handheld optic probe device, which utilizes harmless infra-red light, that is placed for a few seconds on suspected areas for performing mearurements; (b) a disposable probe tip component, changed between patients to avoid cross-contamination; (c) a software component containing machine learning algorithm for analyzing the collected data; and (d) software for connectivity and downloading the collected data and measurements results to the EMR/EHR systems used by the medical center or homecare company.

PressureSafe is a non-invasive real-time optical monitoring device to support early intervention in PI treatment prior to skin breakage. The device performs a reflectance spectroscopy scan to generate information for the decision maker, while collecting data of subdermal physiological changes together with other bio-signals typical to early formation of PI in the three skin layers, thus detecting the appearance of life risking pressure injuries. PressureSafe is designed to detect changes at a depth of 1-5 mm in the skin, regardless of skin tone, by measuring differences of subdermal fluid content and bio-signals. As soon as local subcutaneous tissue function is disturbed and cells begin to disintegrate by pressure excreted upon by dependent body areas, our scanner is designed to be able to support detecting this as a very early inflammatory process. The technology will allow patient monitoring and immediate reading in a non-invasive way. It has the potential to help to reduce the number of PI dramatically, through early detection, making it attractive for public and private healthcare systems worldwide.
 
PressureSafe Studies
 
The PressureSafe first generation device is currently undergoing usability studies, and the commercial version is now in development and is planned to be launched during the second half of 2023.
 
We are currently conducting usability studies at two medical centers in Israel, a Geriatric hospital and a general hospital, planned to be completed during 2023. We also plan to start useability studies in the US during 2023 in order to validate the efficacy of the device for the US cohort including patients with dark skin tones.
 
Our POC study began in the first quarter of 2018 at the Rambam Healthcare campus, located in Haifa, Israel and at the Beit Lowenstein Rehabilitation Center, located in Raanana, Israel. A total of 76 samples were taken from both medical centers. The results demonstrated that the PressureSafe had a 94.7% accuracy in identifying Stage 1 pressure injuries and a 5.3% misclassification rate.
 
Ear Infection Market
 
Reducing the consumption of antibiotics is a major goal of the health authorities around the world. Doctors all over the world are rushing to keep up with infections that are getting increasingly good at resisting antibiotic treatment, including gonorrhea, tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia and others.
 
Antibiotics either kill bacteria or keep them from multiplying. By definition, they work only against bacterial illnesses—and yet, research shows they are often needlessly prescribed for viral illnesses like the flu and common colds. That is a waste of resources and may also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Bacteria is developing better resistance to drugs each time they encounter them. The result is the creation of super bugs that are resistant to that antibiotic.
 
In 2019 the World Health Organization described antimicrobial resistance—pathogens’ ability to evade medical interventions—one of the 10 largest threats to global health9.
 
According to the CDC in the US 35,000 people die each year due to antibiotic-resistant infections. A recent study published in the BMJ points to one major propagator of the problem: doctors are incorrectly prescribing antibiotics and up to 43% of U.S. antibiotic prescriptions may be inappropriate.
 
Studies conducted by the University of Utah10 showed that in 2016 30% of outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions may have been inappropriate. For example, 1 in every 5.4 urgent visits, which represents 18.5% of such visits, resulted in an antibiotic prescription. Of these, 37% were for ear infections which turned out to be viral infections.
 
The health community is already seeing the consequences of these improper prescriptions. In addition to the deaths detailed in the CDC’s recent report, an estimated 2.8 million Americans contract and survive antibiotic- resistant infections each year. As illnesses get more and more difficult to treat, patients may suffer longer, and doctors might be forced to turn to increasingly powerful drugs, often with harmful side effects.
 
The antibiotic taken by children kills bacteria in their body, even the good bacteria, changing gut microbiome with toddlers, possibly leading to other problems, like clostridium difficile (C. difficile infection).

Nearly 70,000 children end up in emergency rooms every year after experiencing adverse reactions to antibiotic drugs, according to the CDC11. Most of these incidents were due to an allergy, and most were mild reactions (such as a rash), although some were more serious (such as anaphylaxis). Children under the age of 2 made up the largest share of the ER visits.
 
There are several long-term problems associated with children’s consumption of antibiotics. For example, studies have found that children receiving more rounds of the drugs because of early infections are more likely to be obese as adolescents and adults and the earlier children are exposed to the drugs, the more likely their metabolism is to be affected12.
 
Each year in the US, approximately 9 million children, ages 0-17, are reported to have ear infections or otitis media13. Of those, 8 million children visited a physician or obtained a prescription drug to treat the condition.
 
However, the number of children complaining of ear pain and undergoing examination by otoscope is many times these figures and they represent IR-MED’s target market.
 
Medical spending to treat otitis media totals over $2.8 billion, with the average annual expenditure of more than $350 per person. More than one-third of ear infection prescription medications expenditures were paid from out of pocket.
 
The Global Ear Infection Treatment Market is expected to reach $22.3 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of about 6.6% in the period 2017-202314.
 
The market is being driven by the rise in risk factors, increasing awareness regarding the severity of untreated ear infection, development of healthcare, technological development in diagnostic devices and surgery segment especially the advancements in minimally invasive surgery and so on. Market restraints are the complications of surgery, high cost of treatment and the emergence of bacterial resistance.
 
Ear Infection Background
 
An ear infection is an inflammation of the middle ear, usually caused by bacteria or a virus, which occurs together with fluid builds up behind the eardrum. Three out of four children will have at least one ear infection by their third birthday15. In fact, ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor.
 
The presence of middle ear fluid is the key diagnostic marker for the two most common pediatric ear diseases, acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME)16.
 
AOM, known commonly as an “ear infection” is characterized by the presence of infected fluid in the middle ear and results in symptoms of fever and ear pain.
 
It is a leading cause of pediatric healthcare visits, and although many cases can resolve without antibiotics, complications may include eardrum perforation, mastoiditis, facial nerve palsy, or meningitis.

OME is the presence of middle ear fluid without signs of an acute infection and affects up to 80% of children. Although OME has few overt symptoms, making diagnosis more difficult, it is associated with speech delay, sleep disruption, poor school performance, balance issues, and a higher likelihood of developing AOM.
 
The simplest way for a doctor to diagnose an ear infection is by using an otoscope, a lighted instrument, to view and assess the eardrum. A red, bulging eardrum indicates an infection.
 
Other methods a doctor can use include: (i) Pneumatic otoscope, which blows a puff of air into the ear canal, this allows the doctor to observe the eardrum movement. A normal eardrum will move back and forth more easily than an eardrum with fluid behind it; and (ii) Tympanometry, this is soft plug that contains a miniature microphone and speaker as well as a device that varies air pressure in the ear, measuring how flexible the eardrum is at different pressures.
 
Many doctors will prescribe an antibiotic, such as amoxicillin, to be taken over seven to 10 days. The doctor also may recommend over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, also as eardrops, to help with fever and pain.
 
If the doctor is not able to make a definite diagnosis of OME and the child does not have severe ear pain or a fever, the doctor may suggest waiting a day or so to see if the earache goes away. Today, when a child has ear pain, the doctor will check the ear but unless there is a clear visible need, he/she will probably not give any treatment beside pain relief - due to simple fact that he/she cannot determine if the infection is Viral – which no antibiotic should be given or Bacterial which will require antibiotic treatment.
 
The American Academy of Pediatrics17 issued guidelines in 2013 that encourage doctors to observe and closely follow these children with ear infections that cannot be definitively diagnosed, especially those between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. If there is no improvement within 48 to 72 hours from when symptoms began, the guidelines recommend doctors start antibiotic therapy. Reducing the consumption of antibiotics is a major goal of the health authorities around the world.
 
Nobiotics
 
The Nobiotics device is planned to be an otoscope for supporting noninvasive detection of otitis media (ear infection). The device is in initial stages of development as an ear examination device that will give the physician an immediate indication if the infection is from a Viral or Bacterial source and then the physician will make a decision if to prescribe an antibiotic or not (DSS). The device works on a similar IR-spectrographic analysis method as being developed in the PressureSafe device. The Nobiotics otoscope is based on infrared light reflection and absorption by the effluents behind the ear drum. Otoscopes are considered a required device by any physicians performing physical diagnoses. Target customers for the Nobiotics device are general practitioners (GPs), pediatricians and ear nose and throat (ENT) specialists.
Our Strategy
 
Our goal over the next five years is to establish our technology and related products as the gold standard for the targeted sectors. The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 
Develop and expand a balanced and diverse pipeline of products and product candidates. Our core platform technologies will include innovative spectrographic analysis tools for diagnostic aid, AI, devices and product candidates in various development and clinical stages. We plan to add products and product candidates to our pipeline by expanding our technologies being developed to additional indications and through investing in new technologies, products and product candidates. By maintaining this multi-product approach, we aim to provide a broad and comprehensive product offering, which we believe will result in multiple value inflection events, reduced risks to our potentially business associated with a particular product or product candidate and increased return on investment. Furthermore, product candidates that we develop may create attractive collaboration opportunities with pharma, diagnostics, medical devices and medical supplies companies.

Target large and growing patient populations with significant unmet medical needs. PIs and ear infections are medical conditions afflicting large and growing global patient populations, each with significant unmet medical needs such as requiring earlier and more accurate diagnosis, reducing the widespread reliance on antibiotics, optimizing the delivery of medical services, thereby improving the efficacy and safety of treatment.
 
Maintain a global, diverse network of specialists to accelerate knowledge synergies and innovation. We are planning to utilize a global network of specialists to identify large and growing patient populations with significant unmet medical needs, evaluate and prioritize potential technologies, assist in designing development plans and diagnostic protocols and determine potential indications of our platform technologies to our target patient populations in various territories. We believe that maintaining this diverse network of specialists and industry specialists will allow us to continue to maximize knowledge and cost synergies, utilize shared commercial infrastructure across products, reduce risks of development and commercialization delays to our overall business and leverage our current and future platform technologies and technologies for additional products and product candidates.
 
Establish distribution channels to maximize the commercial potential of our products. We plan to seek out collaborative arrangements with major healthcare providers to facilitate market adoption of our product candidates. In this respect, we have entered into a distribution agreement covering the United States. See below “Distribution Agreement”. We believe that such institutions are well positioned to directly benefit from improvements in accurate diagnosis and reduction of cost of care associated with the use of our product candidates. We also believe that the marginal cost of our product candidates compared to potential savings will make it economical for healthcare institutions to adopt our products regardless of whether or not additional costs of purchase of these products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs and commercial insurance companies. Through cooperation with healthcare providers, we aim to develop and prove an economic model beneficial to them. Thereafter, we plan to engage with private insurance plans to develop reimbursement programs encouraging the use of our product candidates. We expect that adoption rates of our product candidates will increase if hospitals and other medical institutions are compensated, in full or in part, for additional costs incurred when purchasing our products.
 
Disposable unit/Pay Per Use (PPU) business model - Our developing business model will be based on disposable need to be changed per each patient been examined. This will allow potential customers to pay only per use of the device, with minimal investing in equipment and have great potential to generate substantial revenues to the company. Especially following the days of a world pandemic of COVID-19, where cross contamination of any kind is forbidden.
 
R&D and New Product Development
 
We believe our strong research and development capabilities are one of our principal competitive strengths. Our R&D activities are conducted at our subsidiary’s facility in Israel. Our team of employees and sub-contractors is comprised of current and future dedicated research and development employees, system architects, algorithm developers engineers, software engineers, electronics and electro-optics engineers, quality engineers and regulatory and health experts, who are responsible for the research design, development and testing of our technologies and product candidates.
 
We plan to increase our R&D team as necessary to meet our product development goals and milestones, and deliver the products in the right time to market, and in the required quality.

If for whatever reason the Distributor does not comply with the minimum purchase requirements in any year, the Distributor can continue to have a non-exclusive license and distribution rights in the United States if the Distributor pays the annual license fee.
 
Subject to the compliance by the Distributor of its obligation under the Distribution Agreement, including the purchase by the Distributor of minimum annual purchase requirements of the components of the Products, the Distribution Agreement continues in effect for a term of thirteen years following the Commercial Launch Date. At the end of the initial three and eight year period, the parties are to enter into good faith negotiations as to the pricing of the Products and the minimum purchase quantities for the subsequent period. The Distributor also agreed to not distribute any products that compete with the Products.
 
Intellectual Property
 
General
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, and other intellectual property to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important inventions and know-how, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of diagnostic decision- support software devices.

The IR based core technologies underlying the PressureSafe device are covered by patent issued (US Patent No. US 10,709,365) and (US Patent No. US10,772,541) issued on July 14, 2020 and September 15, 2020 respectively. All our patents are marked under “system and method for noninvasive analysis of subcutaneous tissue”. Such patents are owned by IR-Med Ltd. and are valid through August 2034.
 
These patents are based on physical phenomena of light reflection from the surface of the skin. The PressureSafe device irradiates the surface of tissue with harmless infrared and visual light radiation. The reflected light from the tissue changes its physical properties according to the level of injury in the sub dermal tissue (under the skin). Comparing the reflected light from a healthy tissue and reflected light from a suspected injured tissue allows early detection of sub dermal pressure injuries.
 
During 2022 IR-Med applied for two new provisional patents in the US. and European Union, one for the PressureSafe device and one for NoBiotics.
 
As of the date of this report, a significant portion of our granted U.S. patent applications and pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions is directed to enhance both the PressureSafe and other future applications devices. However, some of these patent applications may not result in issued patents, and not all issued patents may be maintained in force for their entire term.
 
Competition
 
We operate in highly competitive segments of the medical device markets. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial medical device enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than us. Large medical device companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for medical devices. We also may compete with these organizations to recruit scientists and clinical development personnel. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
We expect PressureSafe, if and when commercially available, to compete directly with Bruin’s Biometrics Provizio SEM Scanner, which is currently commercially available in the US, UK and the EU. As we intend with the PressureSafe device, the Bruin scanner is marketed to senior care facilities, as well as other health care centers. Bruin’s product is based on electro - resistance measurement of the skin moisture, a method that it significantly different that the approach contained in the PressureSafe device which utilizes real-time optical monitoring device combined with an AI based capabilities for pre-emptive detection of pressure injuries in different settings. In addition, new developments, including the development of other medical device technologies and methods of preventing pressure injuries, occur in the medical device industry at a rapid pace.
 
We expect Nobiotics, if completed, to compete with other otoscopes which are in development or other products in development for the purpose of assisting with assessment of Otitis Media, for distinguishing between virus and bacteria origin.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. While we plan to depend on third party contract manufacturers for device manufacturing, we plan to perform the final assembly, quality control and release of finished goods in our facilities.
 
Manufacturers of our products are required among other things, to comply with applicable FDA/EMA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA/EMA’s Quality System Regulation (QSR). The QSR requires manufacturing quality assurance and quality control as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.

Major changes to the device generally require regulatory approval before being implemented e.g. adding new indications and additional labeling claims etc.
 
Under FDA Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. Discovery of problems with a product after product release may result in restriction on a product, manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market.
 
We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our product candidates if they are approved. We intend to enter into agreements with a CMO and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval.
 
Distribution and Revenue Generation
 
We intend to establish sales and marketing structures and strategic partnerships in the United States, UK and in Europe to support all of our product candidates.
 
The target market for our PressureSafe device are relevant Health care setting (i.e., hospitals, senior care facilities, home care companies etc.).nursing homes and a growing segment of long terms home care givers. Towards that end, in third quarter of 2022, we began preparations in anticipation of commercialization of PressureSafe in the United States during 2023, pending regulatory approvals. A distribution agreement was entered into with PI Prevention Care LLC, a newly formed entity focused on marketing to the senior care facility, hospital and homecare markets. The Distributor, which received exclusive rights for PressureSafe distribution across the United States, includes personnel who have many years’ experience in addressing and responding to the needs of these types of organizations. Under the terms of the Agreement which were publicly disclosed, to maintain exclusivity the Distributor is obligated to comply with minimum purchase requirements of the device and accompanying disposables.
 
Once we receive the appropriate sales approvals, we expect the marketing will be done with local partners who have the relevant abilities and connections per each territory the company will ask to sell the products at. Since each country has its own specific healthcare system, a local partner (one or more) will be chosen to address the specific market needs- in terms of regulation, technical support and so on. Pricing will be determine by the local partner, taking in account all overhead expected costs, regulation requirements and reimbursement methods.
 
Nobiotics’ target users will be pediatricians, family doctors pediatricians and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctors. The distribution of the Nobiotics is expected to be carried out by companies who are suppling devices and disposables to the target audience.
 
In both the PressureSafe and the Nobiotics devices, the revenue stream is expected to be generated mainly from the disposables and PSaaS (PressureSafe solution as a service) that are needed for the proper operation of the device, while the device itself likely be given under lease agreements. It is envisioned that the disposable component will be mass produced.
 
It is expected that market penetration will be achieved through OEM agreements with one of several large medical device companies, already selling to the target market. At the current time, we have no commitments from any such distributors or OEM partners.
 
Facilities
 
Our subsidiary occupies approximately 130 square meters of facilities located in Rosh Pinna industrial zone, Israel, under an agreement for shared office space and services that expires upon 90 days’ notice by either our subsidiary or the landlord. Through December 31, 2022, we were paying a monthly rent of 15,000 NIS per month (approximately $4,273).

Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing.
Government Regulations.
 
Before we can market our product candidates to the public in the US, we believe they will need to obtain clearance for commercial sales. Our devices will be subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA in the US and other federal, state, and local regulatory bodies.
 
FDA regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, manufacturing, labeling, pre-clinical and clinical trials, post-market adverse event reporting, post-market surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products, product storage, record keeping, pre-market clearance, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution.
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device, such as our PressureSafe and Nobiotics that is intended to be commercially distributed in the United States requires 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Based on the FDA guidance documents that we have reviewed, we expect to be subject to the shorter and more streamlined 510(k) process for PressureSafe, which typically involves less risk of uncertainty, and the submission of less supporting documentation, and without the costly clinical trials; though of course no prior guarantee can be provided as to such regulatory treatment. Generally, gaining 510(k) clearance for a product depends on demonstrating that the subject product is “substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared 510(k) device.
 
For the PressureSafe device, we are working closely with our FDA regulatory consultants to complete our pre-market notification to the FDA for 510(k) clearance and all other necessary design and manufacturing processes. We intend to pursue approximately the same regulatory track for the Nobiotics device.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions: untitled letters or warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusal of or delay in granting 510(k) clearance of new products or modified products or rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances. Any of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. See “Risk Factor – Government Regulation,” above.
 
The FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance of our proposed devices for many reasons, including:
 

● | our inability to demonstrate that our product is safe and effective for its intended users; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | our inability to demonstrate that our product is the “substantial equivalent” of a previously cleared device; 
● | the data from clinical studies that we undertake may be insufficient to support clearance; and 
● | failure of the manufacturing process or facilities we use to meet applicable requirements. 

 
In addition, the FDA may change its pre-market policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay clearance of our devices.
 
Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain regulatory compliance prior to marketing our devices could prevent us from generating revenue therefrom or achieving profitability.
 
Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some customers from using our proposed product and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our proposed devices. If the FDA requires us to go through a more rigorous examination for our proposed product than we currently expect, such as requiring additional testing further verification or other procedures, we may require substantial additional funding sooner than anticipated and/or our product could be severely delayed. Being subject to an extended period of scrutiny or being required to conduct expensive clinical trials would be particularly harmful to our business because our proposed devices currently constate our only products.

Ongoing Regulation by FDA.
 
Placing the PressureSafe device on the market requires in addition:
 

● | Establishment registration and device listing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
● | Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to advertising and promotional activities; 
● | Medical device reporting (MDR) regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
● | Corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
● | Labelling and Unique Device Identification (UDI) regulations; and 
● | Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. (Refer to the section below) 

 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Although premarket clinical trials provide important information on a device’s safety and effectiveness, it is possible that new safety concerns will emerge once the device is on the market. As a result, the FDA continues to monitor device performance after a device has been approved. FDA officials conduct routine inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities across the United States. Manufactures may be informed of inspections in advance, or the inspections may be unannounced. Inspection may be routine or cause by a particular problem. The purpose of these inspections is to make sure developers are following good manufacturing practices. Furthermore, the FDA can shut down a manufacturing facility if required standards are not met.
 
Useability Studies
 
In June 2022, IR Med. Ltd., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a study agreement with Beit Rivka, a Large Geriatric Hospital in Israel associated with Clalit, the largest Health Insurance Fund in Israel, to conduct a usability study of Pressuresafe. In February 2023, our subsidiary IR-Med Ltd. entered into an agreement with Rabin Medical Center (RMC) -a leading general hospital in Israel to perform a usability study, as an additional study center to the current study that we have been performing at Beit-Rivka, a large geriatrics hospital in Israel. The agreement is to conduct a usability study of our proprietary and patent protected “PressureSafe” device, which we plan to launch as a decision support system (DSS) tool for care givers in Hospitals, Nursing homes and Home-Care companies.
 
In addition, we plan to conduct useability studies in the U.S. or other countries on the PressureSafe and on NoBiotics. Additional regulations govern the approval, initiation, conduct, documentation and reporting of clinical studies to regulatory agencies in the countries or regions in which they are conducted. Such investigational use is generally also regulated by local and institutional requirements and policies which usually include review by an ethics committee or institutional review board, or IRB. Failure to comply with all regulations governing such studies could subject the company to significant enforcement actions and sanctions, including halting of the study, seizure of investigational devices or data, sanctions against investigators, civil or criminal penalties, and other actions. Without the data from one or more clinical studies, it may not be possible for us to secure the data necessary to support certain regulatory submissions, to secure reimbursement or demonstrate other requirements. We cannot assure that access to clinical investigators, sites and subjects, documentation and data will be available on the terms and timeframes necessary.

Reimbursement
 
Our current go-to-market strategy does not contemplate or rely upon governmental or third-party payor reimbursement. However, in the future we plan to seek reimbursement for product candidates as a means to expand the adoption of products and broaden our customer base.
 
To the extent that we adopt a market strategy which is in whole or in part reliant on third party reimbursement, commercial sales of our future products will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from such third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Each third-party payor may have its own policy regarding what products it will cover, the conditions under which it will cover such products, and how much it will pay for such products. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved devices. Further, healthcare policy and payment reform models and medical cost containment models are being considered and/or adopted in the United States and other countries. Legislative and/or administrative reforms to applicable reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement for the services in which our products are used or result in the denial of coverage for such services outright. As a result, third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products.
 
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
 
Anti-Kickback Statutes in the United States
 
The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of a good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a U.S. federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that, if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under U.S. federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. federal healthcare programs. The reach of the federal anti-kickback statute was broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The ACA further provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act or the Civil Monetary Penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
The U.S. federal anti-kickback statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, or OIG, has issued a series of regulations, known as the “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG or the U.S. Department of Justice.

Many states have adopted laws similar to the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute. Some of these state prohibitions are broader than the U.S. federal statute, and apply to the referral of patients and recommendations for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Government officials have focused certain enforcement efforts on marketing of healthcare items and services, among other activities, and have brought cases against individuals or entities with sales personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing physician users in an attempt to procure their business.
 
U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
 
HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information and which can impose civil or criminal liability for violations of its provisions.
 
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
International Regulation
 
The European Commission is the legislative body responsible for the EU MDR (Medical Device Regulation) with which manufacturers selling medical products in the European Union and the European Economic Area, or EEA, must comply. The European Union has adopted regulations of the design, manufacture, labeling, clinical studies, post-market clinical follow-up, post-market surveillance and vigilance for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant EU MDR will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable regulations and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the European Union and EEA, after being certified by a Notified Body. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states.
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for bringing the product to the US market.
 
Employees & Consultants
 
As of March 2023, we had seven employees and one service provider, on a full-time basis, with an additional one employee and four service providers, on a part time basis, engaged in product research and development at IR-Med Ltd.

Israeli labor laws govern the length of the workday, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination of employment, equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws and other conditions of employment. Subject to specified exceptions, Israeli law generally requires severance pay upon the retirement, death or dismissal of an employee, and requires us and our employees to make payments to the National Insurance Institute, which is similar to the U.S. Social Security Administration. Our employees have defined benefit pension plans that comply with the applicable Israeli legal requirements. Our employees are not represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. To date, we have not experienced any work stoppages.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings. We may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to a medical device business. These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment and other general claims. We accrue for contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.
