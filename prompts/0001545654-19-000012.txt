ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business and Strategy
Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (“A&B” or the “Company”) is a fully integrated real estate investment trust ("REIT") whose history in Hawai`i dates back to 1870. Over time, we have evolved from a 571-acre sugar plantation on Maui to become one of Hawai`i's premier real estate companies and the owner of the largest anchored neighborhood shopping center portfolio in the state. After a long period as a holding company of operationally and geographically disperse business interests and assets, the Company has established a strategic intent to become a Hawai`i-focused commercial real estate company. This strategy is intended to leverage the Company's extensive local market knowledge and real estate expertise to create value for both shareholders and the community. The Company has made significant progress in implementing that strategy, including the complete migration of its commercial real estate portfolio to Hawai`i ("Migration Strategy") such that the share of cash net operating income ("NOI") generated by Hawai`i commercial assets has grown from about 43% in 2012 to 98% in 2018 and will be 100% in 2019.
The Company owns 18 retail centers in Hawai`i, nine industrial assets, four office properties for a total portfolio gross leasable area ("GLA") of 3.5 million square feet at the end of 2018. A&B also owns a portfolio of ground leases comprising 108.7 acres in Hawai`i and over 45,000 acres of land in Hawai`i, primarily conservation- and agriculture-zoned, but also urban-zoned land suitable for future development. 
A&B's real estate legacy began in 1949 as a developer, master planning the community of Kahului, Maui and providing homes for sale to the Company's plantation employees. While our historic development activity has included both for-sale and for-hold projects, today, we are emphasizing development of income-producing commercial real estate in Hawai`i. Where the Company owns lands for which the highest and best use is residential development or other for-sale product, we seek to monetize these land assets earlier in the development cycle.
In addition, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Grace Pacific LLC ("Grace" or "GP"), the Company operates a materials and construction company in Hawai`i and, through McBryde Resources, LLC, owns and operates several renewable energy assets.
Our Company has a long history, deep relationships and a strong reputation in Hawai`i. In order to maximize value to shareholders and our communities, we are committed to working as "Partners for Hawai`i" and emphasizing investments and activities that enhance the quality of life in the Hawai`i community. Through this commitment and the underpinning of our vision, mission and values, which emphasize integrity and community, we have excelled throughout our 149-year history and have the opportunity to create value for our shareholders in the future. 
The Company operates three segments: Commercial Real Estate; Land Operations; and Materials & Construction. A description of each of the Company's reporting segments follows:

• | Commercial Real Estate ("CRE"): includes leasing, property management, redevelopment and development-for-hold activities. Significant assets include improved commercial real estate and urban ground leases. Income from this segment is principally generated by leasing and operating real estate assets.


• | Land Operations: involves the management and optimization of A&B's land and related assets primarily through the following activities: planning, zoning, financing, constructing, selling, and investing in real property; leasing agricultural land; and renewable energy. Primary assets include landholdings, renewable energy assets (investments in hydroelectric and solar facilities and power purchase agreements) and development-for-sale projects and investments. Financial results from this segment are principally derived from renewable energy operations, income/loss from real estate joint ventures, real estate development sales and fees, and land parcel sales. 


• | Materials & Construction ("M&C"): performs asphalt paving as prime contractor and subcontractor; imports and sells liquid asphalt; mines, processes and sells basalt aggregate; produces and sells asphaltic concrete; provides and sells various construction- and traffic-control-related products; and manufactures and sells precast concrete products. Assets

include two grade A (prime) rock quarries, an asphalt storage terminal, hot mix asphalt plants and quarry and paving equipment. Income is generated principally by materials supply and paving construction.
Proportionately, the CRE segment represents 68.8% of the Company's business, Land Operations represents 15.7% and Materials & Construction represents 13.4% (determined based upon segment assets as a percentage of total assets at December 31, 2018). Additional information about our business segments is provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
The Company's strategy is principally focused on:

• | Growing recurring income streams by leveraging several sources of CRE portfolio growth, including effective leasing and property management, investments in repositioning and redevelopment of existing assets, ground-up development of new assets, purchase of new assets using tax-deferred exchange funds from land sales, and purchase of new assets using the Company's balance sheet;


• | Monetization of development-for-sale pipeline and related investments;


• | Employing landholdings at their highest and best use or monetizing them when realizable values exceed the NPV of alternative uses;


• | Leveraging the Materials & Construction's segment's strong market position and vertical integration to increase earnings and cash flow; and


• | Continuing to practice disciplined and prudent financial management and capital allocation to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility.

Key strategic activities and initiatives by segment are discussed below.
Commercial Real Estate Strategy
Our commercial real estate strategy focuses on Hawai`i, where we benefit from the Company’s deep relationships in the islands, as well as a market positioned for stability and growth, given the state’s robust economic performance and lack of commercially-entitled lands. With a median household income nearly 28.9% above the U.S. national average, the lowest unemployment rate in the nation at 2.4%, solid personal income growth exceeding 2.0% per annum, and a comparatively low square footage of strip retail GLA per capita on Oahu, the Hawai`i retail market compares favorably with other top-tier retail markets in the U.S. Similarly, given the severe shortage of industrial land supply in Hawai`i, industrial market rents and per square foot values exceed those achieved in other U.S. markets, making Hawai`i a high-performing industrial market despite its geographic isolation. In addition to strong resident demographics and market fundamentals, the Hawai`i commercial real estate market is supported by a growing and resilient tourism industry as well as consistently high levels of government spending due to Hawai`i’s strategic defense location between the U.S. and Asia. Therefore, as a result of the Company's Migration Strategy, not only have our assets been concentrated where management is best able to enhance portfolio performance, but the overall asset quality of our portfolio has significantly improved.
To further enhance asset quality and increase the recurring income stream from our commercial portfolio, the Company intends to:

• | Grow income and optimize returns on A&B’s commercial portfolio by:


◦ | Being the landlord of choice by providing desirable locations, quality properties, landlord services and community amenities;


◦ | Leveraging internal property management to efficiently manage operations and maximize cash returns;


◦ | Executing effective marketing and leasing strategies that attract quality tenants in the marketplace and new tenants to Hawai`i by leveraging our position as the largest owner of grocery/drug anchored shopping centers in Hawai`i;


◦ | Investing in the repositioning and redevelopment of existing assets at an appropriate risk-adjusted return on capital;


◦ | Developing new commercial properties at an appropriate risk adjusted return on capital; and


◦ | Selectively acquiring commercial real estate assets in Hawai`i markets at returns that exceed the Company’s risk-adjusted cost of capital.


• | Evaluate other commercial property investment opportunities, such as leased fee assets or other commercial real estate types, when the acquisitions are strategically consistent with the value creation objectives of the Company.

Land Operations Strategy
2

A&B strives to maximize value in its landholdings by employing land at its highest and best use to the benefit of shareholders, employees, its communities and other key stakeholder groups. Certain lands owned by the Company are designated for current or future urban uses and are in various stages of entitlement. For those lands, we intend to continue the entitlement processes and pursue either development of commercial real estate assets for our own portfolio, or monetization over time through sales of land or developed properties. In pursuit of these objectives, the Company intends to:

• | Actively market and sell available development inventory;


• | Entitle certain Hawai`i lands to respond to market demand while meeting community needs;


• | Monetize development-for-sale assets when appropriate to manage risk and return and shift capital to CRE uses;


• | Utilize joint venture structures and third-party capital when pursuit of development-for-sale projects is warranted; and


• | Maintain a disciplined approach to risk management that includes careful assessment of market conditions/risks, prudent structuring of transactions, and maintaining fiscal discipline.

The Company also owns land that is not designated for development including agricultural lands, conservation/watershed lands, quarry sites and land underlying or supporting renewable energy assets. To employ these landholdings at their highest and best use, the Company intends to:

• | Generates revenue by leasing or selling land to diversified agricultural producers;


• | Maintain access to irrigation water to support current and future diversified agriculture activities; and


• | Ensure the effective management and stewardship of watershed and supporting lands.

Materials & Construction Strategy
The Materials & Construction segment of A&B is principally comprised of its subsidiary Grace Pacific. GP is a diversified and vertically integrated construction materials and hot mix asphalt paving contractor based in Kapolei, Hawai`i with operations throughout the Hawaiian Islands. The majority of GP’s paving operations serves public sector clients at the Federal, State and County/Municipal levels. GP owns seven hot-mix asphalt plants throughout the state that support its internal paving operations and third-party customers. GP also owns and operates a rock quarry and processing plant in Makakilo, Hawai`i that is strategically located on the west side of Oahu. Due to the high cost of transporting aggregate and the limited shelf life of asphaltic concrete once it is produced, GP’s Makakilo quarry and hot mix plant are ideally located to service Oahu’s growth areas. 
GP’s vertically integrated production model includes partial ownership of an import terminal for liquid asphalt. These additional resources ensure GP’s access to raw materials and enable it to compete cost effectively. In addition, GP offers a variety of related for-sale and for-rent services including temporary and permanent roadway traffic control (GP Roadway Solutions), Microguard HVAC and tile coatings (GP Maintenance Solutions), custom signage (Peterson Sign Company), unistrut (Unistrut Hawai`i), and structural precast/prestressed concrete (GPRM Prestress). GP is a 50% owner of Maui Paving, LLC ("Maui Paving") which operates primarily on the island of Maui.
GP has undergone a review of operations over the past year, and certain improvements were identified that are expected to be implemented in 2019. In addition, as part of its broader intent to become a focused Hawai`i commercial real estate company, A&B is evaluating strategic options for the eventual monetization of some or all of the GP businesses. No timeline has been established for pursuit of these options.
Financial Strategy
The Company values a strong balance sheet with levels of debt and repayment schedules that would enable it to protect its ownership of assets through market cycles and to provide capital for opportunities to invest at attractive risk-adjusted returns.
To maintain this desired balance sheet posture, the Company intends to:

• | Maintain a disciplined capital allocation strategy with a focus on investments that have attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to the Company’s cost of capital.


• | Continue to enhance leverage metrics through earnings growth and debt reduction;


• | Ensure well-laddered debt maturities and minimize near-term maturing debt;


• | Maintain a high proportion of fixed-rate debt and a longer weighted-average maturity; and


• | Maintain a large unencumbered portfolio of assets
