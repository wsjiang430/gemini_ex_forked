Item 1.  Business
     We are the largest metals service center company in North America (U.S. and Canada) and have been serving our customers for the past 80 years. Our network of metals service centers operates more than 300 locations in 40 states in the U.S. and in 13 other countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, France, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom). Through this network, we provide metals processing services, or first-stage processing, and distribute a full line of more than 100,000 metal products, including alloy, aluminum, brass, copper, carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium and specialty steel products, to more than 125,000 customers in a broad range of industries. We focus on small orders with quick turnaround and increasing levels of value-added processing. In 2018, our average order size was $2,130, approximately 49% of our orders included value-added processing and approximately 40% of our orders were delivered within 24 hours from receipt of the order. Many of our metals service centers process and distribute only specialty metals. We have grown our international presence selectively to support the globalization of our customers. We generated net sales of $11.53 billion in 2018 and net income attributable to Reliance of $633.7 million. 
     Our primary business strategy is to provide the highest levels of quality and service to our customers in the most efficient operational manner, allowing us to maximize our financial results. Our growth strategy is based on increasing our operating results through organic growth activities and strategic acquisitions that enhance our product, customer and geographic diversification with a focus on higher margin specialty products and value-added processing services. We focus on improving the operating performance at acquired locations by integrating them into our operational model and providing them access to capital and other resources to promote growth and efficiencies. We believe our focused growth strategy of diversifying our products, customers and geographic locations makes us less vulnerable to regional or industry specific economic volatility and somewhat lessens the negative impact of volatility experienced in commodity pricing and cyclicality of our customer end markets, as well as general economic trends. We also believe that our focus on servicing customers with small order sizes and quick turnaround, along with our growth and diversification strategy have been instrumental in our ability to produce industry‑leading operating results among publicly traded metals service center companies in North America. 
     We have one operating segment and one reportable segment — metals service centers. Further information about our reportable segment, including geographic information, appears in Note 17 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
     Industry Overview
     Metals service centers acquire carbon steel, aluminum, stainless and alloy steel and other metal products from primary metals producers and then process these materials to meet customer specifications using techniques such as beam, bar, pipe and tube cutting; bending, forming and shaping; coil and flat roll processing; plate and sheet cutting; machining and various other specialized services such as laser cutting, fabricating, and mechanical polishing, among others. Customers purchase from service centers for a variety of reasons, including the ability to obtain value‑added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size, and quality control. Many customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum order sizes specified by mills or because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular periods. Metals service centers respond to a niche market created because of the focus on just-in-time inventory management and materials management outsourcing in the capital goods and related industries. In general, metals service center customers have placed increased emphasis on carrying lower amounts of inventory, especially during declining price environments. We believe that many customers have also reduced their in-house processing capabilities, opting to source processed metal from service centers like us, which has been supportive of our recent capital expenditures and increase in our sustainable annual gross profit margin range. There have been significant advancements in processing equipment in our industry in recent years that have enabled us to provide higher quality products and increase the efficiency of our customers’ manufacturing operations, which has contributed to our ability to increase our selling prices and our gross profit margins. 
     These processing services save our customers time, labor, and expense, reducing their overall manufacturing costs. Specialized metals processing equipment requires high‑volume production to be cost effective. Many manufacturers and their suppliers are not able or willing to invest in the necessary technology, equipment, and warehousing of inventory to 

 
  1

 
efficiently and effectively perform metal processing for their own operations. Accordingly, we believe industry dynamics have created a niche in the market for metals service centers. Metals service centers purchase, process, and deliver metals to end‑users in a more efficient and cost‑effective manner than the end‑user could achieve by dealing directly with the primary producer. Service centers comprise the largest customer group for North American mills, buying and reselling almost 50% of all the carbon, alloy, stainless and specialty steels, aluminum, copper, brass, bronze and superalloys produced in the United States according to an October 2018 report issued by IBISWorld Inc., a global intelligence publication.
     We believe that metals service centers are generally less susceptible to market cycles than metals producers because service centers are generally able to pass on all or a portion of increases in metal costs to their customers, unless they are selling to their customers on a fixed‑price contractual basis. We believe that service center companies, like Reliance, that emphasize rapid inventory turnover and minimal contract sales, are generally less vulnerable to changing metals prices than the metals producers. However, fluctuations in metals pricing have a significant impact on our revenue and profit.
     The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive within localized areas or regions. Many of our competitors operate single, stand‑alone service centers. According to IBISWorld Inc., there are approximately 10,000 metal wholesaling locations operated by more than 7,300 companies in the United States in 2018. The significant number of metals service centers that exist in this fragmented market, along with the consolidation trend continues to create opportunities for us to expand by making acquisitions.
     According to IBISWorld Inc.’s October 2018 report, the United States metals wholesale industry (which includes metals service centers) is expected to generate revenues of approximately $224.4 billion in 2018, nearly a 15% increase over 2017 revenues of $195.4 billion mainly due to higher metals prices. The five largest U.S. metals service center companies are expected by IBISWorld Inc. to represent slightly less than 10% of the estimated $224.4 billion industry total in 2018. While we remain the largest metals service center company in the United States on a revenue basis, IBISWorld Inc. estimates our 2018 U.S. revenues to account for only about 4.7% of the entire U.S. market, leaving significant opportunity for further strategic growth. 
     History and Overview of Reliance
     Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. was organized as a California corporation on February 3, 1939 and commenced business in Los Angeles, California fabricating steel reinforcing bar. Within ten years of our founding, we had become a full‑line distributor of steel and aluminum, operating a single metals service center in Los Angeles. In the early 1950s, we automated our materials handling operations and began to provide processing services to meet our customers’ requirements. In the 1960s, we began to acquire other companies to establish additional service centers, expanding into other geographic areas.
     In the mid‑1970s, we began to establish specialty metals centers stocked with inventories of selected metals such as aluminum, stainless steel or brass and copper, and equipped with automated materials handling and precision cutting equipment specific to the selected metals. In the mid‑1990s, we began to expand nationally and focused on acquiring well‑run, profitable metals service center companies, and we continue to expand our network, with a focus on providing increased levels of value-added services and specialty products to our customers as opposed to merely distributing metal. We reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 2015. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “RS” and was first traded on September 16, 1994.

 We continue to execute our growth strategy and have become the largest North American (U.S. and Canada) metals service center company based on revenues, with over 300 locations and 2018 net sales of $11.53 billion. Although we continue to expand the types of metals that we sell and the processing services that we perform, we have not diversified outside of our core business and we strive to consistently perform as the best in our industry. We focus on smaller customers and order sizes with quick turnarounds and have steadily increased the percentage of our orders with processing performed, which was 49% in 2018.

      Operational Strategy
     Our executive officers maintain a control environment that is focused on integrity and ethical behavior, establish general policies and operating guidelines. In addition, our executive officers monitor performance, provide oversight and ensure adherence to proper financial controls, while our division managers and subsidiary officers have autonomy with respect to day‑to‑day operations. This balanced yet entrepreneurial management style has enabled us to improve our safety performance and the productivity and profitability of both our acquired businesses and of our existing operations. Key management personnel are eligible for incentive compensation based, in part, on the profitability of their particular division or subsidiary and, in part, on the Company’s overall profitability.
     Safety is our top priority and an important element of our day-to-day operational focus. Our executive team supports a safety management system that includes policies, standard practices and goals at our facilities. In addition, our safety professionals monitor compliance with regulatory requirements and conduct safety assessments and training to improve safety practices. 
     We seek to increase profitability through improvements in our customer service, operational efficiencies, pricing discipline, and inventory management as well as by providing increased levels of value-added processing. We continue to adjust our business practices to leverage our size and gain efficiencies which contribute to our profitability. We believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry and are known for our integrity and the quality and timeliness of our service.

     Historically, we have expanded through both acquisitions and internal growth. Since our initial public offering in September 1994, we have successfully purchased 66 businesses, including our 2018 acquisitions of DuBose National Energy Services, Inc. and DuBose National Energy Fasteners & Machined Parts, Inc. (collectively, “DuBose”), KMS Fab, LLC and KMS South, Inc. (collectively, “KMS”) and All Metals Holding, LLC, including its operating subsidiaries All Metals Processing & Logistics, Inc. and All Metals Transportation and Logistics, Inc. (collectively, “All Metals”). Our internal growth activities during the last few years, which are supported by our capital expenditures, have been at historically high levels with 2018 being a record at $239.9 million, and have included opening new facilities, adding to our processing capabilities and relocating existing operations to larger, more efficient facilities. Our investments in processing equipment have allowed us to increase the range of value-added services that we provide to our customers and increase our efficiency, which we believe has contributed to our recent increase in our sustainable gross profit margin range. These investments also differentiate us from our competitors and have allowed us to focus our efforts on higher margin business. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and we expect to continue to grow our business through acquisitions and internal growth initiatives, particularly those that will diversify our products, customer base and geographic locations and increase our sales of high-margin specialty products and value-added processing.
     Customers and Markets
     Our customers purchase from us and other metals service centers to obtain value‑added metals processing, readily available inventory, reliable and timely delivery, flexible minimum order size and quality control. Many of our customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum order sizes specified by mills, because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular time periods, or because those customers require specialized processing services. We believe that metals service centers have also enjoyed an increase in services requested by their customers due to the focus of the capital goods and other manufacturing industries on just‑in‑time inventory management and outsourcing of materials management and metals processing. Due to technology advancements in metals processing equipment, metals service centers that have invested in new processing equipment are able to provide higher quality levels to their customers.
     We have more than 125,000 customers in a variety of industries, including general manufacturing, non‑residential construction (including infrastructure), transportation (rail, truck trailer and shipbuilding), aerospace and defense, energy (oil and natural gas), electronics and semiconductor fabrication, and heavy industry (agricultural, construction and mining equipment). We also service the auto industry, primarily through our toll processing operations where we process the metal for a fee, without taking ownership of the metal.
     Although we sell directly to many large original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers, the majority of our sales are to small machine shops and fabricators, in small quantities with frequent deliveries, helping them manage their working capital and credit needs more efficiently. Our metals service centers wrote and delivered over 5,423,000 orders during 2018 or an average of 21,720 per day, with an average price of approximately $2,130 per order. Most of our metals service center customers are located within a 200‑mile radius of the Reliance metals service center serving them. The proximity of our service centers to our customers helps us provide just‑in‑time delivery and increases the likelihood of repeat business. In 2018, approximately 97% of our orders were from repeat customers. With our fleet of approximately 1,760 trucks (some of which are leased), we are able to service many smaller customers and provide quick turnaround deliveries. We believe that maintaining our own fleet of trucks and drivers provides a competitive advantage in the current environment as third party freight costs have increased due to strong demand and tight supply. Moreover, our computerized order entry systems and flexible production scheduling enable us to meet customer requirements for short lead times and just‑in‑time delivery. We believe that our long‑term relationships with many of our customers significantly contribute to the success of our business. Providing prompt and efficient services and quality products at reasonable prices are important factors in maintaining and expanding these relationships.
     Our acquisitions in recent years have increased our international exposure from both a customer and physical location perspective. In addition, we have built and opened international locations in recent years to service specific industries, typically making limited investments to support existing key U.S. customers that also operate in those international markets. Accordingly, our exposure to risks associated with such investments is minimal. Net sales of our international locations (based on where the shipments originated) accounted for approximately 8% of our consolidated 2018 net sales, 

 
  6

 
or $896.1 million. However, our net sales to international customers (based on the shipping destination) were approximately 10% of our consolidated 2018 net sales or $1.2 billion, with approximately 26% of these sales, or $308.0 million, to Canadian customers. 
     Customer demand may change from time to time based on, among other things, general economic conditions and industry capacity. Many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature. Because we sell to a wide variety of customers in a wide variety of industries, we believe that we are able to somewhat mitigate earnings volatility. In addition, many of our customers are small job shops and fabricators who also have a diverse customer base and the versatility to service different end markets when an existing market slows. Given our business model and focus on small, quick turnaround orders, we primarily operate in the spot market for both the purchase and sale of our products. As we have limited contractual business, this enables us to better pass on higher metal prices to our customers and maintain consistency in our gross profit margin. 
     Due to our focus on small orders, decentralized operating structure and the diversity of the markets we serve, customer concentrations are not significant. Our largest customer represented only 1.0% of our net sales in 2018. In 2018, we had only 26 customers with sales greater than $25 million.
     The geographic breakout of our sales based on the location of our metals service center facilities in each of the three years ended December 31 was as follows:
    
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Midwest | 32 | % | 32 | % | 32 | %
West/Southwest | 22 | % | 22 | % | 22 | %
Southeast | 18 | % | 18 | % | 17 | %
International | 8 | % | 9 | % | 9 | %
Mid-Atlantic | 6 | % | 6 | % | 7 | %
Northeast | 6 | % | 6 | % | 6 | %
Pacific Northwest | 5 | % | 4 | % | 4 | %
Mountain | 3 | % | 3 | % | 3 | %
Total | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

      See Note 17 — “Segment information” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further information on U.S. and foreign revenues and assets.
     Suppliers
     We primarily purchase our inventory from the major domestic metals producers, which we also refer to as mills. We do, however, also purchase limited amounts of certain products from foreign producers. We have multiple suppliers for all of our products. 
     Because of our total volume of purchases and our long‑term relationships with our suppliers, we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by our suppliers. We believe that these relationships provide us an advantage in our ability to source product and have it available for our customers in accelerated timeframes when needed, and also allows us to more efficiently manage our inventory. We believe that we are not dependent on any one supplier for our metal inventory. In addition, we believe that our strong relationships with domestic metal producers helped us maintain our supply of metal products during the first half of 2018 when supply interruptions resulting from the effects of Section 232 tariffs were observed in the marketplace. We believe both our size and our long-term relationships with our suppliers continue to be important because mill consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers.
     Backlog
     Because of the just‑in‑time delivery and the short lead‑time nature of our business, we do not believe information on our backlog of orders is meaningful to an understanding of our business.

     Capital Expenditures
     We maintained our focus on internal growth in 2018 by opening new facilities, building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with record capital expenditures of $239.9 million, with the majority growth-related. Our 2019 capital expenditure budget is approximately $230.0 million, much of which is again related to internal growth activities comprised of purchases of equipment and new facilities along with expansions of existing facilities. This reflects our confidence in our long‑term prospects; however, we will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project and consider the economic conditions and outlook at the time of investment. We estimate our maintenance capital expenditures at approximately $90 to $100 million annually, which allows us to significantly reduce our capital expenditures if economic conditions warrant a more conservative approach to capital allocation and provides flexibility to redirect capital to other strategic priorities.      Products and Processing Services
     We provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers’ specifications and deliver products to fabricators, manufacturers and other end users. We maintain a wide variety of products in inventory, and believe this differentiates us from all other North American service centers. Approximately half of our orders do not require extensive or specialized processing allowing delivery to the customer within 24 hours of receiving the order. This provides a competitive advantage to us, and, for the remainder of our orders we typically have shorter lead times than our competitors given our decentralized structure and investments in processing equipment. Our product mix has become more diverse mainly as a result of our targeted growth strategy to acquire companies that distribute mainly specialty products and provide increased levels of value-added processing services. In addition, we have invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures in the six-year period ended December 31, 2018, with approximately 50% spent on processing equipment. We have increased our investments in processing equipment due to our existing and potential customers requesting higher levels of value-added processing, which has contributed to increases in our profitability. We currently perform processing services for 49% of our orders. We believe our investments in state-of-the-art processing equipment and focus on maintaining pricing discipline related to our processing services were significant contributors to our substantial increases in gross profit margin over the past few years. We also believe our enhanced processing capabilities have increased our ability to sell higher-margin metals processing services to a larger group of customers. Flat‑rolled carbon steel products (i.e., hot‑rolled, cold‑rolled and galvanized steel sheet and coil), which generally have the most volatile and competitive pricing, accounted for only 15% of our 2018 sales.

(1) | Includes revenues for logistics services provided by our toll processing companies.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals. This diversity of product type and material reduces our exposure to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries. We are also less dependent on any particular suppliers as a result of our product diversification.
     For sheet and coil products, we purchase coiled metal from primary producers in the form of a continuous sheet, typically 36 to 60 inches wide, between 0.015 and 0.25 inches thick, and rolled into 3‑to-20 ton coils. The size and weight of these coils require specialized equipment to move and process the material into smaller sizes and various products. Many of the other products that we carry also require specialized equipment for material handling and processing. We believe few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes or the capital available to acquire the necessary equipment.
     We believe that few metals service centers offer the broad range of processing services and metals that we provide. In addition to a focus on growing our revenues from specialty products, we have also increased the amount of value‑added 

 
  9

 
processing services we provide through recent acquisitions and significant investments in new equipment over the past few years. For example, we have made significant investments in facilities and equipment due to the increased demand for our products sold to the aerospace market and toll processing aluminum for the automotive industry.
     After receiving an order, we enter it into one of our computerized order entry systems, select appropriate inventory and schedule processing to meet the specified delivery date. In 2018, we delivered approximately 40% of our orders within 24 hours of the customer placing the order with us. We attempt to maximize the yield from the various metals that we process by combining customer orders to use each product that we purchase to the fullest extent practicable.
     In 2018, we performed processing services for approximately 49% of our sales orders. Our primary processing services range from cutting, leveling or sawing to more complex processes such as machining or electropolishing. Throughout our service centers we perform most processes available in the marketplace, without encroaching upon the services performed by our customers. Consistent with our growth strategy, we continue to increase our offering of higher-margin value‑added services, including certain fabrication processes in select geographic areas at the request of our customers.
     We generally only process specific metals to non‑standard sizes pursuant to customer purchase order specifications. In addition, we typically acquire standard size and grade products that can be processed into many different sizes to meet the needs of many different customers. We do not maintain a significant inventory of finished products, but we carry a wide range of metals to meet our customers’ short lead time and just‑in‑time delivery requirements. Our metals service centers maintain inventory and equipment selected to meet the needs of that facility’s customers. We work with our customers to understand their needs and identify areas where we can provide additional value, increasing our importance to them.
     Sales and Marketing
     As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 2,090 sales personnel located in 44 states in the U.S. and 13 other countries providing sales and marketing services. We believe that our sales force has extensive product, service, market and customer knowledge. Sales personnel are organized by division or subsidiary and are divided into two groups. Outside sales personnel travel throughout a specified geographic territory and maintain relationships with our existing customers and develop new customers. Inside sales personnel remain at the facilities to price and write orders. Outside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit from their particular geographic territories. Inside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit and/or pretax profit of their particular location. 
     Our business is relationship-based and because of that, we operate under many different trade names. We acquire well-run businesses with strong customer relationships and solid reputations within the marketplace. Because of this, we find value in the acquired trade name and continue to use the business name and maintain the customer relationships.
     Competition
     The metals service center industry is highly fragmented and competitive. We have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations, and competition is most frequently local or regional. Our domestic service center competitors are generally smaller than we are, but we also face strong competition from national, regional and local independent metals distributors and the producers themselves, some of which have greater resources than we do. In their October 2018 report on the metals wholesaling industry, IBISWorld Inc. estimated that in 2018 there were approximately 10,000 metal wholesale locations in the United States operated by approximately 7,300 companies. Nevertheless, the five largest U.S. metals service center companies are expected to represent slightly less than 10% of the estimated industry revenue in 2018. IBISWorld Inc. estimates our 2018 U.S. revenues to account for only about 4.7% of the entire U.S. market. We are the largest North American (U.S. and Canada) metals service center company on a revenue basis.
     We compete with other companies on price, service, quality, processing capability and availability of products and services. We maintain relationships with our major suppliers at the executive and local levels. We believe that this division of responsibility has increased our ability to obtain competitive prices of metals by leveraging our total size and to provide more responsive service to our customers by allowing our local management teams to make the purchasing decisions. In

addition, we believe that the size of our inventory, the diversity of metals products we have available, and the wide variety of processing services we provide distinguish us from our competition. We believe our competitors are generally unable to offer the same high quality products and services we provide using state-of-the-art processing equipment as they do not have the financial ability or risk tolerance to grow their businesses at the same rate as Reliance. We believe we have increased our market share during recent years due to our strong financial condition, the high quality of products and services we are able to offer as a result of our significant investments in our acquired businesses, facilities and equipment, as well as our continued focus on small order sizes with quick turnaround.
     Quality Control
     Procuring high quality metal from suppliers on a consistent basis is critical to our business. We have instituted strict quality control measures to assure that the quality of purchased raw materials will enable us to meet our customers’ specifications and to reduce the costs of production interruptions. In certain instances, we perform physical and chemical analyses on selected raw materials, typically through a third party testing lab, to verify that mechanical and dimensional properties, cleanliness and surface characteristics meet our requirements and our customers’ specifications. We also conduct certain analyses of surface characteristics on selected processed metal before delivery to the customer. We believe that maintaining high standards for accepting metals ultimately results in reduced return rates from our customers.
     We maintain various quality certifications throughout our operations. Approximately 50% of our operating locations are ISO 9001:2015 certified. Many of our locations maintain additional certifications specific to the industries they serve, such as aerospace, auto, nuclear, and others, including certain international certifications.
     Systems
     A common financial reporting system, as well as certain other accounting, tax and human resources systems are used company‑wide. However, we maintain various transactional software applications across our operations that meet the individual needs of those operations. Generally, these localized systems provide information in real time, such as inventory availability, location and cost and may be customized with features to accommodate the products the respective operations carry and services they provide, automated equipment interfaces, or other specialized requirements. With this information, our marketing and sales personnel can respond to our customers’ needs more efficiently and more effectively. Many of our companies also provide online access to our existing customers to allow them to interact with us more efficiently, and also provide the ability for potential customers to make inquiries and place orders. We continue to improve the functionality of our systems and enhance our online services to provide increased functionality and flexibility to our customers.      Government Regulation
     Our metals service centers are subject to many foreign, federal, state and local requirements to protect the environment, including hazardous waste disposal and underground storage tank regulations. The only hazardous substances that we generally use in our operations are lubricants, cleaning solvents and diesel for fueling our trucks. We pay state‑certified private companies to haul and dispose of the limited amounts of hazardous waste our operations produce.
     Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and related regulations, which, among other requirements, establish noise, dust and safety standards. We maintain comprehensive health and safety policies and encourage our employees to follow established safety practices. Safety of our employees and others is critical to our success. We continue to expand and improve our internal safety resources, which has contributed positively to our safety metrics and financial results. We encourage social well‑being by instituting these high quality labor, health and safety standards. We do not anticipate that continued compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
     We are subject to the conflict mineral provisions of the Dodd‑Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. We are required to undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether the products we sell originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We verify with our suppliers the origins of all metals used in our products.

     We sell metals to foreign customers and otherwise operate abroad, subjecting us to various countries’ trade regulations concerning the import and export of materials and finished products. Our operations are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace, including the United States’ Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010. We have developed and implemented company‑wide export and anti‑corruption policies designed to provide our employees clear statements of our compliance requirements and to ensure compliance with applicable export and anti‑corruption regulations. For information about risks related to government regulation, please see the risk factors set forth under the caption Item 1A. “Risk Factors” including the Risk Factors captioned “We are subject to various environmental, employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations, which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures;” “We operate internationally and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations, exchange controls, political risks and other risks relating to international operations;” and “Our international operations continue to expand, exposing us to additional risks.”
     Environmental
     Some of the properties we own or lease are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use. We may incur some environmental liabilities because of the location of these properties. In addition, we are currently involved with a certain environmental remediation project related to activities at former manufacturing operations of Earle M. Jorgensen Company (“EMJ”), our wholly owned subsidiary, that were sold many years prior to our acquisition of EMJ in 2006. Although the potential cleanup costs could be significant, EMJ maintained insurance policies during the time they owned the manufacturing operations that have covered substantially all of our expenditures related to this matter to date, and are expected to continue to cover the majority of the related costs. We do not expect that these obligations will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
     We believe that all scrap metal produced by our operations is recycled by the independent scrap metal companies and producers to whom we sell our scrap metal. We continue to evaluate and implement energy conservation and other initiatives to reduce pollution and improve our environmental impact. Enactment of more stringent environmental regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
     Although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur any violations and resulting penalties from such activity.
     Corporate Responsibility
     Sustainability
     We are committed to mitigating the impact our products and operations have on the environment. As an operator of metals service centers, our day-to-day business consists of the sale, distribution and processing of a broad variety of metal products sourced from numerous primary metal producers. Approximately half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first‑stage” processing, which does not require significant amounts of energy or toxic or hazardous materials as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Our operations, by their nature, do not emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases or have a significant impact on the environment. We believe our energy use is significantly less than that of metals producers.

 As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, we: 
    
· | purchase significant volumes of metal produced in electric arc furnaces that consume recycled material;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | sell scrap material generated in our operations to recyclers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | use propane fuel to operate forklifts and have installed natural and energy efficient lighting in many of our operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | utilize energy efficient diesel tractors that consume less fuel and reduce emissions for the majority of our trucking fleet.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Community Programs
     Reliance is committed to investing in and enriching the communities in which we live and work. We support a variety of organizations and community programs including:
· | Veterans support — We are supporters of a non-profit organization that provides veterans and transitioning services members with advanced manufacturing training and industry-recognized certification for careers in welding, machining and fabrication at no cost to them. Since 2013, Reliance has partnered with this organization through financial sponsorship, donations of metals for their training courses, and hiring this organization’s graduates. For the past four years, we have also participated in a national program focused on supporting enlisted members of the Armed Forces and their families.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reliance Cares — In 2017, we launched an employee relief fund to support our workforce of approximately 15,600 individuals across 44 states and 13 countries outside of the U.S. (“Reliance Cares”). Reliance Cares is available to any of our employees impacted by a natural disaster.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Local Community Organizations — Reliance encourages our subsidiaries and divisions to engage with organizations, and participate in events, serving their local communities, especially those promoting the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families. Reliance often contributes to the fundraising efforts of our subsidiaries and divisions and supports volunteer efforts by our employees.

      Employees
     As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,600 employees. Approximately 11% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire at various times over the next seven years. Approximately 400 employees are covered by 13 different collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2019. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with 40 union locals at 51 of our locations. These collective bargaining agreements have not had a material impact either favorably or unfavorably on our revenues or profitability at our various locations. We aim to always maintain excellent relations with our employees and have never experienced a significant work stoppage. Over the years we have experienced minor work stoppages by our employees at certain of our locations, but due to the small number of employees and the short time periods involved, these stoppages have not had a material impact on our operations.      Seasonality
     Some of our customers are in seasonal businesses, especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses. Our overall operations have not shown any material seasonal trends as a result of our geographic, product and customer diversity. Typically, revenues in the months of July, November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products, resulting from holidays observed by the Company as well as vacation and extended holiday closures at some of our customers. Reduced shipping days also have a significant impact on our profitability. We cannot predict whether period-to-period fluctuations will be consistent with historical patterns. Results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results.
