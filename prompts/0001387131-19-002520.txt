Item 1. General
Company Background
 
Nanophase Technologies Corporation (“Nanophase” or the “Company”, including “we”, “our” or “us”) is a skin and sun care focused company that offers engineered materials, formulation development and commercial manufacturing with an integrated family of technologies. The Company was incorporated in Illinois on November 25, 1989 and became a Delaware corporation during November 1997. Our common stock trades on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol NANX. We have development and application laboratories and manufacturing capacity in two locations in the Chicago, Illinois, area.
 
In recent years, we have advanced and expanded our expertise in nanoscale engineering to include non-nano materials as well as an array of skin care formulations designed to address skin health while imparting an excellent sensory experience. We produce materials for use in three business areas: personal care ingredients, including ingredients for use in sunscreens as active ingredients; fully formulated cosmetics of our own design which are developed, marketed and distributed under the Solésence® brand name by our wholly owned subsidiary Solesence, LLC (identified throughout this report as our Solésence® subsidiary); and in our advanced materials products, which includes architectural coatings, industrial coating applications, abrasion-resistant additives, plastics additives, medical diagnostics, energy (including solar control) and a variety of surface finishing technologies (polishing) applications, including optics. 
 
Although our technology can be applied to a wide variety of applications, we have focused our efforts on only a handful of applications to gain a depth of knowledge and maximize our potential to grow rapidly. In particular, we have refined our development focus primarily to the personal care market. If we find a unique application outside of our core markets that does not require significant development resources, then we may pursue it as “opportunistic” business, but we currently have not made a definitive decision to extend our primary development focus outside the personal care market. We believe this focused approach will contribute to a higher success rate for related opportunities than we would experience by pursuing more opportunities simultaneously.
 
Our manufacturing is based on Lean Six Sigma discipline and is registered under the ISO 9001, American National Standard, Quality Management System Requirements; the ISO 14001, American National Standard, Environmental Management System Requirements; and is compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) for products under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulation.
 
Personal Care Ingredients Business
 
Our largest line of business is the manufacture and sale of personal care ingredients. We manufacture and supply hundreds of metric tons of surface engineered zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to our customers annually that are used by major global consumer products companies for sunscreens and personal care products. We produce these products using proprietary coating and dispersion technologies that comply with the requirement of cGMP.
Solésence® Business
 
Commencing in 2015, we expanded our offerings beyond personal care ingredients to include fully formulated skin care products developed, marketed and sold by our Solésence® subsidiary. Although our Solésence® products are fully formulated for consumer use, we do not sell directly to consumers or distribute products to consumers under the Solésence® brand through intermediaries or resellers. Instead, we sell our Solésence® products to manufacturers, formulators and distributors of consumer personal care products as market-ready products, as customized white label products or as custom-developed products, in each case, for sale or distribution to consumers under our customers’ brand names.
 
During 2015 we were granted a patent on a new type of particle surface treatment (coating) — now called Active Stress Defense™ Technology — which has become the cornerstone of our new product development in our Solésence® business, with first revenue recognized during 2016. We have developed and expanded our in-house formulating capability, through which we have created multiple fully formulated finished cosmetics products for sale in markets focused on skin care and environmental protection. Products developed and sold by our Solésence® subsidiary are all produced under the requirements of cGMP, which enables us to leverage the expertise we developed in the manufacture personal care ingredients.

Advanced Materials Business
 
Our third line of business is the manufacture and sale of other advanced nanoparticle materials. Our advanced materials have applications in diverse global markets where they are incorporated into a process, such as optics polishing, or a product, such as an industrial coating to prevent degradation or aid in application, or significantly improve wear resistance.
 
We have developed proprietary technology to disperse nanoparticles in both aqueous (water-based) and several organic solvent systems. These dispersions are stable at high weight loading (typically 18-55% by weight). These aspects provide distinct market advantages. Dispersed nanomaterials are desired by many customers for use in their processes or products because of the ease of incorporation.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.
 
Most of the raw materials we use are readily commercially available. In some cases, we rely on sole-source processors of materials that utilize an array of worldwide sources for the raw materials that they process to our specifications. In certain cases, moreover, certain raw materials that we deal with have a very limited supply, such as cerium oxide, classified as “Rare Earth elements,” for use in surface finishing technologies (polishing) applications, as well as the very high purity zinc that we use in personal care applications. Although we currently believe we have developed adequate commercial relationships to supply the necessary raw materials for our business which are not readily commercially available, our business is subject to the pricing and availability of certain raw materials—see Item 1A—Risk Factors, in this report.
Markets and Distribution
 
We have steadily expanded our ability to commercially utilize and deliver our finished goods and technologies. Through large-scale manufacturing, we have developed production expertise that has allowed us to improve processes relating to those materials as well as processes relating to other materials. This experience has translated into additional know-how, intellectual property and advances in the technologies and manufacturing processes that reduce variable manufacturing costs and improve gross margins.
Personal Care Ingredients Business
 
In addition to serving customers in diverse markets and geographic locations, we will continue to devote significant resources to maintaining and growing our relationship with BASF Corporation (“BASF”), the largest customer in our personal care ingredients line of business. This has been a successful relationship that we expect will contribute to our future growth. BASF, which describes itself as the world’s leading chemical company with revenue of approximately $70 billion, is a global leader in the personal care market with recognized brands, significant revenues and sales reach. We have a long-term exclusive relationship with BASF, primarily to provide zinc oxide-based products to be used in personal care with sunscreens and daily wear products being the dominant applications.
Solésence® Business
 
We market our fully formulated finished products directly to various brands in the skin care and cosmetics markets on a global basis. This represents a progression from providing ingredients to manufacturers of finished products, to offering Solésence®-branded finished products to marketers and sellers of skin care products. With our first Solésence® product revenue recognized during 2016, we had our first material amounts of Solésence® product revenue in 2017, and we expect these sales to expand in 2019. Historically, we have seen our customer-focused marketing approach increase our probability of success in many markets, allowing us to use an integrated platform of technologies and typically reduce the total time-to-market. We expect our Solésence® products business to enhance both our degree of control of the business development cycle, and to further reduce our total time-to-market.

Advanced Materials Business
 
Our technologies for engineering and manufacturing nanomaterials, and our understanding of how to make nanomaterials exhibit desirable performance characteristics in various media, have resulted in commercial nanomaterials solutions that we believe offer superior performance in many applications. Our products are used in a variety of applications, including architectural coatings, polishing applications (including optical glass and CMP (Chemical Mechanical Planarization)), plastics additives, medical diagnostics, textiles and graphic arts, energy control applications, and others. As advanced materials markets continue to develop and grow, we believe that customers’ preferred delivery formats will often be dispersed and/or coated nanomaterials. We believe we are well-positioned with our platform of integrated commercial nanomaterial technologies to respond to this demand. We plan to maintain our intellectual property and technologies to remain competitive in the fields of nanomaterials development, applications development and commercialization.
Research and Development
 
Most of our research and development is directly related to Solésence® product and personal care ingredient applications development. We endeavor to either meet specific customer needs or to develop applications solutions to address unmet needs in a particular market where we believe our materials will offer a distinct performance advantage. Our efforts in research and development, cosmetic formulating, process engineering and advanced engineering groups are focused in three major areas: 1) application development for our products; 2) creating or obtaining additional core material technologies and/or materials that have the capability to serve multiple skin care-related markets; and 3) continuing to improve our core technologies to improve manufacturing operations and reduce costs.
 
Our total research and development expense, which includes all expenses relating to our technology and advanced engineering groups, during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, was $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. This represents our share of these expenses only and does not take into account amounts spent by any of our customers in support of new product development. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to develop products which bring a high degree of value to our customers’ products. Through the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, we had cumulative research and development expenses of approximately $5.3 million and cumulative expenditures on equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately $0.3 million.
 
Competitive Advantage
 
In our personal care ingredients business, we believe that aggressively pursuing applications in targeted areas will help us to compete as a technical and commercial innovator using our materials expertise and, more importantly, to be perceived as a solutions provider by our customers, giving us a distinct market advantage over companies that are simply materials suppliers.
 
In our Solésence® business, we have a proprietary Active Stress Defense ™ technology, which offers unique product performance-related and aesthetic advantages in environmental protection skin care. By combining our proprietary dispersion capabilities and formulation know-how, our Solésence® products enable our customers to expand the range of skin care and color cosmetics categories that can include sun protection, and their products consequently fill a unique market segment which drives demand for our Solésence® products as raw materials.
 
In our advanced materials business, we have created an integrated platform of commercial nanomaterial technologies that are patented, patent-pending or proprietary. These technologies revolve around our two distinct manufacturing process (PVS – Plasma Vapor Synthesis and NAS - NanoArc® Synthesis) and are designed to deliver a nanomaterial solution for a targeted market or a specific customer application. Our platform provides flexibility and capability to engineer nanomaterials that meet a customer’s performance requirements and delivers our nanomaterial solutions in a readily usable format. Our technologies are scalable and robust, having produced several hundred metric tons annually.

Manufacturing Operations
 
We have manufacturing capacity based in two locations in the Chicago area. At each of these facilities, we are able to develop and supply engineered materials and bulk finished goods in quantities ranging from grams to metric tons. Our facilities are registered under ISO 9001 international standards and are cGMP compliant for applicable bulk pharmaceutical chemical ingredient and sunscreen manufacturing. We are also in the process of registering some of the chemicals we ship to customers in Europe pursuant to the European Chemical Agency’s regulations issued to date pertaining to Registration Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”). We have registered Zinc Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Iron Oxide and Octyltrimethoxysilane under REACH. Our facilities are also registered under the international standard for environmental management, ISO 14001.
 
Our operations employ a cellular, team-based manufacturing approach, where workers operate in work “cells,” under a lean manufacturing environment to continuously advance and improve production capabilities. We have also developed a highly flexible workforce that has been cross-trained to allow it to be employed broadly across our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing approach and targeted engineering actions have resulted in continuing process innovations and improvements that have reduced the variable manufacturing cost significantly over the past several years.
 
We are committed to a lean manufacturing approach, to the extent possible given a certain measure of irregular demand, where we are able to reduce excess labor and manage the lowest practical inventory and supply levels in order to minimize working capital demands. This approach complements two of our major operational goals - (1) to increase output without adding unnecessarily to existing equipment and (2) to continually reduce production costs while consistently producing high quality products.
 
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property. In addition to obtaining patent and trademarks based on our inventions and products, we may also license certain third-party patents from time-to-time to expand our technology base.
 
As of the date of this filing, we own 11 U.S. patents and 4 pending U.S. patent applications. We also own 47 foreign patents and patent applications consisting of 27 issued or allowed foreign patents and 20 pending foreign patent applications. All of the pending and owned foreign patents are counterparts to domestic filings covering our platform of nanotechnologies and surface treatments. We have 2 U.S. patents, along with their 6 foreign counterparts, that are set to expire in 2019. We do not believe that the expiration of these patents will have a material impact on our business or financial condition.
 
Competition
 
Within each of our targeted markets and product applications, we face potential competition from advanced materials and chemical companies, and suppliers of traditional materials. In many markets, the actual or potential competitors are larger and more diversified than we are; however, we believe we focus in market segments and opportunities where our materials and related technologies are superior to those of our competitors, often due to our ability to produce highly engineered products to meet specific performance requirements and develop advanced material solutions for customers’ specific applications.
 
With respect to traditional suppliers, we may compete against lower priced traditional materials for certain customer applications. In some product or process applications the benefits of using nanomaterials do not always justify a process change or outweigh their frequently higher costs.

With respect to larger producers of nanomaterials, while many of these producers do not currently offer directly competitive products, these companies may have greater financial and technical resources, larger research and development staffs, and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and could compete directly against us. In addition, the number of development-stage companies involved in nanocrystalline materials continues to grow on a global basis, posing increasing competitive risks. Many of these companies are associated with university or national laboratories and use chemical and physical methods to produce nanocrystalline materials. We believe that most of these companies are engaged primarily in funded research and not commercial production; however, they may represent competitive risks in the future. Some development-stage companies, especially in other countries, receive significant government assistance or enjoy other benefits due to their location. We anticipate that foreign competition will play a greater role in the nanomaterials arena in the future, something we are increasingly seeing today, albeit indirectly.
 
We believe that our nanomaterial technologies and manufacturing platforms are strong. We believe we are well-positioned with our platform of integrated commercial nanomaterial technologies and track record of technology improvement and evolution.
 
In addition to competition in the advanced materials and related markets, our Solésence® subsidiary faces competition from a wide variety of offerings in the field of skin care. Our Solésence® products compete with existing solutions as well as new solutions from various sources, including other product developers who seek to serve skin care brands and integrated brands who also manufacture their own products in-house, and we must differentiate their value proposition in order to gain traction in this marketplace. We believe that our Solésence® technology, coupled with our expanding product formulations capability, will allow us to become a competitive player in this market.
 
Governmental Regulations, Including Climate Change
 
The manufacture and use of certain of the products that contain our metal oxides are subject to governmental regulations. As a result, we are required to adhere to the cGMP requirements of the FDA and similar regulations that include testing, control and documentation requirements enforced by periodic inspections. We are also in the process of registering some of the chemicals we ship to customers in Europe in compliance with the European Chemical Agency’s regulations issued to date pertaining to REACH (to date, we have registered Zinc Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Iron Oxide and Octyltrimethoxysilane under REACH).
 
We are committed to environmental health and safety (“EH&S”). We believe we comply with all applicable exposure limit standards issued by OSHA. Because nanotechnology remains an emerging and evolving science, there are no currently accepted standards, measurements or personal protective equipment available that are specific to nanoparticle safety. Accordingly, we rely on general chemical safety and process safety practices to identify safe personal protective equipment and appropriate handling protocols. We believe that we have taken a leadership position on EH&S in our operations and have internal and external review and monitoring of our practices.
 
In addition, our facilities and operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various environmental and occupational safety and health laws. We believe we are in compliance with all such laws and regulations, and to date, those regulations have not materially restricted or impeded operations. Further, we believe our processes to be highly efficient, generating very low levels of waste and emissions. For this reason, we do not view issues surrounding climate change and any currently foreseeable related regulations as materially impacting our business and financial statements, beyond any inestimable impact on the macro-economic environment.
 
We have taken a responsible, proactive approach to EH&S by implementing appropriate procedures and processes to have our facilities registered under ISO 14001, American National Standard, Environmental Management System Requirements. We are also involved with leading industry groups that are defining nanomaterial standards and protocols. These currently include the ASTM International Committee on Nanotechnology, and the US TAG to ISO TC 229 Nanotechnology committee managed by the American National Standards Institute committee (ANSI). We also participate in FDA reviews relative to cosmetic and applicable drug applications. We have a full-time, advanced degreed professional who spends a significant amount of time managing governmental regulation compliance and EH&S. We believe that our Company has an exemplary safety record.

Employees
 
On December 31, 2018, we had a total of 54 full-time employees, 5 of whom hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have a number of temporary-to-permanent employees and contractors with specific industry experience that have become a part of our talent pool. We have no collective bargaining agreements and believe that we have a strong relationship with our employees, whom management believes represent the strength of our Company.
Backlog
 
We do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. Our sales are primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of our personal care ingredients, advanced materials and Solésence® formulated products. We have some agreements that give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of nanomaterials during a specified time period. These agreements, however, do not obligate the customers to purchase any minimum quantity of such nanomaterials. The quantities actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer’s needs. For these reasons we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts.
Business Segment and Geographical Information
 
Our operations comprise a single business segment and all of our long-lived assets are located within the United States. See Note 13 to the accompanying Financial Statements for additional information.
Key Customers
 
A limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of our commercial revenue, and aside from our largest customer, we are seeing the composition of these key customers change with the growth we are experiencing within our Solésence® subsidiary. In particular, revenue from three customers - the largest customer in our personal care ingredients business (BASF), the first significant customer for our Solésence® products (Colorescience), and the largest customer of our advanced materials business (Byk-Chemie) constituted approximately 74%, 7% and 3%, respectively, of our 2018 total revenue. Many of our customers are significantly larger than we are and, therefore, may be able to exert a high degree of influence over us. While our agreements with BASF are long-term agreements, they may be terminated by BASF under certain circumstances with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that BASF will buy our products. The loss of one of our largest customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the high concentration of sales to a limited number of customers, we have aggressively pursued new customers through our customer direct business model. To the extent we are successful in adding a large number of customers through this model and maintaining or expanding our existing partners, we believe we will be able to best manage the risks associated with customer concentration.
