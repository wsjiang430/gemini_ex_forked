Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading operator of discount variety stores. We believe the convenience and value we offer are key factors in growing our base of loyal customers. At February 2, 2019, we operated 15,237 discount variety retail stores. Our stores operate under the names of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar and Dollar Tree Canada.
On July 6, 2015, we completed our purchase of Family Dollar Stores, Inc. and its more than 8,200 stores. This transformational transaction created the largest discount retailer (by store count) in North America. The Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands have complementary business models. Everything is $1.00 at Dollar Tree stores while Family Dollar is a neighborhood variety store offering merchandise largely for $10.00 or less. 
We operate in two reporting business segments: Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. For discussion of the operating results of our reporting business segments, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Segment Information” beginning on page 27 of this Form 10-K and “Note 11 - Segment Reporting” in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” beginning on page 42 of this Form 10-K.
Dollar Tree
  Our Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The Dollar Tree segment includes 7,001 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands, 12 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada and a store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia. Our stores predominantly range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet. In our Dollar Tree stores in the United States, we sell all items for $1.00 or less and in our Dollar Tree Canada stores, we sell all items for $1.25(CAD) or less. Our revenue and assets in Canada are not material.
We strive to exceed our customers’ expectations of the variety and quality of products they can purchase for $1.00 by offering items we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere. We buy approximately 58% to 60% of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40% to 42%. Our domestic purchases include basic, seasonal, home, closeouts and promotional merchandise. We believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed our customers’ expectations. In addition, direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging, product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers’ needs.
The addition of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our Dollar Tree stores has been one of our ongoing initiatives. We added freezers and coolers to 460 additional stores in 2018. As of February 2, 2019, we have freezers and coolers in approximately 5,665 of our Dollar Tree stores. We plan to install them in 500 new and existing stores during fiscal 2019. Over the past year, we rolled out a new layout to a number of our Dollar Tree stores, which we call our Snack Zone. This layout highlights our immediate consumption snack offerings in the front of the store near the checkout areas. As of February 2, 2019, we have this layout in approximately 930 Dollar Tree stores and we plan to implement Snack Zone in 1,000 new and existing stores in fiscal 2019. We believe these initiatives have and will continue to enable us to increase sales and earnings by increasing the number of shopping trips made by our customers.
At any point in time, we carry approximately 7,300 items in our Dollar Tree stores and as of the end of fiscal 2018 approximately 40% of our items are automatically replenished. The remaining items are pushed to the stores and a portion can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis. Through automatic replenishment and our store managers’ ability to order product, each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base.
We maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic, everyday items with seasonal, closeout and promotional merchandise. We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores. Closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10% of our purchases.
The merchandise mix in our Dollar Tree stores consists of:
•consumable merchandise, which includes candy and food, health and beauty care, and everyday consumables such as
household paper and chemicals, and in select stores, frozen and refrigerated food;

• | variety merchandise, which includes toys, durable housewares, gifts, stationery, party goods, greeting cards, softlines, and other items; and

6

•seasonal goods, which includes, among others, Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas merchandise.
For information regarding the amounts and percentages of our net sales contributed by the above merchandise categories for the last three fiscal years, please refer to “Note 11 - Segment Reporting” within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” beginning on page 42 of this Form 10-K.
Family Dollar
Our Family Dollar segment operates general merchandise discount retail stores providing customers with a selection of competitively-priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores. Our stores predominantly range from 6,000 - 8,000 selling square feet. In our 8,236 Family Dollar stores, we sell merchandise at prices that generally range from $1.00 to $10.00. The Family Dollar segment consists of our store operations under the Family Dollar brand, 11 distribution centers and a store support center in Matthews, North Carolina. During fiscal 2019, we plan to consolidate our Matthews, North Carolina store support center with our store support center in Chesapeake, Virginia in our newly-completed office tower in the Summit Pointe development in Chesapeake, Virginia.
Our Family Dollar stores provide customers with a quality, high-value assortment of basic necessities and seasonal merchandise. We offer competitively-priced national brands from leading manufacturers alongside name brand equivalent-value, lower-priced private labels. We purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of merchandise. In fiscal 2018, we purchased approximately 13% of our merchandise through our relationship with McLane Company, Inc., which distributes consumable merchandise from multiple manufacturers. In addition, approximately 18% of our merchandise is imported directly.
We are executing several initiatives in our Family Dollar stores to increase sales. During fiscal 2018, we completed more than 500 Family Dollar renovations, and have completed more than 875 renovations since launching this initiative in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. After continued development, experimentation and testing, we have recently rolled out a new model for both new and renovated Family Dollar stores known as H2. At the end of fiscal 2018, we had approximately 200 stores with this format. This new H2 model has significantly improved merchandise offerings, including Dollar Tree $1.00 merchandise sections and establishing a minimum number of freezer and cooler doors, throughout the store. The stores with the H2 format have increased traffic and provided an average comparable store net sales lift in excess of 10% over control stores. The H2 format performs well in a variety of locations, and especially in locations where Family Dollar has in the past been the most challenged. We plan to renovate at least 1,000 stores to this format in 2019 and roll-out this format in new stores and we will pursue an accelerated renovation schedule in future years.
While the number of items in a given store can vary based on the store’s size, geographic location, merchandising initiatives and other factors, our typical Family Dollar store generally carries approximately 7,700 basic items alongside items that are ever-changing and seasonally-relevant throughout the year.
The merchandise mix in our Family Dollar stores consists of:
•consumable merchandise, which includes food and beverages, tobacco, health and beauty aids, household chemicals,
paper products, hardware and automotive supplies, diapers, batteries, and pet food and supplies;
•home products, which includes housewares, home décor, giftware, and domestics, including comforters, sheets and
towels;
•apparel and accessories merchandise, which includes clothing, fashion accessories and shoes; and
•seasonal and electronics merchandise, which includes Valentine’s Day, Easter, Halloween and Christmas merchandise,
personal electronics, including pre-paid cellular phones and services, stationery and school supplies, and toys.
For information regarding the amounts and percentages of our net sales contributed by the above merchandise categories for the last three fiscal years, please refer to “Note 11 - Segment Reporting” within “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” beginning on page 42 of this Form 10-K.
Business Strategy
Continue to execute our proven and best‑in‑class retail business strategy. We will continue to execute our proven strategies that have generated a history of success and continued growth for the Company. Key elements of our strategy include: 
•aiming continuously to “Wow” the customer with a compelling, fun and fresh merchandise assortment comprising a
variety of the things you want and things you need, all at incredible values in bright, clean and friendly stores; 
7

•maintaining a flexible sourcing merchandise model that allows a variety of products to be sold as long as desired
merchandise margin thresholds are met;

• | growing both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands;

•pursuing a “more, better, faster” approach to the roll-out of new Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores to broaden our
geographic footprint; 

• | maintaining customer relevance by ensuring that we reinvent ourselves constantly through new merchandise categories and initiatives;


• | leveraging the complementary merchandise expertise of each segment including Dollar Tree’s sourcing and product development expertise and Family Dollar’s consumer package goods and national brands sourcing expertise; and

•maintaining a prudent approach with our use of capital for the benefit of our shareholders.
Operate a diversified and complementary business model across both fixed‑price and multi‑price point strategies. We plan to operate and grow both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar brands. We will utilize the reach and scale of our combined company to serve a broader range of customers in more ways, offering better prices and more value for the customer. Dollar Tree stores will continue to operate as single price point retail stores. At Dollar Tree, everything is $1.00, offering the customer a balanced mix of things they need and things they want. Our shopping experience will remain fun and friendly as we exceed our customers’ expectations for what they can buy for $1.00. Dollar Tree serves a broad range of income customers in suburban locations. Family Dollar stores will continue to operate using multiple price points, serving customers as their “neighborhood discount store,” offering great values on everyday items and a convenient shopping experience. Family Dollar primarily serves a lower than average income customer in urban and rural locations. We will benefit from an expanded target customer profile and utilize the store concepts of both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar to serve a broader range of customer demographics to drive further improvements in sales and profitability.
Deliver significant synergy opportunities through continued integration of Family Dollar. Our acquisition of Family Dollar has provided us with significant opportunities to achieve meaningful cost synergies. We executed a detailed integration plan and exceeded our target of approximately $300 million of estimated annual run‑rate cost synergies by July 2018, achieving more than $450 million in synergies. These synergies did not account for one-time costs to achieve synergies, investments back into the business, integration costs, or cost increases due to inflation, vendor increases, or other factors that are not caused by the business combination. Sources of synergies continue to include the following:

• | Savings from sourcing and procurement of merchandise and non-merchandise goods and services driven by leveraging the combined volume of the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments, among other things;


• | Re-bannering to optimize store formats;


• | A reduction in overhead and corporate selling, general and administrative expenses by eliminating redundant positions, optimizing processes, integrating our technology resources and consolidating our store support centers; and


• | Savings resulting from the optimization of distribution and logistics networks.

Take advantage of significant white-space opportunity. Over the past decade we have built a solid and scalable infrastructure, which provides a strong foundation for our future growth. We are committed to growing our combined business to take advantage of significant white space opportunities that we believe exist for both the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar store concepts. Using our proven real estate strategy across our combined business, we intend to drive future store openings by capitalizing on data‑driven insights regarding location, target customer profile, competitive dynamics and cost structure. Over the long-term, we believe that the market can support more than 10,000 Dollar Tree stores and 15,000 Family Dollar stores across the United States, and approximately 1,000 Dollar Tree stores in Canada.
Convenient Locations and Store Size. We focus primarily on opening new Dollar Tree stores in strip shopping centers anchored by large retailers who draw target customers we believe to be similar to ours. Our stores are successful in metropolitan areas, mid-sized cities and small towns. We open new Family Dollar stores in strip shopping centers, freestanding buildings and downtown buildings. The range of our new store sizes, 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet for Dollar Tree and 7,000 - 9,000 selling square feet for Family Dollar, allows us to target a particular location with a store that best suits that market and takes advantage of available real estate opportunities. Our stores are attractively designed and create an inviting atmosphere for shoppers by using bright lighting, vibrant colors and decorative signs. We enhance the store design with attractive merchandise displays. We believe this design attracts new and repeat customers and enhances our image as both a destination and impulse purchase store.

Profitable Stores with Strong Cash Flow. We maintain a disciplined, cost-sensitive approach to store site selection in order to minimize the initial capital investment required and maximize our potential to generate high operating margins and strong cash flows. We believe that our stores have a relatively small shopping radius, which allows us to profitably concentrate multiple stores within a single market. Our ability to open new stores is dependent upon, among other factors, locating suitable sites and negotiating favorable lease terms.
The strong cash flows generated by our stores allow us to self-fund infrastructure investment and new stores. Over the past five years, cash flows from operating activities have exceeded capital expenditures.
For more information on our results of operations, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” beginning on page 27 of this Form 10-K.
Cost Control. We believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy, which includes targeted merchandise margin goals by category. We also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs. We buy products on an order-by-order basis and have no material long-term purchase contracts or other assurances of continued product supply or guaranteed product cost. No vendor accounted for more than 10% of total merchandise purchased in any of the past five years.
Our supply chain systems continue to provide us with valuable sales information to assist our buyers and improve merchandise allocation to our stores. We use this information to target our inventory levels in our distribution centers and stores in order to plan for capacity and labor needs.
Information Systems. We believe that investments in technology help us to increase sales and control costs. Our inventory management system provides information to calculate our estimate of inventory cost under the retail inventory method, which is widely used in the retail industry. Our automated replenishment system replenishes key items, based on actual store-level sales and inventory.
Point-of-sale data allows us to track sales and inventory by merchandise category at the store level and assists us in planning for future purchases of inventory. We believe that this information allows us to ship the appropriate product to stores at the quantities commensurate with selling patterns. Using this point-of-sale data to plan purchases has helped us manage our inventory levels.
Corporate Culture and Values. We believe that honesty and integrity, and treating people fairly and with respect are core values within our corporate culture. We believe that running a business, and certainly a public company, carries with it a responsibility to be above reproach when making operational and financial decisions. Our executive management team visits and shops at our stores like every customer, and ideas and individual creativity on the part of our associates are encouraged, particularly from our store managers who know their stores and their customers. We have standards for store displays, merchandise presentation, and store operations. We maintain an open door policy for all associates. Our distribution centers are operated based on objective measures of performance and virtually everyone in our store support centers is available to assist associates in our stores and distribution centers.
Our disclosure committee meets at least quarterly and monitors our internal controls over financial reporting to ensure that our public filings contain discussions about the potential risks our business faces. We believe that we have appropriate controls in place to be able to certify our financial statements. Additionally, we have complied with the listing requirements for the Nasdaq Global Select Market.
Seasonality. For information on the impact of seasonality, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 12 of this Form 10-K and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” beginning on page 27 of this Form 10-K.
Growth Strategy
Store Openings and Square Footage Growth. The primary factors contributing to our net sales growth have been new store openings, an active store expansion and remodel program, and selective mergers and acquisitions. In the last five years, net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 27.6%, including the addition of Family Dollar. We expect that the majority of our future sales growth will come from new store openings in our Dollar Tree and Family Dollar segments and our store expansion and relocation program as well as our renovation initiatives.
At January 31, 2015, we operated 5,367 stores in the United States and Canada. At February 2, 2019, we operated 15,012 stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, as well as 225 stores in Canada. Our selling square footage increased from 
9

approximately 46.5 million square feet at January 31, 2015 to 120.1 million square feet at February 2, 2019. Our store growth has resulted from opening new stores and our July 2015 acquisition of more than 8,200 Family Dollar stores.
Our growth and productivity statistics are reported based on selling square footage because our management believes the use of selling square footage yields a more accurate measure of store productivity. We expect to increase the selling square footage in our stores in the future by opening new stores in underserved markets and strategically increasing our presence in our existing markets via new store openings and store expansions (expansions include store relocations). In fiscal 2019 and beyond, we plan to predominantly open Dollar Tree stores that are approximately 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet and Family Dollar stores that are approximately 7,000 - 9,000 selling square feet. We believe these store sizes allow us to achieve our objectives in the markets in which we plan to expand.
In addition to new store openings, we plan to continue our Dollar Tree store expansion program to increase our net sales per store and take advantage of market opportunities. We target stores for expansion based on the current sales per selling square foot and changes in market opportunities. Stores targeted for expansion are generally less than 7,000 selling square feet in size. Store expansions generally increase the existing store size by approximately 2,600 selling square feet. At February 2, 2019, 3,909 of our Dollar Tree stores, totaling 64% of our Dollar Tree segment selling square footage, were 8,000 selling square feet or larger.
Since 1995, we have added a total of 695 stores through several mergers and acquisitions, excluding our acquisition of Family Dollar. Historically, our acquisition strategy has been to target companies that have a similar single price point concept that have shown success in operations or companies that provide a strategic advantage. We evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they become available. On July 6, 2015, we completed our acquisition of Family Dollar which allowed us to create a diversified company with complementary business models.
From time to time, we also acquire the rights to store leases through bankruptcy or other proceedings. We will continue to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise depending upon several factors including their fit within our location and selling square footage size parameters.
Merchandising and Distribution. Expanding our customer base is important to our growth plans. We plan to continue to stock our stores with a compelling mix of ever-changing merchandise that our customers have come to appreciate. Consumable merchandise typically leads to more frequent return trips to our stores resulting in increased sales. The presentation and display of merchandise in our stores are critical to communicating value to our customers and creating a more exciting shopping experience. We believe our approach to visual merchandising results in higher sales volume and an environment that encourages impulse purchases.
A strong and efficient distribution network is critical to our ability to grow and to maintain a low-cost operating structure. In 2018, we began construction on our Morrow County, Ohio distribution center, which will be 1.2 million square feet and automated, and will initially serve stores in our Dollar Tree segment. We expect this facility to be operational in the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, in 2018 we completed our Warrensburg, Missouri distribution center, which is 1.2 million square feet, automated and currently serves stores in our Dollar Tree segment. In 2016, we completed our Cherokee County, South Carolina distribution center, which is 1.5 million square feet, automated and currently serves stores in our Dollar Tree segment. In addition, we expanded our Dollar Tree Stockton, California distribution center to 0.9 million square feet. In fiscal 2019, we announced plans to construct a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center in Rosenberg, Texas which is expected to provide service directly to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores and be operational by the summer of 2020.
Our St. George, Utah distribution center services both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores. In addition, we ship select product from our Dollar Tree distribution centers to our Family Dollar distribution centers and in fiscal 2019, we expect to ship select product from our Dollar Tree distribution centers directly to certain of our Family Dollar stores. We believe our distribution center network is currently capable of supporting approximately $28.0 billion in annual sales in the United States. New distribution sites are strategically located to reduce stem miles, maintain flexibility and improve efficiency in our store service areas. We also are a party to an agreement which provides distribution services from two facilities in Canada.
Our Dollar Tree stores receive approximately 90% of their inventory from our distribution centers via contract carriers and our Family Dollar stores receive approximately 75% of their inventory from our distribution centers. The remaining store inventory, primarily perishable consumable items and other vendor-maintained display items, are delivered directly to our stores from vendors. Our Family Dollar stores receive approximately 13% of their merchandise from McLane Company, Inc. For more information on our distribution center network, see “Item 2. Properties” beginning on page 20 of this Form 10-K.

Competition
Our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. We operate in the discount retail sector, which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation and customer service. Our competitors include single-price dollar stores, multi-price dollar stores, mass merchandisers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, independently-operated discount stores and a wide variety of other retailers. In addition, several competitors have sections within their stores devoted to “one dollar” price point merchandise, which further increases competition. We believe we differentiate ourselves from other retailers by providing high-value, high-quality, low-cost merchandise in attractively-designed stores that are conveniently located. Our sales and profits could be reduced by increases in competition. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our retail sector.
Trademarks
We are the owners of several federal service mark registrations including “Dollar Tree,” the “Dollar Tree” logo, and the Dollar Tree logo with a “1.” In addition, we own a registration for “Dollar Bill$.” We also acquired the rights to use trade names previously owned by Everything’s A Dollar, a former competitor in the $1.00 price point industry. Several trade names were included in the purchase, including the mark “Everything’s $1.00.” We also own the logo mark for “Everything’s $1.” With the acquisition of Dollar Giant, we became the owner of several trademarks in Canada. With the acquisition of Family Dollar, we became the owners of the trademarks “Family Dollar,” “Family Dollar Stores” and other names and designs of certain merchandise sold in Family Dollar stores. We have federal trademark registrations for a number and variety of private labels that we use to market many of our product lines. Our trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that the trademark registrations are properly maintained and renewed, they have a perpetual duration.
Employees
We employed approximately 57,200 full-time and 124,900 part-time associates on February 2, 2019. Part-time associates work an average of less than 30 hours per week. The number of part-time associates fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. We consider our relationship with our associates to be good, and we have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.
