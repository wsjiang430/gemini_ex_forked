ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a leading technology and analytics company focused on providing online financial services. In 2018, we extended approximately $2.5 billion in credit or financing to borrowers. As of December 31, 2018, we offered or arranged loans or draws on lines of credit to consumers in 32 states in the United States and in the United Kingdom and Brazil. We also offered financing to small businesses in all 50 states and Washington D.C. in the United States. We use our proprietary technology, analytics and customer service capabilities to quickly evaluate, underwrite and fund loans or provide financing, allowing us to offer consumers and small businesses credit or financing when and how they want it. Our customers include the large and growing number of consumers who and small businesses which have bank accounts but use alternative financial services because of their limited access to more traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. We were an early entrant into online lending, launching our online business in 2004, and through December 31, 2018, we have completed over 47.5 million customer transactions and collected approximately 26 terabytes of currently accessible consumer behavior data, allowing us to better analyze and underwrite our specific customer base. We have significantly diversified our business over the past several years having expanded the markets we serve and the financing products we offer. These financing products include short-term loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and receivables purchase agreements (“RPAs”).
We believe our customers highly value our products and services as an important component of their personal or business finances because our products are convenient, quick and often less expensive than other available alternatives. We attribute the success of our business to our advanced and innovative technology systems, the proprietary analytical models we use to predict the performance of loans and finance receivables, our sophisticated customer acquisition programs, our dedication to customer service and our talented employees. 
 We have developed proprietary underwriting systems based on data we have collected over our more than 14 years of experience. These systems employ advanced risk analytics to decide whether to approve financing transactions, to structure the amount and terms of the financings we offer pursuant to jurisdiction-specific regulations and to provide customers with their funds quickly and efficiently. Our systems closely monitor collection and portfolio performance data that we use to continually refine the analytical models and statistical measures used in making our credit, purchase, marketing and collection decisions. 
 Our flexible and scalable technology platforms allow us to process and complete customers’ transactions quickly and efficiently. In 2018, we processed approximately 4.3 million transactions, and we continue to grow our loan and finance receivables portfolio and increase the number of customers we serve through desktop, tablet and mobile platforms. Our highly customizable technology platforms allow us to efficiently develop and deploy new products to adapt to evolving regulatory requirements and consumer preference, and to enter new markets quickly. In 2012, we launched a new product in the United States designed to serve near-prime customers. In April 2014, we launched On Stride Financial, an installment loan product, in the United Kingdom. In June 2014, we launched our business in Brazil, where we arrange financing for borrowers through a third-party lender. In addition, in July 2014, we introduced a new line of credit product in the United States to serve the needs of small businesses. In June 2015, we further expanded our product offering by acquiring certain assets of a company that provides financing and installment loans to small businesses by offering RPAs (see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). These new products have allowed us to further diversify our product offerings, customer base and geographic scope. In 2018, we derived 85.0% of our total revenue from the United States and 15.0% of our total revenue internationally, with 84.4% of international revenue (representing 12.7% of our total revenue) generated in the United Kingdom. 
 We have been able to consistently acquire new customers and successfully generate repeat business from returning customers when they need financing. We believe our customers are loyal to us because they are satisfied with our products and services. We acquire new customers from a variety of sources, including visits to our own websites, mobile sites or applications, and through direct marketing, affiliate marketing, lead providers and relationships with other lenders. We believe that the online convenience of our products and our 24/7 availability to accept applications with quick approval decisions are important to our customers.
 Once a potential customer submits an application, we quickly provide a credit or purchase decision. If a loan or financing is approved, we or our lending partner typically fund the loan or financing the next business day or, in some cases, the same day. During the entire process, from application through payment, we provide access to our well-trained customer service team. All of our operations, from customer acquisition through collections, are structured to build customer satisfaction and loyalty, in the event that a customer has a need for our products in the future. We have developed a series of sophisticated proprietary scoring models to support our various products. We believe that these models are an integral component of our operations and allow us to complete a high volume of customer transactions while actively managing risk and the related credit quality of our loan and finance receivable portfolios. We believe our successful application of these technology innovations differentiates our capabilities relative to competitive platforms as evidenced by our history of strong growth and stable credit quality.

Products and Services 
 Our online financing products and services provide customers with a deposit of funds to their bank account in exchange for a commitment to repay the amount deposited plus fees, interest and/or revenue on the receivables purchased. We originate, arrange, guarantee or purchase short-term consumer loans, line of credit accounts, installment loans and RPAs. We also offer an analytics-as-a-service solution for businesses. We have one reportable segment that includes all of our online financial services. 
 Short-term consumer loans. Short-term consumer loans are unsecured loans written by us or by a third-party lender through our credit services organization and credit access business programs, which we refer to as our CSO programs, that we arrange and guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, we offered or arranged short-term consumer loans in 17 states in the United States and the United Kingdom. Short-term consumer loans generally have terms of seven to 90 days, with proceeds typically deposited promptly in the customer’s bank account in exchange for a pre-authorized debit from their account or debit card. Due to the credit risk and high transaction costs of serving our customer segment, the interest and/or fees we charge are generally considered to be higher than the interest or fees charged to consumers with superior credit histories by banks and similar lenders who are typically unwilling to make unsecured loans to non-prime credit consumers. Our short-term consumer loans contributed approximately 19.7% of our total revenue in 2018, 23.4% in 2017, and 26.3% in 2016. 
 Line of credit accounts. We offer new consumer line of credit accounts in seven states (and continue to service existing line of credit accounts in one additional state) in the United States and business line of credit accounts in 36 states in the United States, which allow customers to draw on their unsecured line of credit in increments of their choosing up to their credit limit. Customers may pay off their account balance in full at any time or make required minimum payments in accordance with their terms of the line of credit account. As long as the customer’s account is in good standing and has credit available, customers may continue to borrow on their line of credit. Our line of credit accounts contributed approximately 32.6% of our total revenue in 2018, 31.1% in 2017, and 29.6% in 2016. 
 Installment loans. Installment loans are longer-term loans that generally require the outstanding principal balance to be paid down in multiple installments. We offer, or arrange through our CSO programs, as defined below, multi-payment unsecured consumer installment loan products in 17 states in the United States and small business installment loans in 18 states. We also offer or arrange multi-payment unsecured consumer installment loan products in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Terms for our installment loan products range between two and 60 months. These loans generally have higher principal amounts than short-term loans. The loan may be repaid early at any time with no prepayment charges. Our installment loans contributed approximately 46.4% of our total revenue in 2018, 43.6% in 2017, and 41.4% in 2016. 
 We have been investing and will continue to invest in the growth of our near-prime installment lending portfolio.
 Receivables purchase agreements. Under RPAs, small businesses receive funds in exchange for a portion of the business’s future receivables at an agreed upon discount. In contrast, lending is a commitment to repay principal and interest and/or fees. A small business customer who enters into an RPA commits to delivering a percentage of its receivables through ACH or wire debits or by splitting credit card receipts until all purchased receivables are delivered. We offer RPAs in all 50 states and in Washington D.C. in the United States. RPAs contributed approximately 1.2% of our total revenue in 2018, 1.8% in 2017, and 2.5% in 2016.
 CSO programs. Through our CSO programs, we provide services related to third-party lenders’ short-term and installment loan products by acting as a credit services organization or credit access business on behalf of consumers in accordance with applicable state laws. Services offered under our CSO programs include credit-related services such as arranging loans with independent third-party lenders and assisting in the preparation of loan applications and loan documents (“CSO loans”). When a consumer executes an agreement with us under our CSO programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the consumer, to provide certain services, one of which is to guarantee the consumer’s obligation to repay the loan received by the consumer from the third-party lender if the consumer fails to do so. For CSO loans, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the consumer’s application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We, in turn, are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loan. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific short-term loans, which generally have terms of less than 90 days, and specific installment loans, which have terms of four to 12 months, if they go into default. 
 As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding amount of active short-term consumer loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $25.4 million, $28.9 million and $26.1 million, respectively, which were guaranteed by us. The outstanding amount of active installment loans originated by third-party lenders under the CSO programs was $4.3 million, $5.2 million and $6.1 million as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were guaranteed by us.
 Bank program. In March 2016, we launched a program with a state-chartered bank where we provide technology, loan servicing and marketing services to the bank (the “Bank Program”). Our bank partner offered unsecured consumer installment loans with an APR at or below 36%. We also had the ability to purchase loans originated through this program. In May 2018, as a result of a change in the law in Ohio, our bank partner suspended lending and we suspended purchasing loans through this program. We plan to continue and

grow this program in the future by adding new partners and expanding into additional states. Revenue generated from this program for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 1.7%, 2.1% and 0.6% of our total revenue, respectively.
 Decision Management Platform-as-a-Service (“dmPaaS”) and Analytics-as-a-Service (“AaaS”). Launched under our Enova Decisions brand in 2016, we help businesses make better decisions faster by providing our decision management platform and analytics expertise as a service. Our solutions are designed to automate or augment customer decisions including, but not limited to, credit risk, fraud risk, identity verification, customer profitability, payments, and collection. Services offered under our dmPaaS include machine learning model deployment, business rules management, data source connectivity, decision flow authoring, decision simulation, experiments, and real-time decision flow execution via API. Through our AaaS offerings, we provide tailored predictive/prescriptive analytic model development, explainable machine learning, and mathematical optimization. Industries served include financial services, communications, telecommunications, healthcare, and higher education in North America and Asia. Although still less than 1% of total revenue, we plan to continue to grow this program through increasing the size of our sales team, adding new partners, and continued enhancement of our technology.
 Our Markets 
 We currently provide our services in the following countries:

Key Financial and Operating Metrics 
 We have achieved significant growth since we began our online business as we have expanded both our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve. We measure our business using several financial and operating metrics. Our key metrics include domestic and international combined loans and finance receivables outstanding, in addition to other measures described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
 This growth in product offerings and geographic markets has resulted in significant revenue diversification, as set forth below: 
 
Additional financial information regarding our operating segment and each of the geographic areas in which we do business is provided in Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Our Industry 
 The internet has transformed how consumers and small businesses shop for and acquire products and services. According to a study by the United Nations, 51.2% of the world’s population had access to the internet in 2018, a 7% increase from 2015. International Data Corporation reported that global internet usage is expected to increase at a pace of 2% annually through 2020. Accompanying the rise in internet usage is the continued disruption of storefront retail by e-commerce companies like Amazon, as consumers flock to purchase goods and interact with businesses online. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales as a percent of total quarterly retail sales in the United States more than doubled from the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of 2018, reaching 9.1%. In addition, a number of traditional financial services, such as banking, bill payment and investing, have become widely available online. A March 2018 report by the Consumer and Community Development Research Section of the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs found that approximately 50% of bank customers in a U.S. sample have used mobile banking as a means of accessing banking services. This level of use highlights the extent to which consumers now accept the internet for conducting their financial transactions and are willing to entrust their financial information to online companies. We believe the increased acceptance of online financial services has led to an increased demand for online lending and financing, the benefits of which include customer privacy, easy access, security, 24/7 availability to apply for a loan or financing, speed of funding and transparency of fees and interest. 
 We use the internet to serve the large and growing number of underbanked consumers and small businesses that have bank accounts but use alternative financial services because of their limited access to more traditional credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. Demand from consumers has been fueled by several demographic and socioeconomic trends, including an overall increase in the population and stagnant to declining growth in the household income for working-class individuals. The necessity for alternative financial services was highlighted by a May 2018 report from the Federal Reserve, which found that 41% of respondents could not cover an emergency expense of $400, or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money. The report also found a sizeable portion of the population (23%) is unbanked or underbanked, with half of unbanked consumers turning to alternative financial services options in the prior year. Approximately 32% of respondents who applied for credit were denied credit or were offered less credit than they desired, and 4% of respondents desired credit but did not apply for fear of denial.
 Small businesses are also suffering from lack of access to credit from traditional lenders. Among a sample of small businesses surveyed for the National Small Business Association’s 2017 Year-End Economic Report, 20% reported that lack of available capital is one of the three most significant challenges to the future growth and survival of their business. Similarly, according to a 2017 study by the Federal Reserve Banks, only 34% of nonemployer firms that were approved for financing received the full amount requested. Online lending and funding options are emerging as a solution for small businesses that are seeking capital. According to a 2017 report from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, online alternative finance platforms in the United States facilitated more than $6.9 billion of loans to small and medium enterprises in 2015, up 145% from the previous year. The Federal Reserve found that 24% of small businesses surveyed applied for credit from online lenders. Aside from the need for capital, businesses seek out online lenders for their often faster, easier application process. In the Federal Reserve study, approved applicants cited the long wait for a credit decision and the difficult application process as top reasons for their dissatisfaction with banks, whereas online lenders performed the best in these areas. 
 We believe that consumers and small businesses seek online lending services for numerous reasons, including because they often: 
  
• | prefer the simplicity, transparency and convenience of these services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require access to financial services outside of normal financial services storefront hours;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have an immediate need for cash for financial challenges and unexpected expenses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have been unable to access certain traditional lending or other credit services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | seek an alternative to the high cost of bank overdraft fees, credit card and other late payment fees and utility late payment fees or disconnect and reconnection fees; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | wish to avoid potential negative credit consequences of missed payments with traditional creditors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With increasing competition across industries, tightening regulations and higher expectations from consumers, businesses are seeking solutions for faster, more accurate decision making. In 2016, we launched a product that uses our proprietary technology and analytics capabilities to offer businesses a solution for real-time decisioning at scale. The analytics-as-a-service market was valued at more than $7 billion, and, according to a report by Orbis Research, the market is expected to experience a CAGR of 30% between 2017 and 2022, reaching a value of $49 billion by the end of 2022.

Our Customers
 Our subprime consumer customer base is comprised largely of individuals living in households that earn an average annual income of $41,000 in the United States and £25,000 in the United Kingdom, and our U.S. near-prime customers earn an average annual income of $58,000. Based on our analysis of industry data, we believe our addressable markets are approximately 68 million and 7 million individuals in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. The short-term lending market is sizable in the United States, the United Kingdom and Brazil. We estimate there is a $69 billion consumer lending opportunity market in the United States and a $9 billion lending market in the United Kingdom. In Brazil, we estimate there to be an $80 billion consumer loans market. Small business lending is also an attractive market opportunity, with a total U.S. small business loan market of $82 billion. Tighter banking regulations forced banks to vacate the market for loans under $1 million. Loans under $100 thousand are the fastest growing loan segment and over 50% of all small business loan growth. Our small business customers who enter into RPAs average approximately $1.3 million in annual sales and 12 years of operating history, while those who obtain a line of credit account average approximately $495 thousand in annual sales and 6 years of operating history.
Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe that the following competitive strengths position us well for continued growth: 
  
• | Significant operating history and first mover advantage. As an early entrant in the online lending sector, we have accumulated approximately 26 terabytes of currently accessible consumer behavior data from more than 47 million transactions in our more than 14 years of experience. This database allows us to market to a customer base with an established borrowing history as well as to better evaluate and underwrite new customers, leading to better loan performance. In order to develop a comparable database, we believe that competitors would need to incur high marketing and customer acquisition costs, overcome customer brand loyalties and have sufficient capital to withstand higher early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. Additionally, we are licensed in all jurisdictions that require licensing and believe that it would be difficult and time-consuming for a new entrant to obtain such licenses. We have also created strong brand recognition over our more than 14 years of operating history and we continue to invest in our brands, such as CashNetUSA, NetCredit, QuickQuid, On Stride Financial, Headway Capital, The Business Backer, Simplic and Enova Decisions, to further increase our visibility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Proprietary analytics, data and underwriting. We have developed a fully integrated decision engine that evaluates and rapidly makes credit and other determinations throughout the customer relationship, including automated decisions regarding marketing, underwriting, customer contact and collections. Our decision engine currently handles more than 100 algorithms and over 1,000 variables. These algorithms are constantly monitored, validated, updated and optimized to continuously improve our operations. Our proprietary models are built on over 14 years of lending history, using advanced statistical methods that take into account our experience with the millions of transactions we have processed during that time and the use of data from numerous third-party sources. Since we designed our system specifically for our specialized products, we believe our system provides more predictive assessments of future loan behavior than traditional credit assessments, such as the Fair Isaac Corporation score (“FICO score”), and therefore, results in better evaluation of our customer base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable and flexible technology platforms. Our proprietary technology platforms are designed to be powerful enough to handle the large volume of data required to evaluate customer applications and flexible enough to capitalize on changing customer preferences, market trends and regulatory requirements. These platforms have enabled us to achieve significant growth over more than 14 years as we have expanded both our product offerings and the geographic markets we serve. We began offering installment loans in the United States and United Kingdom in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and added line of credit products in the United States in 2010. We have experienced significant growth in these products, with revenue contribution from installment and line of credit products increasing from 11.7% of total revenue in 2010 to 80.2% of total revenue in 2018. Similarly, total revenue contribution from our international operations, primarily in the United Kingdom, grew from $40.5 million, or 15.9% of total revenue in 2009, to $335.1 million, or 41.4% of total revenue in 2014. Due to regulatory changes in the United Kingdom, international revenue decreased during 2015 and 2016 to $142.4 million and $122.6 million, respectively. However, international revenue increased to $134.2 million in 2017 and to $167.6 million, or 15.0% of total revenue, in 2018. Due to the scalability of our platform, we were able to achieve this growth without significant investment in additional infrastructure, and over the past three years, capital expenditures have averaged only 1.8% of revenue per year. We expect our advanced technology and underwriting platform to help continue to drive significant growth in our business.

• | Focus on customer experience. We believe that non-prime credit consumers and small businesses are not adequately served by traditional lenders. To better serve these consumers and small businesses, we use customer-focused business practices, including extended-hours availability of our customer service team by phone, email, fax and web chat. We continuously work to improve customer satisfaction by evaluating information from website analytics, customer surveys, call center feedback and focus groups. Our call center teams receive training on a regular basis and are monitored by quality assurance managers. We believe customers who wish to access credit or financing again often return to us because of our dedication to customer service, the transparency of our fees and interest charges and our adherence to trade association “best practices.”

• | Diligent regulatory compliance. We conduct our business in a highly regulated industry. We are focused on regulatory compliance and have devoted significant resources to comply with laws that apply to us, while we believe many of our online competitors have traditionally not done so. We tailor our lending products and services to comply with the specific requirements of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to interest, fees, loan durations and renewals or extensions, loan amounts, disclosures and underwriting requirements. Our compliance experience and proprietary technology platform allow us to launch new products and to enter new geographic regions with a focus on compliance with applicable laws and customer protection. We are members of industry trade groups, including the Online Lenders Alliance in the United States and the Consumer Finance Association in the United Kingdom, which have promulgated “best practices” for our industry that we have adopted. The flexibility of our online platform enables us to rapidly adapt our products as necessary to comply with changes in regulation, without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining of store-based employees and other expenses faced by our storefront competitors.

• | Proven history of growth and profitability. Over the last eight years, we grew our net loan and finance receivables, which are the gross outstanding balances for our loan and finance receivables carried on the consolidated balance sheets net of the allowance for estimated losses, at a compound annual growth rate of 26.8%, from $163.0 million as of December 31, 2011 to $859.9 million as of December 31, 2018. Over the same period, our revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate of 12.8%, from $480.3 million in 2011 to $1,114.1 million in 2018, while Adjusted EBITDA grew at a compound annual growth rate of 13.3%, from $87.7 million to $210.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin has remained steady, increasing slightly from 18.3% of revenue in 2011 to 18.9% of revenue in 2018. See note (a) in “Selected Financial Data—Part II, Item 6” of this report for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (which is Adjusted EBITDA margin).

• | Talented, highly educated employees. We believe we have one of the most skilled and talented teams of professionals in the industry. Our employees have exceptional educational backgrounds, with numerous post-graduate and undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. We hire and develop top talent from graduate and undergraduate programs at institutions such as Carnegie Mellon University, Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. The extensive education of our team is complemented by the experience our leadership team obtained at leading financial services companies and technology firms such as optionsXpress, HSBC, Discover Financial Services, First American Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Groupon.

Our Growth Strategy 
  
• | Increase penetration in existing markets through direct marketing. We believe that we have reached only a small number of the potential customers for our products and services in the markets in which we currently operate. We continue to focus on our direct customer acquisition channels, with direct marketing (traditional and digital) generating approximately 54% of our new consumer transactions in 2018, as compared to 32% in 2009. We believe these channels allow us to reach a larger customer base at a lower acquisition cost than the traditional online lead purchasing model. Additionally, as our smaller and less sophisticated competitors, both online and storefront, struggle to adapt to both regulatory developments and evolving customer preference, we believe we have the opportunity to gain significant market share.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand globally to reach new markets. We are building on our global reach by entering new markets. In June 2014, we launched our business in Brazil, where we arrange loans for borrowers through a third party lender. We also operated a pilot program in China in 2014 and 2015 where we arranged loans for borrowers through a third party lender but in 2016 decided to address the Chinese market as an analytics provider going forward. We believe that these countries have significant populations of underserved consumers. When pursuing geographic expansion, factors we consider include, among others, whether there is (i) widespread internet usage, (ii) an established and interconnected banking system and (iii) government policy that promotes the extension of credit. Our business in Brazil and our previous pilot in China, as well as our launches into the United Kingdom in 2007 and Australia and Canada in 2009, demonstrate that we can quickly and efficiently enter and explore new markets. Our revenue from international operations has increased from $1.6 million in 2007, or 0.9% of our total revenue, to $167.6 million, or 15.0% of our total revenue in 2018.

• | Introduce new products and services. We plan to attract new categories of consumers and small businesses not served by traditional lenders through the introduction of new products and services. We have introduced new products to expand our businesses from solely single-payment consumer loans to installment loans, line of credit accounts and small business loans and financing, using our analytics expertise and our flexible and scalable technology platform. In 2012, we launched NetCredit, a longer duration installment loan product for near-prime consumers in the United States. In April 2014, we launched On Stride Financial, an installment loan product, in the United Kingdom. In July 2014, we launched Headway Capital, a line of credit product in the United States that serves the needs of small businesses. In June 2015, we completed the purchase of certain assets of a company operating as The Business Backer, which allows us to provide short-term financing to small businesses throughout the United States through RPAs, and in 2017, The Business Backer began offering an installment loan product. In 2016, we launched a program with a state-chartered bank where we provide technology, loan servicing and marketing services to the bank

on unsecured installment loans that it makes with consumers that have an APR at or below 36%. In May 2018, as a result of a change in the law in Ohio, our bank partner suspended lending and we suspended purchasing loans through this program. We plan to continue and grow this program in the future by adding new partners and expanding into additional states. Also in 2016, we launched Enova Decisions, our analytics-as-a-service product that uses our proprietary technology and analytics capabilities to offer businesses a solution for real-time decisioning at scale. We intend to continue to evaluate and offer new products and services that complement our online specialty financial services in order to meet the growing needs of our consumers and small businesses.

Online Financing Process 
 Our consumer and small business financing transactions are conducted almost exclusively online. When a customer is approved for a new loan or RPA, nearly all customers choose to have funds promptly deposited in their bank account and choose to use a pre-authorized debit for repayment from their bank account or debit card. Where permitted by law and approved by us, a customer may choose to renew a short-term consumer loan before payment becomes due by agreeing to pay an additional finance charge. If a loan is renewed or refinanced, the renewal or refinanced loan is considered a new loan. 
 We have created a quick and simple process for customers to apply for an online loan or RPA, as shown below: 

Technology Platform 
 Our proprietary technology platforms are built for scalability and flexibility and are based on proven open source software. The technology platforms were designed to be powerful enough to handle the large volumes of data required to evaluate consumer and small business applications and flexible enough to capitalize on changing customer preferences, market trends and regulatory changes. The scalability and flexibility of our technology platforms allow us to enter new markets and launch new products quickly, typically within three to six months from conception to launch. 
 We continually employ technological innovations to improve our technology platforms, which perform a variety of integrated and core functions, including: 
  
• | Front-end system, which includes external websites, landing pages and mobile sites and applications that customers use when applying for loans or financing and managing their accounts;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Back-end and customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, which maintain customer-level data and are used by our call center employees to provide real-time information for all inquiries. Our back-end system and CRM systems include, among other things, our contact management system, operational and marketing management system, automated phone system, Interactive Voice Response and call center performance management system;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decision engine, which rapidly evaluates and makes credit and financing decisions throughout the customer relationship; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial system, which manages the external interface for funds transfers and provides daily accounting, reconciliation and reporting functions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key elements of our technology platforms include: 
  
• | Scalable Information Technology infrastructure. Our Information Technology infrastructure allows us to meet customer demand and accommodate business growth. Our services rely on accessing, evaluating and creating large volumes of data including, for example, information collected from approximately 89 million credit reports during 2018. This rich dataset has grown significantly over our more than 14-year history and will continue to grow as our business expands. We believe that our scalable IT infrastructure enables us to meet substantial growth demands.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible software and integration systems. Our software system is designed to allow us to enter new markets and launch new products rapidly, modify our business operations quickly and account for complex regulatory requirements imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have developed a proprietary software solution that allows us to innovate quickly and to improve the customer experience. Our integration system allows us to easily interface with banks and other strategic partners in order to deliver the best financial products and services possible. Our software and integration systems and their flexibility allow us much more control over the continually evolving aspects of our business.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid development processes. Our software development life cycle is rapid and iterative to increase the efficiency of our platform. We are able to implement software updates while maintaining our system stability.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Security. We collect and store personally identifiable customer information, including names, addresses, social security numbers and bank account information. We have safeguards designed to protect this information. We also created controls to limit employee access to that information and to monitor that access. Our safeguards and controls have been independently verified through regular and recurring audits and assessments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Redundant disaster recovery. Certain key parts of our technology platform, such as our phone system for handling U.S. and U.K. customer service on consumer loans, are distributed across two different locations. In addition, critical components of our platform are redundant. This provides redundancy, fault tolerance and disaster recovery functionality in case of a catastrophic outage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proprietary Data and Analytics 
 Decision Engine 
 We have developed a fully integrated decision engine that evaluates and rapidly makes credit and other determinations throughout the customer relationship, including automated decisions regarding marketing, underwriting, customer contact and collections. Our decision engine currently handles more than 100 algorithms and over 1,000 variables. The algorithms in use are constantly monitored, validated, updated and optimized to continuously improve our operations. In order to support the daily running and ongoing improvement of our decision engine, we have assembled a highly skilled team of over 60 data and analytics professionals as of December 31, 2018. 
Proprietary Data, Models and Underwriting 
 Our proprietary models are built on more than 14 years of history, using advanced statistical methods that take into account our experience with the millions of transactions we have processed during that time and the use of data from numerous third-party sources. We continually update our underwriting models to manage risk of defaults and to structure loan and financing terms. Our system completes these assessments within seconds of receiving the customer’s data. 
 Our underwriting system is able to assess risks associated with each customer individually based on specific customer information and historical trends in our portfolio. We use a combination of numerous factors when evaluating a potential customer, which can include a consumer’s income, rent or mortgage payment amount, employment history, external credit reporting agency scores, amount and status of outstanding debt and other recurring expenditures, fraud reports, repayment history, charge-off history and the length of time the customer has lived at his or her current address. While the relative weight or importance of the specific variables that we consider when underwriting a loan changes from product to product, generally, the key factors that we consider for loans include monthly gross income, disposable income, length of employment, duration of residency, credit report history and prior loan performance history if the applicant is a returning customer. Similar factors are considered for small business applicants and also include length of time in business, online business reviews, and sales volumes. Our customer base for consumer loans is predominantly in the low to fair range of FICO scores, with scores generally between 500 and 680 for most of our loan products. We generally do not take into account a potential customer’s FICO score when deciding whether to make a loan. A Vantage score is one of the factors in our credit models for our near-prime installment product in the United States. Since we designed our system specifically for our specialized products, we believe our system provides more predictive assessments of future payment behavior and results in better evaluation of our customer base when compared to traditional credit assessments, such as a FICO score.

Fraud Prevention 
 Our robust fraud prevention system is built from in-depth analysis of previous fraud incidences and information from third party data sources. To ensure sustainable growth, our fraud prevention team has built rigorous systems and processes to detect fraud trends, identify fraudulent applications and learn from past fraudulent cases. 
 Working together with multiple vendors, our systems first determine whether customer information submitted matches other indicators regarding the application and that the applicant can authorize transactions for the submitted bank account. To prevent more organized and systematic fraud, we have developed predictive models that incorporate signals from various sources that we have found to be useful in identifying fraud. These models utilize advanced data mining algorithms and recent technologies to effectively identify fraudulent applications with a very low false positive rate. In addition, we have built strong loan processing teams that handle suspicious activities efficiently while minimizing friction in customer experience. Our fraud prevention system incorporates algorithms to differentiate customers in an effort to identify suspected fraudulent activity and to reduce our risks of loss from fraud.
 We continuously develop and implement ongoing improvements to these systems and, while no system can completely protect against losses from fraud, we believe our systems provide protection against significant fraud losses. 
 Marketing 
 We use a multi-channel approach to marketing our online loans and financing products, with both broad-reach and highly-targeted channels, including television, digital, direct mail, telemarketing and partner marketing (which includes lead providers, independent brokers and marketing affiliates). The goal of our marketing is to promote our brands and products in the online lending marketplace and to directly acquire new customers at low cost. Our marketing has successfully built strong awareness of and preference for our brands, as our products have achieved market leadership through the following: 

• | Traditional advertising. We use television, direct mail, radio and outdoor advertisements, supported by technology infrastructure and key vendors, to drive and optimize website traffic and loan volume. We believe our investments through these channels have helped create strong brand awareness and preference in the customer segments and markets we serve.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital acquisition. Our online marketing efforts include pay-per-click, keyword advertising, search engine optimization, marketing affiliate partnerships, social media programs and mobile advertising integrated with our operating systems and technology from vendors that allow us to optimize customer acquisition tactics within the daily operations cycle.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Partner marketing. We purchase qualified leads for prospective new customers from a number of online lead providers and independent brokers and through marketing affiliate partnerships. We believe that our rapid decision making on lead purchases, strong customer conversion rate and significant scale in each of our markets make us a preferred partner for lead providers, brokers and affiliates while at the same time our technology and analytics help us determine the right price for the right leads.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | User experience and conversion. We measure and monitor website visitor usage metrics and regularly test website design strategies to improve customer experience and conversion rates.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our brand, technology and analytics-powered approach to marketing has enabled us to increase the percentage of consumer loans sourced through direct marketing (where we have more visibility and control than in the lead purchase or affiliate channels) from approximately 32% in 2009 to 54% in 2018, and we believe we have also improved customer brand loyalty during the same period. 
 Customer Service 
 We believe that our in-house call center and our emphasis on superior customer service are significant contributors to our growth. To best serve our consumers and small businesses, we use customer-oriented business practices, such as offering extended-hours customer service. We continuously work to improve our customers’ experience and satisfaction by evaluating information from website analytics, customer satisfaction surveys, call center feedback, call monitoring and focus groups. Our call center teams receive training on a regular basis, are monitored by quality assurance managers and adhere to rigorous internal service-level agreements. We do not outsource our call center operations, except in Brazil. We have two call center facilities to support our U.S. and U.K. operations, one in our corporate offices in Chicago and another in Gurnee, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 600 employees in our call centers supporting our customers. 
Collections 
 We operate centralized collection teams within our two call centers to coordinate a consistent approach. We have implemented loan and financing collection policies and practices designed to optimize regulatory compliant loan and financing repayment, while also providing excellent customer service. Our collections employees are trained to help the customer understand available payment 
 9


alternatives and make arrangements to repay the loan or financing. We use a variety of collection strategies to satisfy a delinquent loan, such as settlements and payment plans, or to adjust the delivery of finance receivables. 
 Call center employees contact customers following the first missed payment and periodically thereafter. Our primary methods of contacting past due customers are through phone calls, letters and emails. At times, we sell loans that we are unable to collect to debt collection companies or place the debt for collection with debt collection companies. 
 Competition 
 We have many competitors. Our principal competitors are consumer loan and finance companies, CSOs, online lenders, credit card companies, auto title lenders, pawnshops and other financial institutions that offer similar financial products and services, including loans on an unsecured as well as a secured basis. We believe that there is also indirect competition to some of our products, including bank overdraft facilities and banks’ and retailers’ insufficient funds policies, many of which may be more expensive alternative approaches for consumers and small businesses to cover their bills and expenses than the consumer and small business loan and financing products we offer. Some of our U.S. competitors operate using other business models, including a “tribal model” where the lender follows the laws of a Native American tribe regardless of the state in which the customer resides. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors in the consumer and small business loan and financing industry consist of the ability to provide sufficient loan or financing size to meet customers’ financing requests, speed of funding, customer privacy, ease of access, transparency of fees and interest and customer service. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage as an early mover in many of the markets that we serve. New entrants face obstacles typical to launching new lending operations, such as successfully implementing underwriting and fraud prevention processes, incurring high marketing and customer acquisition costs, overcoming customer brand loyalty and having or obtaining sufficient capital to withstand early losses associated with unseasoned loan portfolios. In addition, there are substantial regulatory and compliance costs, including the need for expertise to customize products and obtain licenses to lend in various states in the United States and in international jurisdictions. Our proprietary technology, analytics expertise, scale, international reach, brand recognition and regulatory compliance would be difficult for a new competitor to duplicate. 
 Because numerous competitors offer consumer and small business loan and financing products, and many of our competitors are privately held, it is difficult for us to determine our exact competitive position in the market. However, we believe our principal online competitors in the United States include Avant, Curo, Elevate, and LendUp. Storefront consumer loan lenders that offer loans online or in storefronts are also a source of competition in some of the markets where we offer consumer loans, including Ace Cash Express, Check Into Cash, Check ‘n Go and One Main Financial. For online small business financing, we believe our main competitors are CAN Capital, OnDeck and Kabbage. In the United Kingdom, we believe that our principal online competitors include 118 118 Money, Amigo, Avant, Elevate, Lending Stream, Mr. Lender, PaydayUK, and Satsuma. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Protecting our rights to our intellectual property is critical, as it enhances our ability to offer distinctive services and products to our customers, which differentiates us from our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark laws and trade secret protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our proprietary analytics, predictive underwriting models, tradenames and marks and software systems. We have several registered trademarks, including CashNetUSA, QuickQuid and our “e” logo. These trademarks have varying expiration dates, and we believe they are materially important to us and we anticipate maintaining them and renewing them. 
Seasonality 
 Demand for our consumer loan products and services in the United States has historically been highest in the third and fourth quarters of each year, corresponding to the holiday season, and lowest in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers’ receipt of income tax refunds. Typically, our cost of revenue for our consumer loan products, which represents our loan loss provision, is lowest as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter of each year, corresponding to our customers’ receipt of income tax refunds, and increases as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of each year. Consequently, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our domestic operating results and cash needs.

 Market and Industry Data 
 The market and industry data contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including trends in our markets and our position within such markets, are based on a variety of sources, including our good faith estimates, which are derived from our review of internal surveys, information obtained from customers and publicly available information, as well as from independent industry publications, reports by market research firms and other published independent sources. Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently verified the information. None of the independent industry publications used in this report were prepared on our behalf. 
REGULATION 
 Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, local and international statutes, ordinances and regulations.
 U.S. Federal Regulation 
 Consumer Lending Laws. Our consumer loan business is subject to the federal Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), and its underlying regulations, known as Regulation Z, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”). These laws require us to provide certain disclosures to prospective borrowers and protect against unfair credit practices. The principal disclosures required under TILA are intended to promote the informed use of consumer credit. Under TILA, when acting as a lender, we are required to disclose certain material terms related to a credit transaction, including, but not limited to, the annual percentage rate, finance charge, amount financed, total of payments, the number and amount of payments and payment due dates to repay the indebtedness. The FCRA regulates the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), prohibits us from discriminating against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category, such as race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age, and requires us to notify credit applicants of any action taken on the individual’s credit application. 
 Consumer Reports and Information. The use of consumer reports and other personal data used in credit underwriting is governed by the FCRA and similar state laws governing the use of consumer credit information. The FCRA establishes requirements that apply to the use of “consumer reports” and similar data, including certain notifications to consumers where their loan application has been denied because of information contained in their consumer report. The FCRA requires us to promptly update any credit information reported to a credit reporting agency about a consumer and to allow a process by which consumers may inquire about credit information furnished by us to a consumer reporting agency. 
 Information-Sharing Laws. We are also subject to the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which limits the sharing of information with affiliates for marketing purposes and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting, preventing and responding appropriately to mitigate identity theft and to adopt various policies and procedures and provide training and materials 
 12


that address the importance of protecting non-public personal information and aid us in detecting and responding to suspicious activity, including suspicious activity that may suggest a possible identity theft red flag, as appropriate. 
 Marketing Laws. Our advertising and marketing activities are subject to several federal laws and regulations including the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”), which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices and false or misleading advertisements in all aspects of our business. As a financial services company, any advertisements related to our products must also comply with the advertising requirements set forth in TILA. Also, any of our telephone marketing activities must comply with the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the “TCPA”) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (the “TSR”). The TCPA prohibits the use of automatic telephone dialing systems for communications with wireless phone numbers without express consent of the consumer, and the TSR established the Do Not Call Registry and sets forth standards of conduct for all telemarketing. Our advertising and marketing activities are also subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, which establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to the source of content. 
 Protection of Military Members and Dependents. The Military Lending Act (“MLA”) is a federal law that limits the annual percentage rate to 36% on certain consumer loans made to active duty members of the U.S. military, reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate families. The MLA’s implementing regulation also contains various disclosure requirements, limitations on renewals and refinancing, as well as restrictions on the use of prepayment penalties, arbitration provisions and certain waivers of rights. The 36% annual percentage rate cap applies to a variety of consumer loan products, including short-term consumer loans. Therefore, due to these rate restrictions, we are unable to offer certain short-term consumer loans to active duty military personnel, active reservists and members of the National Guard and their immediate dependents. Federal law also limits the annual percentage rate on existing loans when the borrower, or spouse of the borrower, becomes an active-duty member of the military during the life of a loan. Pursuant to federal law, the interest rate must be reduced to 6% per year on amounts outstanding during the time in which the servicemember is on active duty.Funds Transfer and Signature Authentication Laws. The consumer loan business is also subject to the federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act (“EFTA”), and various other laws, rules and guidelines relating to the procedures and disclosures required in debiting or crediting a debtor’s bank account relating to a consumer loan (i.e., Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) funds transfer). Furthermore, we are subject to various state and federal e-signature rules mandating that certain disclosures be made and certain steps be followed in order to obtain and authenticate e-signatures. 
 Debt Collection Practices. We use the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) as a guide in connection with operating our other collection activities. We are also required to comply with all applicable state collection practices laws. 
 Privacy and Security of Non-Public Customer Information. We are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Under these laws, including the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), we must disclose to consumers our privacy policy and practices, including those policies relating to the sharing of consumers’ nonpublic personal information with third parties. This disclosure must be made to consumers when the customer relationship is established and, in some cases, at least annually thereafter. These regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. These regulations also dictate certain actions that we must take to notify consumers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner. 
 Anti-Money Laundering and Economic Sanctions. We are also subject to certain provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act under which we must maintain an anti-money laundering compliance program covering certain of our business activities. In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) prohibits us from engaging in financial transactions with specially designated nationals. Certain of our subsidiaries are also registered as money services businesses with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Department”) and must re-register with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) at least every two years if conducting money services business. 
 Anticorruption. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits companies and their agents or intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits.

CFPB 
 In July 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), which regulates consumer financial products and services, including consumer loans that we offer. The CFPB has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of such providers. Pursuant to these powers, the CFPB has examined our lending products, services and practices, and we expect to continue to be examined on a regular basis by the CFPB.
 On November 20, 2013, Cash America International, Inc. (“Cash America”), our parent company at the time, consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB pursuant to which it agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2012 examination of Cash America and us, to pay a civil money penalty of $5 million. The Consent Order relates in part to issues self-disclosed to the CFPB by us, including the making of a limited number of loans to consumers who may have been active-duty members of the military at the time of the loan at rates in excess of the annual percentage rate permitted by the federal Military Lending Act, and for which we made refunds of approximately $33,500, and for certain failures to timely provide and preserve records and information in connection with the CFPB’s examination of us. In addition, as a result of the CFPB’s review, we enhanced and continue to enhance our compliance management system and implemented additional policies and procedures to address the issues identified by the CFPB. These policies, procedures and other initiatives are in many cases subject to review and potential objection by the CFPB. We remain subject to the restrictions and obligations of the Consent Order, including the CFPB’s order that we ensure compliance with federal consumer financial laws and develop more robust compliance policies and procedures. 
 On July 10, 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule prohibiting the use of mandatory arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions in consumer financial services contracts. On November 1, 2017, President Trump signed a joint resolution passed by the House and Senate pursuant to the Congressional Review Act disapproving the CFPB arbitration rule and blocking it from taking effect. The joint resolution also precludes an agency from reissuing a rule in substantially the same form unless the reissued rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted subsequent to the President signing the joint resolution of disapproval. 
 On October 6, 2017, the CFPB issued its Final Rule (the “Final Rule”) on Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans. The Final Rule would impose significant limitations on all short-term loans and longer-term loans with balloon payments. Among other provisions, the Final Rule requires lenders to conduct a specific assessment regarding a borrower’s ability to repay, including a requirement to verify borrowers’ income and major financial obligations. The Final Rule also includes limitations on the number of loans that certain borrowers can have within a specified time frame and requires additional disclosures in loan documents and notices and limitations regarding payments. The Final Rule was published in the Federal Register on November 17, 2017 and would apply to loan contracts entered into beginning August 19, 2019. On January 16, 2018, the CFPB issued a statement that it intends to engage in a rulemaking process to reconsider the Final Rule. On February 6, 2019, the CFPB issued two notices of proposed rulemaking: (1) to rescind the Final Rule’s mandatory underwriting provisions, including the ability to repay requirements and (2) to delay the August 19, 2019 compliance date for those provisions until November 19, 2020. The proposed rescission of the underwriting provisions is open to public comment for 90 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. The delay is open to public comment for 30 days. The provisions relating to payments are still scheduled to take effect on August 19, 2019. It is likely that there will be legal challenges to the Final Rule before it goes into effect.
For further discussion of the CFPB and its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination authority over our U.S. consumer lending business that could have a significant impact on our U.S. business” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 U.S. State Regulation 
 Our consumer lending business is regulated under a variety of enabling state statutes, all of which are subject to change and which may impose significant costs or limitations on the way we conduct or expand our business. As of the date of this report, we offer or arrange consumer loans in 32 states that have specific statutes and regulations that enable us to offer economically viable products. We currently do not offer consumer loans in the remaining states or in the District of Columbia because we do not believe it is economically feasible to operate in those jurisdictions due to specific statutory or regulatory restrictions, such as interest rate ceilings, caps on the fees that may be charged, or costly operational requirements. However, we may later offer our consumer products or services in any of these states or the District of Columbia if we believe doing so may become economically viable because of changes in applicable statutes or regulations or if we determine we can broaden our product offerings to operate under existing laws and regulations. 
 The scope of state regulation of consumer loans, including the fees and terms of our products and services, varies from state to state. The terms of our products and services vary from state to state in order to comply with the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. In addition, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to review under various state consumer 
 14


protection laws and other applicable laws and regulations. The states with laws that specifically regulate our consumer products and services may limit the principal amount of a consumer loan and set maximum fees or interest rates customers may be charged. Some states also limit a customer’s ability to renew a short-term consumer loan and require various disclosures to consumers. State statutes often specify minimum and maximum maturity dates for short-term consumer loans such as ours and, in some cases, specify mandatory cooling-off periods between transactions. Our collection activities regarding past due amounts may be subject to consumer protection laws and state regulations relating to debt collection practices. In addition, some states require certain disclosures or content to accompany our advertising or marketing materials. Also, some states require us to report short-term consumer loan activity to state-wide databases and restrict the number and/or principal amount of loans a consumer may have outstanding at any particular time or over the course of a particular period of time, typically twelve months. 
 In Texas and Ohio, where we offer our CSO programs, we comply with the applicable jurisdiction’s Credit Services Organization Act or a similar statute. These laws generally define the services that we can provide to consumers and require us to provide a contract to the customer outlining our services and the cost of those services to the customer. In addition, these laws may require additional disclosures to consumers and may require us to be registered with the jurisdiction and/or be bonded. 
 We must also comply with state restrictions on the use of lead providers. Over the past few years, several states have taken actions that have caused us to discontinue the use of lead providers in those states. Other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers in the future. In October 2018, Ohio enacted House Bill 123. The law has an implementation date of April 27, 2019, and places new restrictions on companies operating under the Ohio Credit Services Organization Act, the Ohio Small Loan Act, and the Ohio General Loan Law. We are considering our options after the implementation date of the law because we are currently offering services under the Credit Services Organization Act.
 Over the last few years, legislation that prohibits or severely restricts our consumer loan products and services has been introduced or adopted in a number of states. As a result, we have ceased making consumer loans in several states where we formerly made such loans, and we have also modified our business operations in other states where restrictive legislation has been enacted. For example, Maryland passed a law in 2017 that limits the total fees, charges and interest that can be assessed on unsecured revolving credit plans with Maryland consumers to an effective rate of 33% per year. The law went into effect on July 1, 2017 with regard to new revolving credit plans. Additional legislation or regulations targeting or otherwise directly affecting our products and services have also been recently passed in several states. We regularly monitor proposed legislation or regulations that could affect our business. 
 Local Regulation—United States 
 In addition to state and federal laws and regulations, the short-term loan industry is subject to various local rules and regulations. These local rules and regulations are subject to change and vary widely from city to city. Local jurisdictions’ efforts to restrict short-term lending have been increasing. Typically, these local ordinances apply to storefront operations, however, local jurisdictions could attempt to enforce certain business conduct and registration requirements on online lenders lending to residents of that jurisdiction. Actions taken in the future by local governing bodies to impose other restrictions on short-term lenders such as us could impact our business. 
International Regulation 
 United Kingdom 
 In the United Kingdom, we are subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), and must comply with the FCA’s rules and regulations set forth in the FCA Handbook, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”), the Consumer Credit Act 1974, as amended (the “CCA”), and secondary legislation passed under the CCA, among other rules and regulations. We must also follow the Irresponsible Lending Guidance, or the Guidance, of the Office of Fair Trading (the “OFT”), which provides greater clarity for lenders as to business practices that the OFT (and the FCA) believes constitute irresponsible lending under the CCA. In January 2016, we received full authorization from the FCA to provide consumer credit and to perform related activities. We will be required to continue to satisfy certain minimum standards set out in the FSMA, which will result in additional costs to us. 
 The FCA regulates consumer credit and related activities in accordance with the guidance of the FSMA and the FCA Handbook, which includes prescriptive regulations and carries across many of the standards set out in the CCA and its secondary legislation as well as the Guidance. The FSMA gives the FCA the power to authorize, supervise, examine and bring enforcement actions against providers of consumer credit such as us, as well as to make rules for the regulation of consumer credit. On February 28, 2014, the FCA issued the Consumer Credit Sourcebook (“CONC”), which incorporates prescriptive regulations for lenders such as us, including mandatory affordability checks on borrowers, limiting the number of rollovers on short-term loans to two, restricting how lenders can advertise, banning advertisements that the FCA deems misleading, and introducing a limit of two unsuccessful attempts on the use of continuous payment authority (which provides a creditor the ability to directly debit a customer’s account for payment when authorized by the customer to do so) to pay off a loan. Certain provisions of the CONC took effect on April 1, 2014, and other 
 15


provisions for high-cost short-term credit providers such as us, such as the limits on rollovers, continuous payment authority and advertising, took effect on July 1, 2014. 
 After issuing a Call for Input on November 29, 2016, the FCA issued findings on July 31, 2017 deciding to maintain the high-cost short-term credit price cap at its current level and committing to review it within three years to ensure that it remains effective. The FCA found that regulation of high-cost short-term credit, including the price cap, has led to substantial benefits to consumers. The FCA also highlighted its priorities for the next stage of the review, which will focus on overdrafts, rent-to-own, home-collected credit and catalog credit. In November 2018, the FCA issued a consultation on its proposed price cap on rent-to-own (“RTO”) products. In December 2018, the FCA issued final rules and guidance concerning rent-to-own good, home-collected credit, catalogue credit and store cards, and Buy Now Pay Later (“BNPL”) products. Also in December, the FCA issued a consultation paper proposing new rules on overdrafts. None of the new or proposed rules applies to high-cost short-term credit (payday loans).
 The FCA previously stated that measures taken by it with respect to the payday loan industry would likely force about a quarter of the firms out of the industry in the United Kingdom. For recent developments related to the FCA, including serious concerns that were previously expressed by the FCA regarding our compliance with U.K. legal and regulatory requirements, such as the requirement that our business be capable of being effectively supervised by the FCA and compliance with FCA rules and principles and our affordability assessment and debt forbearance practices, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry— Our primary regulators in the United Kingdom previously expressed serious concerns about our compliance with applicable U.K. regulations, which caused us to make significant changes to our U.K. business that negatively impacted our operations and results, and future changes to our operations as a result of regulator concerns could have a material adverse effect on our U.K. business.,” “— The United Kingdom has imposed, and continues to impose, increased regulation of the short-term high-cost credit industry and previously stated its expectation that some firms will exit the market,” and “— Competition regulators in the United Kingdom have reviewed and may in the future again review our industry and, together with the FCA, could require lenders to implement changes to their operations, which could have a negative effect on our operations in the United Kingdom. in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
 Furthermore, we are subject to the Bribery Act, which prohibits the giving or receiving of a bribe to any person, including but not limited to public officials, and makes failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations a criminal offense. This offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribes anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business. The Bribery Act is applicable to businesses that operate in the United Kingdom such as us. The Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in the United States in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the U.S. FCPA.
 On July 30, 2018, the FCA published Policy Statement 18/19: assessing creditworthiness in consumer credit: feedback on CP 17/27 and final rules and guidance ("PS 18/19”) and went into effect on November 1, 2018. PS 18/19 introduced new rules and guidance the purpose of which was to clarify existing rules and guidance in CONC regarding responsible lending, post-contractual requirements, and the application of the general requirements on firms in the Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls sourcebook (“SYSC”). The new rules set forth in PS 18/19 went into effect on November 1, 2018. There are also some minor consequential changes to other parts of CONC, and the Handbook Glossary. In following the new rules and guidance, the FCA states that firms should use their judgement to decide what is appropriate in the circumstances. There may be multiple ways in which firms can comply with the new rules, and it wants firms to have a reasonable degree of flexibility according to the nature of the product and customer base. Given the broad nature of PS 18/19, if in the future, the FCA interprets PS 18/19’s guidance in a manner inconsistent with how we interpreted the guidance, there may be a potential risk for redress.
 HM Treasury issued a consultation on proposals for “breathing space” for borrowers struggling with repayment. The consultation sets out proposals for a statutory debt repayment plan. The deadline for responses to the consultation is January 29, 2019. We think any statutory breathing space for debt repayment may limit or alter our collection procedures. 
 On July 26, 2017, the FCA issued a Consultation Paper on proposed changes to its rules and guidance on individual accountability. The Senior Managers and Certification Regime currently applies to deposit taking institutions and, following the Bank of England and Financial Services Act 2016, is now being extended to FCA solo-regulated firms. The Senior Managers and Certification Regime would replace the Approved Persons Regime, changing how individuals working in financial services are regulated. The objective of the new Senior Managers and Certification Regime is to reduce harm to consumers and strengthen market integrity by making individuals more accountable for their conduct and competence. In July 2018, the FCA issued Policy Statement PS 18/14 titled “Extending the Senior Managers & Certification Regime to FCA Firms – Feedback to CP 17/25 and CP 17/40, and near final rules.” The vast majority of responses supported the FCA’s proposals or asked for clarification of the proposals. Therefore, the FCA intends to implement the proposals set out in CP 17/40 largely as proposed. PS 18/14 is effective December 9, 2019.
 The Criminal Finance Act 2017, which became effective in January 2018, amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, to expand provisions for confiscating funds associated with Terrorist Property and proceeds of tax evasion. This act creates the corporate 
 16


offenses of failure of a company to prevent facilitation of U.K. and foreign tax evasion. This has required us to enhance our systems and controls to prevent such facilitation.
 We are also subject to anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing requirements that require us to develop and maintain associated policies and procedures, including, but not limited to, customer due diligence, politically exposed person (“PEP”) and sanction screening and training and awareness of staff, as well as reporting suspicious activity, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000. The National Crime Agency (“NCA”) is a law enforcement agency created in 2013 to reduce the harm caused to people and communities in the United Kingdom by serious and organized crime. The NCA replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency (“SOCA”) and is charged with strengthening the U.K.’s borders, fighting fraud and cyber-crime and protecting children and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation. The NCA has the mandate and powers to work in partnership with other law enforcement organizations and has an international role of liaising with overseas law enforcement agencies. It has a “four pillars” approach to fighting crime: pursue, prevent, protect and prepare. On June 26, 2017, the European Union’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive came into force, with an emphasis on employing a risk-based approach to money laundering. While the European Union’s Fifth Anti Money Laundering Directive was published in June 2018, it does not become effective until January 2020 and is considered to have little impact on us. In the United Kingdom, we are also subject to the requirements of the Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”) and are required to be fully registered as a data-controller under the DPA. The DPA controls how organizations, businesses and/or the government use personal data and how they should process it. The current Data Protection regime aligns with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), a regulation by which the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for individuals within the European Union. It also addresses export of personal data outside the European Union. The primary objectives of the GDPR are to give citizens back the control of their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the European Union. When the GDPR takes effect, it will replace the previous data protection directive. The GDPR contains a number of new protections for E.U. data subjects and threatens significant fines and penalties for non-compliant data controllers and processors once it comes into effect. The regulation was adopted on April 27, 2016. It is effective May 25, 2018 after a two-year transition period and, unlike a directive, it does not require any enabling legislation to be passed by national governments.
 On February 2, 2016, the European Commission and the United States agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows, the “E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield”, which will replace the invalidated Safe Harbor framework. The E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield is a framework designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) and European Commission to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with E.U. personal data from the European Union to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce. On July 12, 2016, the European Commission adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, which consists of four components: (i) the privacy shield principles, which is a code of conduct outlining protections for the handling of personal data; (ii) oversight and enforcement; (iii) ombudsperson mechanism; and (iv) safeguards and limitations. The Commerce Department began accepting certifications to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield on August 1, 2016. Although we are exploring the possibility of applying for certification to the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, we continue to believe we are exempt from and/or are in compliance with all E.U. and U.K. privacy laws and regulations and will continue to be so under the GDPR.
 In the United Kingdom, we are also subject to specific anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing requirements that require us to develop and maintain anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing policies and procedures including reporting suspicious activity, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the Terrorism Act 2000. The National Crime Agency (“NCA”) is a law enforcement agency created in 2013 to reduce the harm caused to people and communities in the United Kingdom by serious and organized crime. The NCA replaced the Serious Organised Crime Agency and is charged with strengthening the U.K.’s borders, fighting fraud and cyber-crime and protecting children and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation. The NCA has the mandate and powers to work in partnership with other law enforcement organizations and has an international role of liaising with overseas law enforcement agencies. It has a “four pillars” approach to fighting crime: pursue, prevent, protect and prepare. On June 26, 2017, the European Union’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive came into force, with an emphasis on employing a risk-based approach to money laundering.
 Our U.K. operations are also overseen by the Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”), a public body established by the U.K. Parliament to carry out statutory functions on a non-commercial, not-for-profit basis. The FOS is the statutory dispute-resolution scheme set up under the FSMA. The FOS works closely with other U.K. regulators governing the financial services market.
 On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union. On March 29, 2017, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, thereby setting March 29, 2019 as the date the United Kingdom will leave the European Union. This date can be extended if all E.U. members agree to such extension. No further details of the exit have been finalized. When the United Kingdom exits the European Union, it is expected that the United Kingdom will establish a new framework for data flow between the United Kingdom and the United States or will agree to continue the protections of the GDPR for the transfer of personal data into and out of the United Kingdom. We expect to comply with any framework established by the United Kingdom for the transfer of personal data into and out of the United Kingdom.
