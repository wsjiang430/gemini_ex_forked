Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Unifi, Inc., a New York corporation formed in 1969 (together with its subsidiaries, “UNIFI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a multi-national company that manufactures and sells innovative recycled and synthetic products made from polyester and nylon primarily to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers (UNIFI’s direct customers) that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets (UNIFI’s indirect customers).  We refer to these indirect customers as “brand partners.” Polyester yarns include partially oriented yarn (“POY”), textured, solution and package dyed, twisted, beamed and draw wound yarns, and each is available in virgin or recycled varieties. Recycled solutions, made from both pre-consumer and post-consumer waste, include plastic bottle flake (“Flake”) and polyester polymer beads (“Chip”).  Nylon yarns include virgin or recycled textured, solution dyed and spandex covered yarns.
 UNIFI maintains one of the textile industry’s most comprehensive product offerings that include a range of specialized, premium value-added (“PVA”) and commodity solutions, with principal geographic markets in the Americas, Asia and Europe. 
 UNIFI has direct manufacturing operations in four countries and participates in joint ventures in Israel and the United States (“U.S.”), the most significant of which is a 34% non-controlling partnership interest in Parkdale America, LLC (“PAL”), a significant unconsolidated affiliate that produces cotton and synthetic yarns for sale to the global textile industry and apparel market. We believe the investment in PAL provides strategic diversification for UNIFI’s overall business in response to global textile trends. PAL is a limited liability company treated as a partnership for income tax reporting purposes. 
 UNIFI has four reportable segments:
  
• | The Polyester Segment primarily sells polyester-based products to other yarn manufacturers and knitters and weavers that produce yarn and/or fabric for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end‑use markets. The Polyester Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S. and El Salvador. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Nylon Segment primarily sells nylon-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric primarily for the apparel and hosiery markets. The Nylon Segment consists of sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Colombia. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Brazil Segment primarily sells polyester-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets principally in South America. The Brazil Segment includes a manufacturing location and sales offices in Brazil. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Asia Segment primarily sells polyester-based products to knitters and weavers that produce fabric for the apparel, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets principally in Asia. The Asia Segment includes sales offices in China, Turkey, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Other information for UNIFI’s reportable segments is provided in Note 26, “Business Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  In addition to UNIFI’s reportable segments, UNIFI conducts certain ancillary operations that include for-hire transportation services, which comprise an All Other category. The ancillary operations classified within All Other are immaterial to UNIFI’s consolidated financial statements. In discussion of our operating results in this Annual Report, we refer to our operations in the “NACA” region, which is the region comprised of the trade zones covered by the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and the Dominican Republic—Central America Free Trade Agreement (“CAFTA-DR”).  In previous filings, we have referred to this region as “the Region,” and we have referred to our operations within this region as our “Regional operations.”
 Operating and Strategic Overview
 UNIFI reported net income of $2,456, or $0.13 per diluted share, for fiscal 2019. These results primarily reflect (i) weaker fixed cost absorption resulting from lower textured yarn volumes in connection with significant competitive pressure from imported textured polyester into the U.S., (ii) unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts, (iii) a volatile raw material cost environment, (iv) a challenging domestic landscape in which achieving raw material related selling price increases was difficult against cost-competitive imports, (v) lower earnings from PAL and (vi) a significantly higher effective tax rate than in fiscal 2018.  These negative impacts were partially offset by the benefits of (a) growth in sales of PVA products in the Asia Segment and (b) an additional week of sales in fiscal 2019 in the NACA region. 
 The Asia Segment continued strong sales performance, primarily due to the global success of UNIFI’s PVA portfolio. The Polyester Segment was adversely impacted by significant levels of imported polyester textured yarn and periodic increases in the costs of raw materials, along with certain pricing and demand challenges in the NACA region. Global demand trends for certain nylon products declined and continued to pressure the results of the Nylon Segment.  The Brazil Segment was adversely impacted by margin pressure from periodic increases in raw material costs and competition.

Despite elevated competitive pressures and periodic raw material cost increases, we believe UNIFI’s underlying performance during recent fiscal years reflects the strength of our global initiative to deliver PVA solutions to customers and brand partners throughout the world. Our supply chain has been developed and enhanced in multiple regions of the globe, allowing us to deliver a diverse range of synthetic fibers and polymers to key customers in the markets we serve, especially apparel. These polyester and nylon products are supported by quality assurance, product development and other customer service teams across UNIFI’s operating subsidiaries. We have developed this successful operating platform by: improving operational and business processes; enriching the product mix by growing sales of higher-margin PVA products; and deriving value from sustainability-based initiatives, including polyester and nylon recycling.
 This platform has provided growth in our core operations during recent fiscal years, and has been augmented by significant capital investments that support the production and delivery of sustainable and innovative solutions. In order to achieve further growth, UNIFI is committed to investing strategically and synergistically in:
  
1. | Technology, innovation and sustainability;
---+-------------------------------------------


2. | High-quality brand and supplier relationships; and
---+---------------------------------------------------


3. | Supply chain expansion and optimization.
---+-----------------------------------------

 We believe that further commercial expansion will require a continued stream of new technology and innovation that generates products with consumer-meaningful benefits. Along with REPREVE®, UNIFI has significant yarn technologies that provide optimal performance characteristics for today’s marketplace, including moisture management, temperature moderation, stretch, ultra-violet protection and fire retardation. To achieve further growth, UNIFI remains focused on innovation, bringing to market the next wave of fibers and polymers for tomorrow’s applications. As we invest and grow, sustainability remains at our core. We believe that increasing the awareness for recycled solutions in applications across fibers and polymers, particularly with PVA solutions, and furthering sustainability-based initiatives with like-minded brand partners will be key to our future success. Growth will also require high-quality partnerships. With a changing retail landscape and a dynamic consumer, brands are demanding fast fashion and localized supply chains. In order to capitalize on these shifts, we expect to identify and enter into partnerships and commercial relationships that expand our global footprint in strategic regions. As the Americas and Asia remain significant components of the global supply chain, UNIFI will be diligent in exploring partnerships that advance our existing growth platform in these regions.
 Our recent efforts to alleviate competitive pressures from imported polyester yarn into the U.S. are intended to complement our strategic initiatives and to stabilize the market share decline we have experienced in the U.S. These efforts are further discussed below under the heading “Trade Regulation and Rules of Origin.” Execution on both our strategic and trade initiatives is expected to drive expansion in gross margin and to increase revenue and profitability.
 Further discussion of the significant components of UNIFI’s recent performance and its capital allocation strategies is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Annual Report”).
 PVA Products and REPREVE®
 UNIFI remains committed to growing the business for its PVA products and believes its research and development work with brands and retailers continues to create new, worldwide sales opportunities.  UNIFI’s goal is to increase its global PVA sales by more than 10% per year and to generate overall mix enrichment and margin gains.  UNIFI’s PVA products represented approximately 47% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019, and revenue from PVA products grew by 10% over fiscal 2018.  UNIFI’s strategy of enhancing its product mix through a focus on PVA products has helped establish UNIFI as an innovation leader in its core markets and provides diversification from certain global competitors.
 REPREVE® is our flagship brand and our fastest growing brand.  As part of our efforts to expand consumer brand recognition of REPREVE®, UNIFI has developed recycling-focused sponsorships with various brand partners and other entities that span across sporting, music and outdoor events. The increasing success and awareness of the REPREVE® brand continues to provide new opportunities for growth, allowing for expansion into new end uses and markets for REPREVE®, as well as continued growth of the brand with current customers.  This has driven traction with global brands and retailers who obtain value and lasting consumer interest from the innovation and sustainability aspects that REPREVE® provides.
 PVA Expansion and Capital Investments
 In fiscal 2015, we began a significant, three-year capital investment plan to increase our PVA capabilities and capacity, expand our technological foundation and customize our asset base to improve our ability to deliver small-lot and high-value solutions. These investments were made primarily for the Polyester Segment.
 Most notably, we made significant investments in the production and supply chain for REPREVE®, including backward integration with a bottle processing plant and additional production lines in the REPREVE® Recycling Center. Further, UNIFI (i) installed bi-component spinning machinery to produce specialized, high-value yarns and (ii) made machinery modifications to meet the ever-changing demands of the market, in support of the PVA product portfolio, all while (iii) investing in routine capital maintenance to ensure high-quality manufacturing.
 Subsequent to the multi-year capital investment plan, and specific to fiscal 2019, we invested approximately $25,000 in capital projects, which included (i) making further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the Americas and (ii) annual maintenance capital expenditures.

In fiscal 2020 and 2021, UNIFI expects to invest an additional $25,000 and $30,000 in capital projects, respectively, which we expect to include (i) making further improvements in production capabilities and technology enhancements in the Americas, including the purchase and installation of new eAFK Evo texturing machines, and (ii) annual maintenance capital expenditures.
 Share Repurchases
 
In addition to capital investments and debt retirement, UNIFI may utilize excess cash for strategic share repurchases. On April 23, 2014, UNIFI announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) had approved a share repurchase program (the “2014 SRP”) under which UNIFI was authorized to acquire up to $50,000 of its common stock. Through October 31, 2018 (the date the 2014 SRP was terminated, as noted below), UNIFI had repurchased a total of 806 shares, at an average price of $27.79 (for a total of $22,409, inclusive of commission costs), pursuant to the 2014 SRP. 
 
On October 31, 2018, UNIFI announced that the Board had terminated the 2014 SRP and approved a new share repurchase program (the “2018 SRP”) under which UNIFI is authorized to acquire up to $50,000 of its common stock. Under the 2018 SRP, purchases will be made from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices, through private transactions or block trades. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date. As of June 30, 2019, $50,000 remained available for repurchase under the 2018 SRP. UNIFI will continue to evaluate opportunities to use excess cash flows from operations or existing borrowings to repurchase additional stock, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to support its operational needs and to fund future strategic growth opportunities.
 Developments in Principal Markets
 Leading up to fiscal 2017, apparel production experienced multi-year growth in the NACA region, which comprises the principal markets for UNIFI’s Polyester and Nylon Segments. The share of synthetic apparel production for these regions as a percentage of U.S. retail stabilized at approximately 18%, while retail consumption grew. The CAFTA-DR region, which continues to be a competitive alternative to Asian supply chains for textile products, maintained its share of synthetic apparel supply to U.S. retailers. The relative share of synthetic apparel versus cotton apparel as a proportion of the overall apparel market increased and provided growth for the consumption of synthetic yarns within the CAFTA-DR region. 
 In fiscal 2017 and 2018, UNIFI’s operations in the NACA region experienced fluctuations in demand as the retail and apparel markets experienced difficult conditions characterized by reduced retail traffic, a weak winter selling season and growth in online sales channels. During calendar 2016 and 2017, these factors combined to cause bankruptcies, store closures and other transformations for traditional retail enterprises. Fiscal 2018 and 2019 were further adversely impacted by retailers and brand partners seeking more cost competitive textile supplies in response to rising and higher raw material costs, while elevated levels of imported polyester textured yarn impacted the domestic textile industry. As consumers demand fast fashion, personalized experiences and omni-channel outlets, the retail market and its supply chain are expected to change. Transformational requirements for the supply chain are not yet clear but will be an integral part of UNIFI’s initiatives going forward.
 UNIFI’s Asian operations remain an important part of our global strategy, enhancing our ability to service customers with global supply chains.  Competition in the Asian region remains high; however, interest and demand for UNIFI’s PVA products in Asia have helped support strong sales volumes in recent years. The margin profile has been impacted primarily by significant growth of lower-margin products, raw material cost fluctuations and competitive pricing pressures. However, we are encouraged by programs undertaken with key brands and retailers that benefit from the diversification and innovation of our global PVA solutions. 
 UNIFI’s Brazilian operations also play a key role in our global strategy. This segment is primarily impacted by price pressures from imported fiber, fabric and finished goods (to a similar extent as our U.S. operations), the inflation rate in Brazil and changes in the value of the Brazilian Real (“BRL”).  Competition and economic and political volatility remain challenging conditions in South America, but UNIFI continues to (i) aggressively pursue mix enrichment by working with customers to develop programs using our differentiated products and PVA yarns and (ii) implement process improvements and manufacturing efficiency plans to help lower per-unit costs.
 UNIFI’s operations in Asia and Brazil have been critical to global growth and expansion of PVA products. Looking ahead, we expect expansion into additional markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East utilizing the supply chain and service model that has been successful for us in Asia.
 As we expand our global operations, we will continue to evaluate the level of capital investment required to support the needs of our customers and intend to appropriately allocate our resources accordingly.

Industry Overview
 UNIFI operates in the textile industry and, within that broad category, the respective markets for yarns, fabrics, fibers and end-use products, such as apparel and hosiery, automotive, industrial products and home furnishings.  Even though the textile industry is global, there are several distinctive regional or other geographic markets that often shape the business strategies and operations of participants in the industry.  Because of free trade agreements and other trade regulations entered into by the U.S. government, the U.S. textile industry, which is otherwise a distinctive geographic market on its own, is often considered in conjunction with other geographic markets or regions in North, South and Central America, such as the NACA region.  The Company’s principal markets for its domestic operations are in the NACA region. 
 According to data compiled by PCI WoodMackenzie, a global leader in research and analysis for the polyester and raw material markets, global demand for polyester yarns, which includes both filament and staple yarns, has grown steadily since 1980, and, in calendar 2003, polyester replaced cotton as the fiber with the largest percentage of worldwide sales.  In calendar 2018, global polyester consumption accounted for an estimated 56% of global fiber consumption, and global demand is projected to increase by approximately 3.0% to 3.5% annually through calendar 2025.  In calendar 2018, global nylon consumption accounted for an estimated 5% of global fiber consumption.  However, the continued decline in the U.S. nylon market during fiscal 2019 had an unfavorable impact on UNIFI’s Nylon Segment. Additionally, due to the higher cost of nylon, the industry may transition certain products from nylon to polyester. The polyester and nylon fiber sectors together accounted for approximately 61% of North American textile consumption during calendar 2018.
 According to the National Council of Textile Organizations, the U.S. textile and apparel industry’s total shipments were approximately $76.8 billion for calendar 2018 as the U.S. textile and apparel industry exported nearly $30.1 billion of textile and apparel products, and the exports have grown by approximately 50% since 2009, an increase of over $10.0 billion. The U.S. textile industry remains a large manufacturing employer.
 Trade Regulation and Rules of Origin
 The duty rate on imports into the U.S. of finished apparel categories that utilize polyester and nylon yarns generally range from 16% to 32%. For many years, imports of fabric and finished goods into the U.S. have increased significantly from countries that do not participate in free trade agreements or trade preference programs, despite duties charged on those imports. The primary drivers for that growth were lower overseas operating costs, foreign government subsidization of textile industries, increased overseas sourcing by U.S. retailers, the entry of China into the World Trade Organization and the staged elimination of all textile and apparel quotas. Although global apparel imports represent a significant percentage of the U.S. market, Regional FTAs (as defined below), which follow general “yarn forward” rules of origin, provide duty free advantages for apparel made from regional fibers, yarns and fabrics, allowing UNIFI opportunities to participate in this growing market.
 
A significant number of UNIFI’s customers in the apparel market produce finished goods that meet the eligibility requirements for duty-free treatment in the regions covered by NACA and the Colombia and Peru free trade agreements (collectively, the “Regional FTAs”). These Regional FTAs contain rules of origin requirements in order for covered products to be eligible for duty-free treatment. In the case of textiles such as fabric, yarn (such as POY), fibers (filament and staple) and certain garments made from them, the products are generally required to be fully formed within the respective regions. UNIFI is the largest filament yarn manufacturer, and one of the few producers of qualifying synthetic yarns, in the regions covered by these Regional FTAs. 
 The renegotiation of NAFTA has been a priority for the Trump administration over the past 18 months. The U.S. has a positive trade balance in the textile and apparel sector in NAFTA, and UNIFI anticipates the modifications made under the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (the “USMCA”) in this sector will not significantly impact textile and apparel trade in the region if/when it is enacted. The proposed USMCA does include strong rules of origin and closes several loopholes in the original NAFTA that allowed non-originating inputs, such as sewing thread and pocketing.  The USMCA will need to be ratified by all three countries before it is enacted.
 U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the “Berry Amendment” stipulates that certain textile and apparel articles purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense must be manufactured in the U.S. and must consist of yarns and fibers produced in the U.S. UNIFI is the largest producer of synthetic yarns for Berry Amendment compliant purchasing programs.
 UNIFI refers to fibers sold with specific rules of origin requirements under the Regional FTAs and the Berry Amendment, as “Compliant Yarns.”  Approximately two-thirds of UNIFI’s sales within the Polyester and Nylon Segments are sold as Compliant Yarns under the terms of the Regional FTAs or the Berry Amendment.
 UNIFI believes the requirements of the rules of origin and the associated duty-free cost advantages in the Regional FTAs, together with the Berry Amendment and the growing demand for supplier responsiveness and improved inventory turns, will ensure that a portion of the existing textile industry will remain based in the Americas. UNIFI expects that the NACA region will continue to maintain its share of apparel production as a percentage of U.S. retail. UNIFI believes the remaining synthetic apparel production within these NACA region markets is more specialized and defensible, and, in some cases, apparel producers are bringing programs back to the NACA region as part of a balanced sourcing strategy for some brands and retailers.  Because UNIFI is the largest of only a few significant producers of Compliant Yarns under these Regional FTAs, one of UNIFI’s business strategies is to continue to leverage its eligibility status for duty-free processing to increase its share of business with regional and domestic fabric producers who ship their products into this region.

Over the longer term, the textile industry in the NACA region is expected to continue to be impacted by Asian supply chains where costs are much lower and regulation is limited.
 Imports of polyester textured yarn from China and India - which increased approximately 79% from calendar 2013 to 2017 and which continued to grow during calendar 2018 - remained elevated during fiscal 2019, creating considerable pressure on our margins and competitiveness in the U.S.  Accordingly, in October 2018, UNIFI filed antidumping and countervailing duty cases with the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Commerce Department”) and the International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging that dumped and subsidized imports of polyester textured yarn from China and India are causing material injury to the domestic polyester textured yarn industry.
 In response to antidumping and countervailing duty cases filed with the Commerce Department and the ITC in October 2018, the Commerce Department announced on April 29, 2019 affirmative preliminary countervailing duty determinations on unfairly subsidized imports of polyester textured yarn from (i) China at rates of 32% or more and (ii) India at rates of 7% or more.  In addition, on June 26, 2019, the Commerce Department announced affirmative preliminary antidumping duty determinations on imports of polyester textured yarn from (i) China at rates of 65% or more and (ii) India at rates of 10% or more. While final determinations of dumping, subsidization and injury are expected by the end of calendar 2019, cash deposits for the  preliminary countervailing and antidumping duties are currently being collected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, from the importer of record, on the subject imports. Thus, the preliminary countervailing and antidumping duties are effectively increasing the U.S-based price of subject imported yarn from China by approximately 100%.
 While the ultimate short-term and long-term impacts of these duties is not yet known, UNIFI expects these countervailing and antidumping duty rates to play a significant role in helping to normalize the competitive position of UNIFI’s yarns in the U.S. market against the respective imported yarns.
 Competition
 The industry in which UNIFI operates is global and highly competitive.  UNIFI competes not only as a global yarn producer, but also as part of a regional supply chain for certain textile products.  For sales of Compliant Yarns, UNIFI competes with a limited number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns.  For sales of non-Compliant Yarns, UNIFI competes with a larger number of foreign and domestic producers of polyester and nylon yarns who can meet the required customer specifications of quality, reliability and timeliness. UNIFI is affected by imported textile, apparel and hosiery products, which adversely impact demand for UNIFI’s polyester and nylon products in certain of its markets.  Several foreign competitors have significant advantages, including lower wages, raw material costs and capital costs, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar (“USD”), any of which could make UNIFI’s products, or the related supply chains, less competitive. While competitors have traditionally focused on high-volume commodity products, they are now increasingly focused on specialty and PVA products that UNIFI historically has been able to leverage to generate higher margins.
 UNIFI’s major competitors for polyester yarns are United Textiles Of America S.De R.L. De C.V., O’Mara, Inc. and NanYa Plastics Corp. of America (“NanYa”) in the U.S.; AKRA, S.A. de C.V. in the NAFTA region; and C S Central America S.A. de C.V. in the CAFTA-DR region.  UNIFI’s major competitor in Brazil is Avanti Industria Comercio Importacao e Exportacao Ltda., among other traders of imported yarns and fibers.  UNIFI’s operations in Asia face competition from multiple yarn manufacturers in that region and identification of them is not feasible. However, almost all of our portfolio in that region is advantaged by PVA products and a global sourcing and support model that assists in differentiation.
 UNIFI’s major competitors for nylon yarns are Sapona Manufacturing Company, Inc. and McMichael Mills, Inc. in the U.S.
 Raw Materials, Suppliers and Sourcing
 The primary raw material supplier for the Polyester Segment of virgin Chip and POY is NanYa.  For the Brazil Segment, Reliance Industries, Ltd. is the main supplier of POY.  The primary suppliers of raw materials for the Nylon Segment are HN Fibers, Ltd., U.N.F. Industries Ltd. (“UNF”), UNF America, LLC (“UNFA”), The LYCRA Company and Nilit America, Inc. (“Nilit”).  Each of UNF and UNFA is a 50/50 joint venture between UNIFI and Nilit.  Currently, there are multiple domestic and foreign suppliers available to fulfill UNIFI’s sourcing requirements for its recycled products. The majority of plastic bottles we consume in the U.S. are obtained in open-market transactions from various entities throughout the U.S., while our Asian subsidiaries source Flake from various countries and entities throughout Asia.
 For its operations in the U.S., UNIFI produces and buys certain of its raw material fibers for Compliant Yarns from a variety of sources in both the U.S. and Israel, and UNIFI produces a portion of its Chip requirements in its REPREVE® Recycling Center and purchases the remainder of such requirements from external suppliers for use in its domestic spinning facility to produce POY.  In addition, UNIFI purchases nylon and polyester products for resale from various suppliers.  Although UNIFI does not generally have difficulty obtaining its raw material requirements, UNIFI has, in the past, experienced interruptions or limitations in the supply of certain raw materials.
 UNIFI’s bottle processing facility in Reidsville, North Carolina provides a high-quality source of Flake for the REPREVE® Recycling Center as well as for sale to external parties. Combined with recent technology advancements in recycling, we believe the Flake produced at the bottle processing facility will enhance our ability to grow REPREVE® into other markets, such as nonwovens, carpet fiber and packaging. However, since the bottle processing facility began producing at full utilization in fiscal 2018, plastic bottle costs have increased due, in part, to a tighter supply dynamic, pressuring UNIFI’s gross margins.

The prices of the principal raw materials used by UNIFI continuously fluctuate, and it is difficult, and often impossible, to predict trends or upcoming developments.  During fiscal 2017 and 2018, UNIFI operated in a predominantly increasing virgin polyester raw material cost environment, which continued in fiscal 2019 and included a temporary but significant spike in polyester raw material costs in September and October of 2018.  UNIFI believes that polyester raw material cost fluctuations during most of fiscal 2017 and 2018 were a result of volatility in the crude oil markets, while the cost spike experienced in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by supply and demand dynamics for certain polyester feedstocks. The continuing volatility in global crude oil prices is likely to impact UNIFI’s polyester and nylon raw material costs, but it is not possible to predict the timing or amount of the impact or whether the movement in crude oil prices will stabilize, increase or decrease. In any event, UNIFI monitors these dynamic factors closely and does not currently engage in hedges of polyester or nylon raw materials.
 Products, Technologies and Related Markets
 UNIFI manufactures and sells polyester yarns and related products in the U.S., El Salvador and Brazil, and nylon yarns in the U.S. and Colombia, for a wide range of end uses.  In Asia, UNIFI manages a network of vendors and suppliers to contract manufacture PVA solutions, including our added fiber technologies and REPREVE®, to direct and indirect customers around the globe.
 Our products sold across all geographies range from specialty, PVA and commodity. UNIFI’s most strategic portfolio, PVA products, comprised approximately 47%, 45% and 40% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We provide products to a variety of end-use markets, principally apparel, industrial, furnishings and automotive.
 The domestic apparel market, which includes hosiery, represents approximately 58% of UNIFI’s domestic sales.  Apparel retail sales, supply chain inventory levels and the strength of the regional supply base are vital to this market.  
 The domestic industrial market represents approximately 18% of UNIFI’s domestic sales. This market includes medical, belting, tapes, filtration, ropes, protective fabrics and awnings.
 The domestic furnishings market, which includes both contract and home furnishings, represents approximately 8% of UNIFI’s domestic sales.  Furnishings sales are largely dependent upon the housing market, which, in turn, is influenced by consumer confidence and credit availability.
 The domestic automotive market represents approximately 8% of UNIFI’s domestic sales and has been less susceptible to import penetration because of the exacting specifications and quality requirements often imposed on manufacturers of automotive fabrics, along with just-in-time delivery requirements.  Effective customer service and prompt response to customer feedback are logistically more difficult for an importer to provide.
 UNIFI also adds value to the overall supply chain for textile products, and increases consumer demand for UNIFI’s own products, through the development and introduction of branded yarns and technologies that provide unique sustainability, performance, comfort and aesthetic advantages.  UNIFI’s branded portion of its yarn portfolio continues to provide product differentiation to brand partners, mills and consumers, and is based on two core platforms, REPREVE® and PROFIBER™:
 REPREVE® is a family of sustainable products made from recycled materials, including plastic bottles.  Since its introduction in 2006, REPREVE® has become the global leader in branded recycled fibers.  REPREVE® recycled fibers may also be customized to provide leading performance and/or aesthetic properties, enabling a differentiated consumer experience.  Additionally, we developed the U TRUST® verification program to provide customers with the highest level of transparency. REPREVE® fabrics contains FiberPrint®, a proprietary technology used to analyze and validate REPREVE® content claims and composition.
 PROFIBER™ is a family of virgin, material-based performance yarn products that are similarly customizable with a broad selection of industry-leading technologies designed to deliver an array of consumer benefits. 
 
UNIFI’s branded yarns can be found in a variety of products of well-known brands, retailers and department stores, including Ford, Haggar, Polartec, Under Armour, The North Face, Patagonia, Quiksilver, Roxy, General Motors, Volcom, Pottery Barn, Lane Bryant, adidas, Nike, New Era Hat, MJ Soffe, Abercrombie & Fitch, Levi’s, H&M, TARGET, Express, Costco Wholesale, REI, Macy’s, Kohl’s, Belk, JC Penney, PVH, PACSUN, Zara, Hard Rock Café, Walmart, Bermuda Sands, Lovesac, BUFF and Aeropostale.
 In addition to the above brands and products, UNIFI combines its research and development efforts with the demands of customers and markets to develop innovative technologies that enhance yarn characteristics. Application of these technologies allows for various, separate benefits, including, among other things, water repellency, flame retardation, soil release, enhanced color-fastness achieved with less water use and protection from ultra-violet rays.
 Customers
 UNIFI’s Polyester Segment, Nylon Segment, Brazil Segment and Asia Segment have approximately 390, 140, 410 and 590 customers, respectively, all in a variety of geographic markets.  UNIFI’s products are manufactured according to customer specifications and are shipped based upon customer order requirements.  Customer payment terms are generally consistent with prevailing industry practices for the geographies in which we participate.

UNIFI’s consolidated net sales are not materially dependent on a single direct customer and no single direct customer accounts for 10% or more of UNIFI’s consolidated net sales. UNIFI’s top 10 direct customers accounted for approximately 28% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 and approximately 34% of receivables as of June 30, 2019.  However, UNIFI’s consolidated net sales are dependent on demand from a relatively small number of brand partners.  UNIFI’s net sales within its Nylon Segment are materially dependent upon a domestic customer that accounted for approximately 28% of the Nylon Segment’s net sales for fiscal 2019.
 Sales and Marketing
 UNIFI employs an internal sales force of approximately 50 persons operating out of sales offices primarily in the U.S., Brazil, China, Sri Lanka, El Salvador and Colombia.  UNIFI also relies on independent sales agents for sales in several other countries.  UNIFI seeks to create strong customer relationships and to build and strengthen those relationships throughout the supply chain.  Through having frequent communications with customers, partnering in product development and engaging key downstream brands and retailers, UNIFI has created significant pull-through sales and brand recognition for its products.  For example, UNIFI works with brands and retailers to educate and create demand for its PVA products, such as recent engagements involving REPREVE® at multiple events and venues in the U.S.  UNIFI then works with key fabric mill partners to develop specific fabrics for those brands and retailers utilizing its PVA products.  In many of these regards, UNIFI draws upon and integrates the resources of its research and development personnel.  In addition, UNIFI is enhancing co-branding activations with integrated point-of-sale and online marketing with popular brands and retailers to further enable consumers to find REPREVE® and other PVA brands in multiple retail channels.  Based on the establishment of many commercial and branded programs, this strategy has been successful for UNIFI.

 UNIFI uses advanced production processes to manufacture its high-quality products cost-effectively in North America, Central America and South America.  UNIFI believes that its flexibility and know-how in producing specialty polyester and nylon products provide important development and commercialization advantages, in addition to the recent ability to vertically integrate with post-industrial and post-consumer materials.
 UNIFI produces Flake, Chip and POY using recycled materials. In addition to its yarns manufactured from virgin polyester and nylon, UNIFI sells its recycled products externally or further processes them internally to add value for customers seeking recycled components. The REPREVE® Bottle Processing Center in Reidsville, North Carolina produces Flake that can be sold externally or further processed internally at our REPREVE® Recycling Center in Yadkinville, North Carolina. Recycled polyester Chip output from the REPREVE® Recycling Center can be sold externally or further processed internally into polyester POY.
 Additional processing of UNIFI’s polyester POY includes texturing, dyeing, twisting, beaming and draw winding.  The texturing process, which is common to both polyester and nylon, involves the use of high-speed machines to draw, heat and false-twist POY to produce yarn with different physical characteristics, depending on its ultimate end use.  Texturing gives the yarn greater bulk, strength, stretch, consistent dye-ability and a softer feel, thereby making it suitable for use in the knitting and weaving of fabric.  Solution dyeing and package dyeing allow for matching of customer-specific color requirements for yarns sold into various markets.  Twisting incorporates real twist into filament yarns, which can be sold for a variety of uses, such as sewing thread, home furnishings and apparel.  Beaming places both textured and covered yarns onto beams to be used by customers in warp knitting and weaving applications.  The draw winding process utilizes heat and draws POY to produce mid-tenacity, flat yarns.
 Additional processing of UNIFI’s nylon yarn products primarily includes covering and texturing. Covering involves the wrapping or air entangling of filament or spun yarn around a core yarn, primarily spandex.  This process enhances a fabric’s ability to stretch, recover its original shape and resist wrinkles, while maintaining a softer feel.
 UNIFI’s subsidiaries in Asia offer the same high-quality and innovative PVA products and technologies through contract manufacturing arrangements with local manufacturers. This asset-light model allows for seamless integration of our products into the global supply chain of our customers. As we expand our Asian operations to meet the needs of our global customers, we will continue to leverage the asset-light model where the existing infrastructure can accommodate our highly technical processes, while continually evaluating the need for additional UNIFI assets in response to ever-changing market dynamics.
 Research and Development
 UNIFI employs approximately 140 persons, primarily in the U.S., who work closely with UNIFI’s customers, brand partners and others to develop a variety of new yarns as well as improvements to the performance properties of existing yarns and fabrics. Among other things, UNIFI evaluates trends and uses the latest technology to create innovative specialty and PVA yarns that meet the needs of evolving consumer preferences.  Most of UNIFI’s branded yarns, including its flagship REPREVE® brand, were derived from its research and development initiatives.

UNIFI also includes, as part of its research and development initiatives, the use of continuous improvement methodologies to increase its manufacturing and other operational efficiencies, both to enhance product quality and to derive cost savings.  
 For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, UNIFI incurred $12,359, $7,792 and $7,177, respectively, in costs for research and development (including salaries and benefits of the personnel involved in those efforts). During fiscal 2019, in connection with consolidating and advancing our global innovation initiatives, certain employees moved from production roles to research and development.
 Intellectual Property
 UNIFI has numerous trademarks registered in the U.S. and in other countries and jurisdictions around the world.  Due to its current brand recognition and potential growth opportunities, UNIFI believes that its portfolio of registered REPREVE® trademarks is its most significant trademark asset.  Ownership rights in registered trademarks typically do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected under applicable law.
 UNIFI licenses certain trademarks, including Dacron® and Softec™, from Invista S.a.r.l. (“INVISTA”).
 UNIFI also employs its innovative manufacturing know-how, methods and processes to produce and deliver proprietary PVA solutions to customers and brand partners.  UNIFI relies on the copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect these rights.
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2019, UNIFI had approximately 2,860 employees, along with approximately 200 individuals working under temporary labor contracts.  The number of employees in the Polyester Segment, the Nylon Segment, the Brazil Segment, the Asia Segment and the corporate office were approximately 1,700, 500, 500, 60 and 100, respectively, at June 30, 2019.  While employees of UNIFI’s Brazilian operations are unionized, none of the labor force employed by UNIFI’s domestic or other foreign subsidiaries is currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  UNIFI believes that it has a good relationship with its employees.
Geographic Data
 Geographic information reported in conformance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) is included in Note 26, “Business Segment Information,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  Information regarding risks attendant to UNIFI’s foreign operations is included in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report.
Seasonality
 UNIFI is not significantly impacted by seasonality; however, UNIFI typically experiences its highest sales volumes in the fourth quarter of its fiscal years.  Excluding the effects of fiscal years with 53 weeks rather than 52 weeks, the most significant effects on UNIFI’s results of operations for particular periods during a year are due to planned manufacturing shutdowns by either UNIFI or its customers for certain holiday or traditional shutdown periods, which are not concentrated in any one particular quarter.
Backlog
 UNIFI’s level of unfilled orders is affected by many factors, including the timing of specific orders and the delivery time for specific products, as well as a customer’s ability or inability to cancel the related order.  As such, UNIFI does not consider the amount of unfilled orders, or backlog, to be a meaningful indicator of expected levels of future sales or to be material to an understanding of UNIFI’s business as a whole.
Working Capital
 UNIFI funds its working capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations, which it supplements with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
Inflation
 UNIFI expects costs to continue to rise for certain consumables used to produce and ship its products, as well as for its utilities and labor costs and benefits. While UNIFI attempts to mitigate the impacts of such rising costs through increased operational efficiencies and increased selling prices, inflation could become a factor that negatively impacts UNIFI’s profitability.
Environmental Matters
 UNIFI is subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations limiting the use, storage, handling, release, discharge and disposal of a variety of hazardous substances and wastes used in or resulting from its operations (and to potential remediation obligations thereunder).  These laws include the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (including provisions relating to underground storage tanks) and the Comprehensive Environmental

Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly referred to as “Superfund” or “CERCLA,” and various state counterparts to such laws.  UNIFI’s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations issued thereunder, which, among other things, establish exposure standards regarding hazardous materials and noise standards, and regulate the use of hazardous chemicals in the workplace.
 UNIFI believes that it has obtained, and is in compliance in all material respects with, all significant permits required to be issued by federal, state or local law in connection with the operation of its business.  UNIFI also believes that the operation of its production facilities and its disposal of waste materials are substantially in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and that there are no material ongoing or anticipated capital expenditures associated with environmental control facilities necessary to remain in compliance with such provisions.  UNIFI incurs normal operating costs associated with the discharge of materials into the environment, but does not believe that these costs are material or inconsistent with those of its domestic competitors.
 On September 30, 2004, Unifi Kinston, LLC (“UK”), a subsidiary of Unifi, Inc., completed its acquisition of polyester filament manufacturing assets located in Kinston, North Carolina from INVISTA.  The land for the Kinston site was leased pursuant to a 99-year ground lease (the “Ground Lease”) with E.I. DuPont de Nemours (“DuPont”).  Since 1993, DuPont has been investigating and cleaning up the Kinston site under the supervision of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (“DEQ”) pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action program.  The program requires DuPont to identify all potential areas of environmental concern (“AOCs”), assess the extent of containment at the identified AOCs and remediate the AOCs to comply with applicable regulatory standards.  Effective March 20, 2008, UK entered into a lease termination agreement associated with conveyance of certain assets at the Kinston site to DuPont.  This agreement terminated the Ground Lease and relieved UK of any future responsibility for environmental remediation, other than participation with DuPont, if so called upon, with regard to UK’s period of operation of the Kinston site, which was from 2004 to 2008.  At this time, UNIFI has no basis to determine if or when it will have any responsibility or obligation with respect to the AOCs or the extent of any potential liability for the same.
 UK continues to own property (the “Kentec site”) acquired in the 2004 transaction with INVISTA that has contamination from DuPont’s prior operations and is monitored by DEQ.  The Kentec site has been remediated by DuPont, and DuPont has received authority from DEQ to discontinue further remediation, other than natural attenuation.  Prior to transfer of responsibility to UK, DuPont and UK had a duty to monitor and report the environmental status of the Kentec site to DEQ. 
 Effective April 10, 2019, UK assumed sole remediator responsibility of the Kentec site pursuant to its contractual obligations with INVISTA and received $180 of net monitoring and reporting costs due from DuPont.  In connection with monitoring, UK expects to sample and report to DEQ annually. UNIFI expects no active site remediation will be required and has no basis to determine any costs that may be associated with active remediation. 
 Joint Ventures and Unconsolidated Affiliates
 In addition to its 34% ownership in PAL, UNIFI participates in two joint ventures that supply raw materials to the Nylon Segment, with one located in the U.S. and one in Israel.  As of June 30, 2019, UNIFI had $114,320 recorded for these investments in unconsolidated affiliates.  For fiscal 2019, $3,968 of UNIFI’s $10,011 of income before income taxes was generated from its investments in these unconsolidated affiliates, of which $2,561 was attributable to PAL.  Other information regarding UNIFI’s unconsolidated affiliates is provided in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Note 23, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities,” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
 On December 23, 2016, UNIFI, through a wholly owned foreign subsidiary, sold its 60% equity ownership interest in Repreve Renewables, LLC (“Renewables”), an entity that was focused on the development, production and commercialization of miscanthus grass for use in multiple potential markets, to its existing third-party joint venture partner for $500 in cash and release of certain debt obligations. UNIFI had no continuing involvement in the operations of Renewables subsequent to December 23, 2016. The corresponding results of Renewables, up through the date of sale, are reflected in continuing operations within the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
