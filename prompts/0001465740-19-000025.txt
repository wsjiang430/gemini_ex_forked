Item 1. Business
Overview
Our Company
Two Harbors Investment Corp. is a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing Agency residential mortgage-backed securities, or Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The terms “Two Harbors,” “we,” “our,” “us” and the “company” refer to Two Harbors Investment Corp. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity.
We were incorporated on May 21, 2009 and commenced operations as a publicly traded company on October 28, 2009, upon completion of a merger with Capitol Acquisition Corp., or Capitol, which became our wholly owned indirect subsidiary as a result of the merger. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol “TWO”.
Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following:

• | Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac);


• | Non-Agency securities that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;


• | MSR; and


• | Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio.

We seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We also finance our MSR through repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities.
We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act.
Our Manager 
We are externally managed and advised by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P, or Pine River. Pine River formed PRCM Advisers for the purpose of providing management services to us. PRCM Advisers is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers, PRCM Advisers provides us with our management team, including our executive officers and support personnel. In addition, PRCM Advisers provides us with the expertise of a dedicated team of investment professionals and other support. PRCM Advisers is at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors. Each of our executive officers is an employee or partner of Pine River; we do not have any employees. We do not pay any of our executive officers cash compensation; rather, we pay PRCM Advisers a base management fee equal to 1.5% per annum of our stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized net income, among other adjustments, as defined by the management agreement. We also reimburse PRCM Advisers for the allocable share of the compensation paid by Pine River to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and other reimbursable costs under the management agreement. We do not pay PRCM Advisers any incentive-based fees or other incentive-based compensation.

Through our relationship with PRCM Advisers, we benefit from Pine River’s disciplined and highly analytical investment approach and extensive long-term relationships in the financial community. Pine River’s disciplined investment process utilizes a cross-product approach, conducting top-down market assessments with respect to various subsets of the securities and mortgage market in order to identify the most attractive segments and investment opportunities. Our investment process leverages proprietary and third-party analytic tools to conduct a detailed analysis of factors that influence our target assets. We select our target assets after extensive analysis of the asset, including the underlying collateral, prepayment trends, average remaining life, amortization schedules, fixed versus floating interest rates, geographic concentration, property type, loan-to-value ratios and credit scores, among others. 
The dedicated team of investment professionals provided to us by PRCM Advisers has broad experience in managing our target assets and has demonstrated the ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns under different market conditions and cycles. Pine River maintains extensive long-term relationships with financial intermediaries, including prime brokers, investment banks, broker-dealers and asset custodians. We believe these relationships enhance our ability to source, finance, protect and hedge our investments and, thus, enable us to succeed in various credit and interest rate environments. We also benefit from Pine River’s risk management, accounting, operations, legal, compliance and information technology teams. Through the contribution of resources employed by Pine River who have significant experience in managing our target assets and the use of experienced outside advisors, we believe that we have sufficient experience to execute on our business strategies.

Our Business
Our Investment Strategy
Our investment objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long-term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We intend to achieve this objective by constructing a well-balanced portfolio consisting of Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, MSR and other financial assets, with a focus on managing various associated risks, including interest rate, prepayment, credit, mortgage spread and financing risk. The preservation of book value is of paramount importance to our ability to generate total return on an ongoing basis. Consistent with the objective of achieving attractive risk-adjusted total return over various market cycles, we intend to maintain a balanced approach to these various risks. 
We rely on PRCM Advisers’ expertise in identifying assets within our target asset classes. PRCM Advisers makes investment decisions based on a rigorous asset selection process that takes into consideration a variety of factors, including expected cash yield, risk-adjusted returns, current and projected credit fundamentals, current and projected macroeconomic considerations, current and projected supply and demand, credit and market risk concentration limits, liquidity, cost of financing and financing availability. It is our intention to select our assets in such a way as to maintain our REIT qualification and our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act.

Our Target Assets
Our portfolio can be categorized into two strategies based on investment characteristics, which embodies our hybrid investment approach. Both strategies are managed by our Chief Investment Officer and resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed on a consolidated basis. The categories and their respective target asset classes are as follows:

• | Rates Strategy - Includes Agency RMBS, MSR and related hedging transactions. The performance of this strategy is most affected by changes in interest rates, prepayments and mortgage spreads. These assets have minimal exposure to the underlying credit performance of the investments.


Agency RMBS | Agency RMBS collateralized by fixed rate mortgage loans, adjustable-rate mortgage (or ARM) loans or hybrid mortgage loans, or derivatives thereof, including: 
 | • | mortgage pass-through certificates; 
 | • | collateralized mortgage obligations; 
 | • | Freddie Mac gold certificates; 
 | • | Fannie Mae certificates; 
 | • | Ginnie Mae certificates; 
 | • | “to-be-announced” forward contracts, or TBAs, which are pools of mortgages with specific investment terms to be issued by government sponsored entities, or GSEs, at a future date; and
 | • | interest-only and inverse interest-only securities. 
MSR | The right to control the servicing of mortgage loans and receive the servicing income therefrom; the actual servicing functions are outsourced to appropriately licensed third-party subservicers, which service the loans in their own names.


• | Credit Strategy - Includes non-Agency securities and related hedging transactions. The performance of this strategy is most affected by changes in credit performance of the underlying collateral. These assets have interest rate and mortgage spread exposure, although such exposures are not viewed to be the main drivers of performance.


Non-Agency securities | Non-Agency securities collateralized by prime mortgage loans, Alt-A mortgage loans, pay-option ARM loans and subprime mortgage loans, which may have fixed rate, adjustable rate or hybrid rate terms. 
 | Non-Agency securities includes both senior and mezzanine securities. Senior refers to non-Agency securities that represent the senior-most tranches (that is, the tranches which have the highest priority claim to cash flows from the related collateral pool) within the securities’ structure. Mezzanine refers to subordinated tranches within the collateral pool. The non-Agency securities we purchase may include investment-grade and non-investment grade classes, including non-rated securities.
 | Hybrid mortgage loans have terms with interest rates that are fixed for a specified period of time and, thereafter, generally adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. ARMs refer to hybrid and adjustable-rate mortgage loans which typically have interest rates that adjust annually to an increment over a specified interest rate index. 

Other assets include financial and mortgage-related assets other than the target assets in our rates and credit strategies, including previously held commercial real estate assets, residential mortgage loans and certain non-hedging transactions that may produce non-qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests.
Our Investment Activities
The following is a summary of our investment activities related to the target assets in our rates and credit strategies for the year ended December 31, 2018. We believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation decisions factor in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, allocation among our target assets reflects management’s flexible approach to investing in the marketplace. 
 4

Rates Strategy
Our Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of “AAA,” or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities. 
One of our wholly owned subsidiaries holds the requisite approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to own and manage MSR, which represent a contractual right to service a mortgage loan and collect a fee for performing servicing activities, such as collecting principal and interest from a borrower and distributing those payments to the owner of the loan. We do not directly service the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with appropriately licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions in the name of the subservicer for the loans underlying our MSR.
We believe MSR are a natural fit for our portfolio over the long term. Our MSR business leverages our core competencies in prepayment and credit risk analytics and the MSR assets are a natural hedge to our Agency RMBS, hedging both interest rate and mortgage spread risk. Our goal is to create long-lasting relationships with high quality originators in both flow and bulk acquisitions of MSR. 
Credit Strategy
Within our non-Agency securities portfolio, we have a substantial emphasis on “legacy” securities, which consist of securities issued prior to 2009, many of which are subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve, as there remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. We also hold “new issue” non-Agency securities, which we believe have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency securities portfolio.
Our Investment Guidelines
Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines:

• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the 1940 Act;


• | we will primarily invest within our target assets, consisting primarily of Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, residential mortgage loans, MSR and commercial real estate assets, inclusive of commercial real estate loans, commercial real property, CMBS, commercial corporate debt and loans and other commercial real estate related investments in the U.S; approximately 5% to 10% of our portfolio may include other financial assets; and


• | until appropriate investments can be identified, we will invest available cash in interest-bearing and short-term investments that are consistent with (i) our intention to qualify as a REIT and (ii) our exemption from investment company status under the 1940 Act.

These investment guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors in its discretion without the approval of our stockholders.
Within the constraints of the foregoing investment guidelines, PRCM Advisers has broad authority to select, finance and manage our investment portfolio. As a general matter, our investment strategy is designed to enable us to:

• | build an investment portfolio consisting of Agency RMBS, non-Agency securities, MSR and other financial assets that will generate attractive returns while having a moderate risk profile;


• | manage financing, interest, prepayment rate, credit and similar risks;


• | capitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations in the mortgage and housing markets; and


• | provide regular quarterly dividend distributions to stockholders.

Within the requirements of the investment guidelines, PRCM Advisers makes determinations as to the percentage of our assets that will be invested in each of our target assets. Our investment decisions depend on prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different interest rate, economic and credit environments. As a result, we cannot predict the percentage of our assets that will be invested in any of our target asset classes at any given time. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio of assets and the flexibility of our strategy, combined with the expertise of PRCM Advisers and its affiliates, will enable us to achieve attractive risk-adjusted total return under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles.
 5

Financing Strategy
We deploy moderate leverage to increase potential returns to our stockholders and to fund the acquisition of our target assets. We are not required to maintain any particular leverage ratio. The amount of leverage we deploy for particular investments in our target assets depends upon a variety of factors, including without limitation: general economic, political and financial market conditions; the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets; the gap between the duration of assets and liabilities, including hedges; the availability and cost of financing the assets; our opinion of the credit worthiness of financing counterparties; the health of the U.S. residential mortgage and housing markets; our outlook for the level, slope and volatility of interest rates; the credit quality of the loans underlying our Agency and non-Agency securities; the rating assigned to securities; and our outlook for asset spreads relative to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, curve and benchmark rate curves.
Our primary financing sources for Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities are repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. Repurchase agreements are financings pursuant to which one party, the seller/borrower, sells assets to the repurchase agreement counterparty, the buyer/lender, for an agreed price with the obligation to repurchase the assets from the buyer at a future date and at a price higher than the original purchase price. The amount of financing available under a repurchase agreement is limited to a specified percentage of the estimated market value of the assets. The difference between the sale price and repurchase price is the interest expense of financing under a repurchase agreement. Under repurchase agreement financing arrangements, if the value of the collateral decreases, the buyer could require the seller to provide additional cash collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of borrowing (i.e., a margin call). In the current economic climate, lenders under repurchase agreements generally advance approximately 90% to 97% of the market value of the Agency RMBS financed (a discount from market value, generally referred to as a haircut, of 3% to 10%) and 50% to 75% of the market value of the non-Agency securities financed (i.e., a haircut of 25% to 50%).
To finance MSR, we enter into repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities collateralized by the value of the MSR pledged. If the value of our MSR pledged as collateral for the agreements decreases, the respective lender could require us to provide additional collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of the debt outstanding. Due to certain GSE requirements, we may be restricted as to the frequency in which we are able to pledge additional MSR collateral to counterparties. As a result, we may choose to over-collateralize certain repurchase agreements and revolving credit facilities in order to avoid having to provide cash as additional collateral. Lenders generally advance approximately 65% to 70% of the market value of the MSR financed (i.e., a haircut of 30% to 35%).
A significant decrease in the advance rate or an increase in the haircut could result in our having to sell assets in order to meet additional margin requirements by the lender. We expect to mitigate our risk of margin calls under repurchase agreements by deploying leverage at an amount that is below what could be used under current advance rates.
In order to reduce our exposure to risks associated with lender counterparty concentration, we generally seek to diversify our exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2018, we had $23.1 billion of outstanding balances under repurchase agreements with 30 counterparties, with a maximum net exposure (the difference between the amount loaned to us, including interest payable, and the value of the assets pledged by us as collateral, including accrued interest receivable on such assets) to any single lender of $342.7 million, or 8.1% of equity.
Our wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance currently has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities with a rating of A and above.
We use FHLB advances to finance our Agency and non-Agency securities. Similar to repurchase agreements, if the value of our assets pledged to the FHLB as collateral for advances decreases, the FHLB could require us to provide additional collateral to re-establish the ratio of value of the collateral to the amount of advances outstanding. The FHLB generally advances approximately 90% to 95% of the market value of the Agency RMBS financed (i.e., a haircut of 5% to 10%) and 85% to 90% of the market value of the non-Agency securities financed (i.e., a haircut of 10% to 15%).
In January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the ruling excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a membership grace period that runs through February 19, 2021, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited. However, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance’s outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets.

Interest Rate Hedging and Risk Management Strategy
We may enter into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments to economically hedge interest rate risk or “duration mismatch (or gap)” by adjusting the duration of our floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings to more closely match the duration of our assets. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (i.e., LIBOR) of certain derivatives match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related borrowing agreement from floating to fixed. The objective is to manage the cash flows associated with current and anticipated interest payments on borrowings, as well as the ability to roll or refinance borrowings at the desired amount by adjusting the duration. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on the value of our portfolio as well as our cash flows, we may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps and total return swaps. In executing on the Company’s current interest rate risk management strategy, the Company has entered into TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, interest rate swap, cap and swaption agreements and Markit IOS total return swaps. In addition, because MSR are negative duration assets, they provide a natural hedge to interest rate exposure on our Agency RMBS portfolio. In hedging interest rate risk, we seek to reduce the risk of losses on the value of our investments that may result from changes in interest rates in the broader markets, improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing.
Management Agreement 
Pursuant to the management agreement between us and PRCM Advisers, PRCM Advisers provides a dedicated team of investment and management professionals to carry out our business strategy as well as operational and administrative infrastructure to support our operations, subject to ongoing oversight by our board of directors. PRCM Advisers is responsible for, among other duties, (i) performing all of our day-to-day functions; (ii) determining investment criteria in conjunction with our board of directors; (iii) sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings; and (iv) performing asset management duties. 
The current term of the management agreement expires on October 28, 2019, and will continue to automatically renew thereafter for successive one-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the agreement. Our independent directors review PRCM Advisers’ performance annually and the management agreement may be terminated by us without cause upon the vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors or by a vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, based upon: (i) PRCM Advisers’ unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) our determination that the management fees payable to PRCM Advisers are not fair, subject to PRCM Advisers’ right to prevent termination based on unfair fees by accepting a reduction of management fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. We are required to provide PRCM Advisers with 180 days’ prior notice of such termination. Upon termination of the management agreement by us without cause or by PRCM Advisers due to our material breach of the management agreement, we are required to pay a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee earned by PRCM Advisers during the 24-month period immediately preceding the date of termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of termination. We may terminate the management agreement with 30 days’ prior notice from our board of directors, without payment of a termination fee, for cause, as defined in the management agreement. PRCM Advisers may terminate the management agreement if we become required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before such event, and may also decline to renew the management agreement by providing us with 180 days’ prior notice; in either case, we would not be required to pay a termination fee. 
Base Management Fee 
The base management fee paid to PRCM Advisers is 1.5% of our stockholders’ equity per annum, calculated and payable quarterly in arrears. 
For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders’ equity means the sum of the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus our retained earnings at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less the consolidated stockholders’ equity of Granite Point Mortgage Trust Inc., or Granite Point, during the time Granite Point was consolidated on our balance sheet (i.e. prior to spin off in 2017) the weighted average cost basis of Granite Point common stock purchased, the outstanding principal balance of the promissory note due from the sale of Granite Point preferred stock and any amount that we have paid for repurchases of our common stock since inception, and excluding any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized net income (regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income). In connection with the acquisition of CYS Investments, Inc., or CYS, in 2018, the management agreement was amended to (i) reduce PRCM Advisers’ base management fee with respect to the additional equity under management resulting from the merger to 0.75% from the effective time through the first anniversary of the effective time and (ii) for the fiscal quarter in which closing of the merger occured, to make a one-time downward adjustment of Pine River’s management fees payable by Two Harbors for such quarter by $15.0 million to offset the cash consideration payable to stockholders of CYS, plus an 
 7

additional downward adjustment of up to $3.3 million for certain transaction-related expenses. This amount will be adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, and certain non-cash items after discussions between PRCM Advisers and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. To the extent asset impairments reduce our retained earnings at the end of any completed calendar quarter it will reduce the base management fee for such quarter. Our stockholders’ equity for the purposes of calculating the base management fee could be greater than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown on the consolidated financial statements.
Expense Reimbursement
We reimburse PRCM Advisers for (i) our allocable share of the compensation paid by Pine River to its personnel serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel and personnel employed by Pine River as in-house legal, tax, accounting, consulting, auditing, administrative, information technology, valuation, computer programming and development, and back-office resources to us and (ii) any amounts for personnel of Pine River’s affiliates arising under a shared facilities and services agreement. We also have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for data services and technology, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us. 
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Our business is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations and securities exchanges. We are required to comply with numerous federal and state laws, including those described below. The laws, rules and regulations comprising this regulatory framework change frequently, as can the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations. Some of the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject are intended primarily to safeguard and protect consumers, rather than stockholders or creditors. From time to time, we may receive requests from U.S. federal and state agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our business activities. We incur significant ongoing costs to comply with these government regulations.
REIT Qualification
We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing with our taxable period ended December 31, 2009. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and value of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we conduct our operations in a manner which will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. Certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income that will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as TRSs to engage in such activities, and we may in the future form additional TRSs.
As long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the REIT taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we lost our REIT qualification. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property.
Investment Company Act of 1940
We conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. If we were to fall within the definition of an investment company, we would be unable to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that “is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.” Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act also defines an investment company as any issuer that “is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.” Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 
We are organized as a holding company that conducts business primarily through our subsidiaries. Any business conducted through our subsidiaries will be conducted in such a manner as to ensure that we do not meet the definition of “investment company” because less than 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis would consist of “investment securities.”

To avoid registration as an investment company, certain of our subsidiaries rely on certain exemptions from the 1940 Act, including Section 3(c)(5)(C), which exempts entities that are “primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” Under the SEC staff’s current guidance, to qualify for this exemption, we must maintain (i) at least 55% of our assets in qualifying interests (referred to as the 55% Test) and (ii) at least 80% of our assets in qualifying interest plus other real estate related assets (referred to as the 80% Test). Qualifying interests for this purpose include mortgage loans and other assets, such as whole pool Agency and non-Agency RMBS, which are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for the purposes of the 1940 Act. We expect each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to invest at least 55% of its assets in qualifying interests in accordance with SEC staff guidance, and an additional 25% of its assets in either qualifying interests or other types of real estate related assets that do not constitute qualifying interests. We believe that we conduct our business so that we are exempt from the 1940 Act under Section 3(c)(5)(C), but rapid changes in the values of our assets could disrupt prior efforts to conduct our business to meet the 55% Test and the 80% Test. Our efforts to comply with the 55% Test and the 80% Test could require us to acquire or dispose of certain assets at unfavorable prices and limit our ability to pursue certain investment opportunities.
The SEC has previously solicited public comment on issues relating to the exemptions set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including what types of assets should be deemed qualifying interests and whether REITs that invest in RMBS should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. Although we believe that we are properly relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act to exempt us from regulation under the 1940 Act, any modifications to the 1940 Act exemption rules or interpretations may require us to change our business and operations in order for us to continue to rely on such exemption. We will continue to monitor our compliance with the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemptions.
Mortgage Industry Regulation
Although we do not originate or service residential mortgage loans, we must comply with various federal and state laws, rules and regulations as a result of owning MSR. These rules generally focus on consumer protection and include, among others, rules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We are also required to maintain qualifications and licenses in certain states in order to own certain of our assets. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated or amended, or as regulatory guidance or interpretations evolve or change, and the trend in recent years among federal and state lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings in relation to the mortgage industry generally.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act imposes additional obligations on us to safeguard the information we maintain on mortgage loan borrowers, requires that we provide mortgage borrowers with notices describing how we collect, use and share their personal information, and allows mortgage borrowers to “opt-out” of sharing certain information with third parties and affiliates. In addition, certain states have passed a variety of laws to further protect borrower information, including laws that regulate the use and storage of personally identifiable information, require notifications to borrowers if the security of their personal information is breached, or require us to encrypt personal information when it is transmitted electronically. These federal and state laws require ongoing review and changes to our operations, increased compliance costs, and affect our ability to use and share information with third parties. 
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry, including the mortgage industry. The Dodd-Frank Act tasked many agencies with issuing a variety of new regulations, including rules related to mortgage origination, mortgage servicing, securitization transactions and derivatives.
 The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, which is responsible for regulating the offering and provision of financial products and services for personal, family and household purposes. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to the mortgage industry. In addition to its rulemaking authority, the CFPB has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services by certain non-depository institutions, including our company. 
The CFPB has issued a series of rules as part of ongoing efforts to affect reforms and create uniform standards for the mortgage lending and servicing industries. These rules include requirements addressing how lenders must evaluate a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan, what specific communications must be made to consumers at various stages in the mortgage lending and servicing processes, how consumer account records must be maintained and how servicers must respond to written borrower requests, complaints and notices of errors. The rules also provide specific guidance relating to servicing delinquent loans, undertaking loss mitigation efforts and commencing foreclosure proceedings. These rules have led to increased costs to originate and service loans across the mortgage industry, and given their complexity, it is anticipated the originators, servicers and other mortgage industry participants will be exposed to greater regulatory scrutiny from federal and state regulators and increased litigation and complaints from both consumers and government officials. We expect the CFPB will continue to interpret and modify the rules, regulations and guidance related to mortgage lending and servicing industries and we will continue to evaluate these actions in order to understand the impact on our business and the industry, generally.
We have implemented and will continue to implement new policies and procedures in order to ensure ongoing compliance with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business. We have incurred and expect to incur ongoing operational costs

to comply with existing and future rules and regulations. We continue to monitor and evaluate rulemaking and other developments regarding the Dodd-Frank Act.
Competition 
Our net income depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring our target assets, we compete with other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental agencies, mortgage loan servicers, asset management firms and other entities. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints that we are (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the 1940 Act). Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish different counterparty relationships than us. Further, we may from time to time face competition from government agencies in connection with initiatives designed to stimulate the U.S. economy or the mortgage market. Market conditions may from time to time attract more competitors for certain of our target assets, which will not only affect the supply of assets but may also increase the competition for sources of financing for these assets. An increase in the competition for sources of funding could adversely affect the availability and cost of financing, and thereby adversely affect our financial results.
