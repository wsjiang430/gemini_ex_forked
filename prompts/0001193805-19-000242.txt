Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Biglari Holdings Inc. is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities, including media, property and casualty insurance, and restaurants. The Company’s largest operating subsidiaries are involved in the franchising and operating of restaurants. Biglari Holdings is founded and led by Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Holdings and its major operating subsidiaries. The Company’s long-term objective is to maximize per-share intrinsic value. All major operating, investment, and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari.
 
As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Biglari’s beneficial ownership was approximately 56.9% of the Company’s outstanding Class A common stock and 54.3% of the Company’s outstanding Class B common stock.
 
Issuance of Dual Class Common Stock
 On March 5, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with its predecessor registrant, now known as OBH Inc. (the “Predecessor”), and BH Merger Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Pursuant to the agreement on April 30, 2018, BH Merger Company merged with and into the Predecessor, with the Predecessor continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
As a result of the April 30, 2018 transaction, the Company has two classes of common stock, designated Class A common stock and Class B common stock. A share of Class B common stock has economic rights equivalent to 1/5th of a share of Class A common stock; however, Class B common stock has no voting rights. Upon completion of the transaction, every ten (10) shares of common stock outstanding on April 30, 2018 converted into (i) ten (10) shares of Class B common stock and (ii) one (1) share of Class A common stock.
 
Since May 1, 2018, the shares of the Company’s Class A common stock have traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “BH.A” and the shares of the Company’s Class B common stock have traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “BH”.
 
Restaurant Operations
 The Company’s restaurant operations are conducted through two subsidiaries: Steak n Shake Inc. (“Steak n Shake”) and Western Sizzlin Corporation (“Western Sizzlin”). As of December 31, 2018, Steak n Shake had 413 company-operated restaurants and 213 franchise units. Western Sizzlin had 4 company-operated restaurants and 55 franchise units.
 
Steak n Shake is engaged in the ownership, operation, and franchising of Steak n Shake restaurants. Founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois, Steak n Shake is a classic American brand serving premium burgers and milkshakes. Steak n Shake is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
 
Western Sizzlin is engaged primarily in the franchising of restaurants. Founded in 1962 in Augusta, Georgia, Western Sizzlin offers signature steak dishes as well as other classic American menu items. Western Sizzlin also operates two other concepts: Great American Steak & Buffet, and Wood Grill Buffet. Western Sizzlin is headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia.
 
Operations
 A typical restaurant’s management team consists of a general manager, a restaurant manager and other managers depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. Each restaurant’s general manager has primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of his or her unit. Restaurant operations obtain food products and supplies from independent national distributors. Purchases are centrally negotiated to ensure uniformity in product quality.

Franchising
 Restaurant operations’ franchising program extends the brands to areas in which there are no current development plans for company stores. The expansion plans include seeking qualified new franchisees and expanding relationships with current franchisees. Restaurant operations typically seek franchisees with both the financial resources necessary to fund successful development and significant experience in the restaurant/retail business. Both restaurant chains assist franchisees with the development and ongoing operation of their restaurants. In addition, personnel assist franchisees with site selection, approve restaurant sites, and provide prototype plans, construction support and specifications. Restaurant operations’ staff provides both on-site and off-site instruction to franchise restaurant management and associates.
 
In addition to the traditional franchise arrangements described above, Steak n Shake initiated a new franchise partner program during 2018 to transition company-operated restaurants to such franchisees. The franchise agreement stipulates that the franchisee make an upfront investment totaling $10,000. Steak n Shake, as the franchisor, assesses a fee of up to 15% of sales as well as 50% of profits. Potential franchisees are screened based on entrepreneurial attitude and ability, but they become franchise partners based on achievement. Each must meet the gold standard in service. Franchise partners are required to be hands-on operators. We limit a franchisee to a single location.
 
International
 We have a corporate office in Monaco and an international organization with personnel in various functions to support our international business. As of December 31, 2018, we operated three company locations in Europe to promote the Steak n Shake brand to prospective franchisees. Similar to our traditional domestic franchise agreements, a typical international franchise development agreement includes development and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. As of December 31, 2018, there were a total of 29 franchise units in Europe and the Middle East.
Competition
 The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional and local establishments. There may be established competitors with financial and other resources that are greater than the Company’s restaurant operations capabilities. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, menu, food quality, location, and customer service. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants.
 
Government regulations
 The Company is subject to various global, federal, state and local laws affecting its restaurant operations. Each of the restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, i.e., health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Various federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees, e.g., minimum wage, overtime pay, unemployment tax, and workers’ compensation. Federal state and local government agencies have established or are in the process of establishing regulations requiring that we disclose nutritional information. To date, none of the Company’s restaurant operations have been materially adversely affected by such laws or been affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.
 
Trademark and licenses
 The name and reputation of Steak n Shake is a material asset and management protects it and other service marks through appropriate registrations.
 
Insurance Business
 Our insurance business is composed of First Guard Insurance Company and its agency, 1st Guard Corporation (collectively “First Guard”). First Guard is a direct underwriter of commercial truck insurance, selling physical damage and nontrucking liability insurance to truckers. First Guard is headquartered in Venice, Florida.
 
First Guard competes for truck insurance with other companies. The commercial truck insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized companies and by small regional insurers. First Guard’s insurance products are marketed primarily through direct response methods via the Internet or by telephone. First Guard’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods enable it to be a low-cost truck insurer. First Guard uses its own claim staff to manage claims. Seasonal variations in First Guard’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of claims.
 
The insurance business is stringently regulated by state insurance departments. First Guard operates under licenses issued by various insurance authorities. Such supervision and regulation include matters relating to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, licensing of insurers, investments, the filing of annual and other financial reports prepared on the basis of Statutory Accounting Principles, the filing and form of actuarial reports, dividends, and a variety of other financial and non-financial matters.

Media and Licensing Business
 Maxim’s business lies principally in media and licensing. Maxim is headquartered in New York City, New York.
 
Maxim competes for licensing business with other companies. The nature of the licensing business is predicated on projects that materialize with irregularity. In addition, publishing is a highly competitive business. The Company's magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the Internet and many other leisure-time activities. Competition for advertising dollars is based primarily on advertising rates, circulation levels, reader demographics, advertiser results, and sales team effectiveness.
 
Maxim products are marketed under various registered brand names, including, but not limited to, “MAXIM®” and “Maxim®”.
 
Investments
 The Company and its subsidiaries have invested in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P. (collectively, “the investment partnerships”).
