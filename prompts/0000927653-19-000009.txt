McKESSON CORPORATION

 Specialty Provider Organization: This business offers community specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, neurologists and other specialists) an extensive set of customizable products and services designed to strengthen core practice operations, enhance value-based care delivery and expand their service offering to patients. Tools and services include specialty drug distribution and group purchasing organization (“GPO”) services, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Vaccines for Children program. Community-based physicians in this business have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. This business also provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines and quality measurements to support U.S. Oncology Network, one of the nation’s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. We also support U.S. Oncology Research, one of the nation’s largest research networks, specializing in oncology clinical trials.
McKesson Life Sciences: This business helps life sciences companies accelerate the approval and successful commercialization of branded, specialty, generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals across the product life cycle. Our offerings to life sciences companies include specialty pharmacy services, third-party logistics (“3PL”), provider and patient engagement programs, clinical trial support, patient assistance programs, reimbursement services, analytics, and other tailored services. In addition, we help life sciences companies minimize reimbursement challenges while offering affordable, safe access to therapies through Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) programs. Our recent acquisitions of RxCrossroads and Biologics help expand our capabilities to support life sciences companies.
When we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.
European Pharmaceutical Solutions Segment:
Our European Pharmaceutical Solutions segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional and retail customers in 13 European countries where we own, partner or franchise with retail pharmacies, as further described below. The business consists of Pharmacy Solutions and Consumer Solutions.
Our Pharmacy Solutions business delivers pharmaceutical and other healthcare-related products to pharmacies across Europe.

Our more than 200,000 customers include physicians’ offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, home health agencies, and occupational and alternative health sites.

We develop customized plans to address the product, operational and clinical support needs of our customers, including tackling reimbursements, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We care for our customers, so they can care for their patients.
Other:
Other primarily consists of the following operating segments and business activities: McKesson Canada, MRxTS and our equity method investment in Change Healthcare.
McKesson Canada: This business is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers their products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a network of 15 distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers. Beyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation solutions to its retail and hospital customers.

Restructuring, Business Combinations, Investments, Divestitures and Discontinued Operations

These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, “Restructuring and Asset Impairment Charges,” “Business Combinations”, “Healthcare Technology Net Asset Exchange,” “Divestitures,” and “Discontinued Operations” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition
We face highly competitive global environments with strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies and large payer organizations.  In addition, we compete with other service providers, pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time-to-time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that would otherwise be provided by our businesses.  Our retail businesses also face competition from various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations, and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.
We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation. 
We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.
Other Information about the Business
Customers: During 2019, sales to our ten largest customers, including GPOs accounted for approximately 49.9% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 19.4% of our total consolidated revenues. In May 2019, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with CVS to June 2023. At March 31, 2019, trade accounts receivable from our ten largest customers were approximately 31.9% of total trade accounts receivable. Accounts receivable from CVS were approximately 18.4% of total trade accounts receivable. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment. 
Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than 6% of our purchases in 2019. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in 2019 accounted for approximately 42% of our purchases.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.
Research and Development: Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $71 million, $125 million and $341 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017. R&D expenses were lower in 2019 due to the sale of our Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business. R&D costs were lower in 2018 due to the 2017 contribution of the majority of our McKesson Technology Solutions businesses (“Core MTS Business”) to the Change Healthcare joint venture. 
Environmental Regulation: Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.
We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program.
We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are presently not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues, or to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2019 and is not expected to be material in the next year.
Employees: On March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 80,000 employees, including approximately 20,000 part-time employees.
Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations: Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations is included in Financial Note 28, “Segments of Business,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I below for information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations.
