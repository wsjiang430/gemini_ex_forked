Item 1. Business
Business Overview 
Over the recent past, Safeguard has provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of technology-driven businesses in healthcare, financial services and digital media. Throughout this document, we use the term “partner company” to generally refer to those companies in which we have a significant equity interest. In many, but not all cases, we will also be actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support, in addition to the influence we exert through our equity ownership. From time to time, in addition to these partner companies, we also hold relatively small equity interests in other enterprises where we do not exert significant influence and do not participate in management activities. In some cases, these interests relate to former partner companies.
In January 2018, Safeguard announced that we will not deploy any capital into new partner company opportunities and will focus on supporting our existing partner companies and maximizing monetization opportunities to return value to shareholders. In that context, we have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value. We anticipate returning value to shareholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs.
Safeguard's existing group of partner companies consist principally of technology-driven businesses in healthcare, financial services and digital media that are capitalizing on the next wave of enabling technologies, including enhanced security and predictive analytics. We strive to create long-term value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies to increase their market penetration, grow revenue and improve cash flow. Safeguard typically deploys up to $25 million in a company. 
In 2018, our management team focused on the following objectives:

• | Supporting our existing partner companies;


• | Building value in partner companies by developing strong management teams, growing the companies organically and through acquisitions, and positioning the companies for liquidity at premium valuations;


• | Realizing the value of partner companies through selective, well-timed exits to maximize risk-adjusted value;


• | Right-sizing our operating structure in light of our new structure; and


• | Addressing the liquidity needs of the Company.

To meet our strategic objectives during 2019, Safeguard will focus on:

• | Supporting our existing partner companies;


• | Helping our partner companies achieve additional market penetration, revenue growth, cash flow improvement and growth in long-term value; and


• | Pursuing monetization opportunities for our partner company interests.

We incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1953. Our corporate headquarters are located at 170 North Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 200, Radnor, Pennsylvania 19087.
Our Strategy 
Founded in 1953, Safeguard has a distinguished track record of building market leaders by providing capital and operational support to entrepreneurs across an evolving and innovative spectrum of industries. Over the recent past, Safeguard has provided capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of technology-driven businesses in healthcare, financial services and digital media. Safeguard's existing group of partner companies consist of companies that are capitalizing on the next wave of enabling technologies with a particular focus enhanced security and predictive analytics. Since January 2018, Safeguard began to implement a new business strategy designed to increase shareholder value. Under the new strategy, Safeguard ceased deploying capital into new partner companies. Safeguard remains focused on managing and financially supporting its existing partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to shareholders. 
Helping Our Partner Companies Build Value
We offer operational and management support to each of our partner companies through our domain expertise from our management team's careers as entrepreneurs, board members, financiers and operators. We provide hands-on assistance to the management teams of our partner companies to support their growth. 
Strategic Support. By helping our partner companies’ management teams remain focused on critical objectives through the provision of human, financial and strategic resources, we believe we are able to foster their development and success. We play an active role in developing the strategic direction of our partner companies, which include:

• | defining short and long-term strategic goals;


• | identifying and planning for the critical success factors to reach these goals;


• | identifying and addressing the challenges and operational improvements required to achieve the critical success factors and, ultimately, the strategic goals;


• | identifying and implementing the business measurements that we and others will apply to measure a company’s success; and


• | identifying sources of and providing capital to drive growth.

Management and Operational Support. We provide management and operational support, as well as ongoing planning and development assessment. Our executives serve on the boards of directors of our partner companies, working with them to develop and implement strategic and operating plans. We measure and monitor achievement of these plans through regular review of operational and financial performance measurements. We believe these services provide our partner companies with significant competitive advantages within their respective markets.
Realizing Value
 In January 2018, Safeguard began to implement a new business strategy designed to increase shareholder value. Under the new strategy, Safeguard ceased deploying capital into new partner companies. Safeguard remains focused on managing and financially supporting its existing partner companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities and maximizing the value returned to shareholders. We have, are and will consider initiatives including, among others: the sale of individual partner companies, the sale of certain or all partner company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value. We anticipate returning value to shareholders after satisfying our debt obligations and working capital needs. 
From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a partner company’s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our shareholders’ best interests, we will seek to sell some or all of our position in the partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the partner company’s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, sales of their securities in the open market. In the past, we have taken partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these (or 
4

similar) programs and the sale of certain partner company interests in secondary market transactions to maximize value for our shareholders. 
Given our recent change in strategy, the value of Safeguard is now virtually wholly dependent upon the value of our existing partner companies and our ability to translate that value into cash as efficiently as possible and to return that capital, net of our debt obligations and operating cash needs, to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and/or distributions to shareholders. As we have in the past, we will utilize the service of professional advisers from time to time to explore the various alternatives for returning capital to our balance sheet and ultimately to our shareholders. 
Our Partner Companies
An understanding of our partner companies is important to understanding Safeguard and its value-building strategy. Following are descriptions of our partner companies in which we own interests at February 25, 2019.
