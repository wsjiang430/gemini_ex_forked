Business
 
Nevada Canyon has a three-fold business model: (1) Exploration project accelerator; (2) mineral royalty acquisitions; and (3) precious-metals streaming.
 
● An exploration project accelerator means finding under-valued or distressed assets, providing initial investment capital for geological and exploration work, then selling the assets to other mining companies for premium returns without large capital expenditures. In this model, Nevada Canyon retains a royalty, recovers its costs, and avoids the high cost of putting mines into production. This can create short term upside value in these assets at very low risk while retaining a long-term royalty at a very low-cost basis. Nevada Canyon’s geological team discovers, interprets, and builds the geological models, then increases the land package through additional land acquisitions. The mineral resources are increased and upgraded, followed by the sale to larger mining companies.
 
● Nevada Canyon’s second business model is the acquisition of mineral property royalties (net smelter royalties or “NSR’s”). The Company plans to generate revenue from selling mineral properties to mining companies while retaining a long-term royalty for the life of the mine. This business model also includes the purchase of existing royalties from third parties as well as optioned sales of properties that provide ongoing revenue and eventual royalties. Nevada Canyon will stake and/or assemble drill-ready land packages for mining companies to explore and develop, then sell those claims while retaining a royalty. Nevada Canyon will also option exploration properties to mining or exploration companies for staged payments to the Company while retaining a royalty. Lastly, Nevada Canyon will also acquire royalties related to producing or near-term producing properties with close proximity to producing mines.
 
● The Company’s third business model is a precious-metals streaming company. A precious-metals streaming company provides up-front capital for mine development in exchange for a percentage of the precious metals output at a below-market cost, in some instances up to an 80% discount to market. Nevada Canyon can then sell what it receives from its partners at market prices and retain the difference as profit.
 
Nevada Canyon has identified numerous gold and silver streaming opportunities and is not tied to the performance of any one producer. Most importantly, streaming companies are instant beneficiaries of rising physical metal prices. For example, the average cash cost per gold equivalent ounce (“GEO”) is $400 for Nevada based on comparable operating streaming Companies. This offers investors cost predictability, direct leverage to increasing precious metals prices and in a high-quality asset base within Nevada. This portion of our business model offers investors commodity price leverage and exploration upside but with a much lower risk profile than a traditional mining company.
 
Nevada Canyon management (“Management”) has vast contacts within the mining industry and extensive experience in mineral property acquisitions and divestures with over 30 years-experience operating in Nevada. This enables us the unique ability to assemble valuable land packages near producing mines, which can then be sold to the mine operators while retaining a life-of-mine royalty. Nevada Canyon can generate near-term revenue through mineral property sales and generate long-term revenue through life-of-mine royalties. This strategy allows for the bypass of risk and the expense of exploration programs and/ or large production capital costs while keeping our overhead low.
 
We believe this multi-level business model is a significant improvement on the typical project generator/joint venture model. It allows the Company to maintain a large portfolio of properties and generate significant deal flow. Shareholder value is highly leveraged to the price of gold. As prices increase, we anticipate seeing growth in the value of our properties, the cash flow from our option portfolio, our equity investments in mid-tier/junior companies, and a higher market valuation on our growing royalty portfolio and the blue sky of our exploration programs. We also hope this revenue generating, low overhead type business model will also allow Nevada Canyon the ability to provide a potential dividend distribution to its shareholders.
 
As of the date of this Annual report on Form 10-K, our mineral property interests are comprised of the Lazy Claims Property, the Loman Property, and the Agai-Pah Property located in Mineral County, Nevada, the Swales Property located in Elko County, Nevada, and the Belshazzar Property located in Quartzburg mining district, Boise County, Idaho. In addition, we acquired a 2% net smelter returns royalty (“NSR”) on the Palmetto Project, located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, and have an option to acquire 100% interest of Target Minerals, Inc’s (“Target”) 1% production royalty on the Olinghouse Project, located in the Olinghouse Mining District, Washoe County, Nevada.

Lazy Claims Property
 
On August 2, 2017, we entered into an exploration lease agreement (the “Lazy Claims Agreement”) with Tarsis Resources US Inc. (“Tarsis”), a Nevada corporation, to lease rights to three Lazy claims totaling 60 acres (the “Lazy Claims”). The term of the Lazy Claims Agreement is ten years and is subject to extension for an additional two consecutive 10-year terms. Full consideration of the Lazy Claims Agreement consists of the following: an initial cash payment of $1,000 to Tarsis, which we paid upon the execution of the Lazy Claims Agreement, with $2,000 payable to Tarsis on each subsequent anniversary of the effective date. We agreed to pay Tarsis a 2% production royalty (the “Lazy Claims Royalty”) based on the gross returns from the production and sale of minerals from the Lazy Claims Property. Should the Lazy Claims Royalty payments to Tarsis be in excess of $2,000 per year, we will not be required to pay a $2,000 annual minimum payment. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we retain our leasing rights to the Lazy Claims.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Lazy Claims consist of three claims (60 acres) and are located within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. The Project is located in Mineral County, Nevada, with year-round access and established infrastructure, 18 miles southeast of Hawthorne, NV via U.S. Highway 95.
 
Geology
 
The US Geological Survey has mapped the area and has published the results as Miscellaneous Field Studies maps, MF 1485 and MF 1486. Mapped units include Paleozoic metasediments, Mesozoic sediments and intrusions, and Cenozoic volcanic rocks and porphyry intrusions. Like most of the Walker Lane, the area has a strong system of N50W- trending, normal and strike-slip faults along with a series of generally NE-trending thrust faults. The area has seen prospecting since the late 1800’s and contains hundreds of prospect pits and adits that explore various styles of base and precious metal mineralization.
 
The published USGS geologic quadrangle map for the Pamlico mine area, (MF 1485, MF 1486, Oldow, 1985), shows the eastern portion of the Lazy Claims project area underlain by a thick, undivided sequence of folded and faulted Mesozoic and or Paleozoic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The western portion of the project is underlain by Jurassic- to Triassic-age Sunrise and Gabbs Formations comprising interbedded limestones and calcareous mudstones. Locally, black Tertiary basalt caps the older rocks. The structural fabric is dominated by NW-trending, Walker Lane structures and by an older N70o E fabric, several phases of strongly altered and locally mineralized intrusive rocks as well as zones of jasperoids and strong silicification has been identified.
 
Mineralization
 
Previous work on the project has identified the following discrete zones of mineralization: (1) the Lazy Man gold zone which is a structurally-controlled, intrusion-related gold deposit that produced about 1,200 oz Au from NW-trending, high grade zones partially hosted by altered rhyolite dikes, (2) areas of strong vuggy silica alteration in both intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates particularly in the footwall of the Lazy Man zone, (3) a large area of barite and copper mineralization with intense bleaching east of the gold zone, (4) strong copper showings to the southeast of the gold zone, (5) the Loman antimony mine to the southwest of the gold zone, (6) skarn zones to the west of the gold zone, (7) a large zone of strong IP response to the west of the gold zone, and (8) a pyrrhotite porphyry intrusion west of the gold zone.

Exploration history
 
The Lazy Claims cover several past-producing small-scale high-grade mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings, discovered by the previous exploration on the Project. The previous sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher grade gold. Previous induced polarization surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. anomalies. Below is a summary of previous exploration of identified mineralized areas within the properties.
 
Lazy Man Mine
 
The main structure that the mine workings explore has an N35oW trend and dips about 60o to the southwest. The vein was discovered in 1933 by a local prospector. The mine is credited with historic production of about 1,200 ounces of gold from 2,800 feet (853 m) of underground workings. The three main shafts explore about 1,000 feet (304 m) of strike length on the vein, and the shafts extend to a maximum depth of 300 feet (91 m). The workings have been mapped and sampled in some detail by Congdon and Carey in 1974, and many multi-ounce gold values are noted in the remaining vein material. One 4.9 foot-long (1.5 m) sample from a cross cut on the 300 level contained 2.2 oz Au/ton (68.4g/t). The high-grade veins occur within a broader zone of intense quartz-sericite alteration, which has previously been mapped as rhyolite. Most of the mine dumps are composed of this “rhyolite”, and Congdon and Carey measured approximately 8,000 tons of this material containing from 0.09 to 0.21 oz Au/ton (3.07 to 7.1 g/t Au). Gold occurs in iron oxide-filled fractures along with druzy quartz veinlets, and there is occasionally visible gold. Detailed mapping around the old workings of the Lazy Man mine has delineated a zone of intense acid-leaching in intrusive porphyritic rocks and volcanic agglomerates primarily in the footwall of the vein. The rock now has a porous and vuggy appearance; this style of alteration is interpreted to be “Vuggy Silica” alteration that is typical of the upper levels of high-sulfidation ore deposits. Surrounding the vuggy silica zone is a zone of strong argillic alteration. Recent work has discovered previously unrecognized mineralized zones east of and parallel to the Lazy Man vein that contain silicified, brecciated outcrops assaying 2.26 g/t Au and 8,150 ppm As. These zones have been traced for over 1,200 feet (365 m) and are up to 60 feet (18 m) wide.
 
Exploration program
 
In 2020 we completed a portion of the Phase I exploration program on the Lazy Claims Property, which consisted of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, and relocating historical workings. Completion of the Phase I program was initially scheduled for spring of 2021, however, due to the continued restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic, the phase was put on hold. The Company intends to resume Phase I later in 2023. Phase I program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the Phase II drill program.
 
Loman Property
 
In December 2019 we acquired 27 unpatented mining claims for a total of $10,395 (the “Loman Property”). Due to certain regulatory restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was required to delay the re-registration of the Loman Property claims into the Company’s name. The Loman claims were transferred and re-registered into the Company’s name in the fourth quarter of the fiscal 2021.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Loman Property is located in Mineral County, Nevada, within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada, located 20 miles southeast of Hawthorne, Nevada, along U.S. Highway 95. The project has excellent year-round access and infrastructure within Mineral County, one of the most pro-mining counties and highest-grade gold districts of Nevada.
 
The Loman Property consists of 27 unpatented mining claims having a combined area of approximately 540 acres. The Loman Property covers several past producing small-scale high-grade gold and copper mines, altered and mineralized zones discovered by previous geological compilations and mapping of the historical workings. Historical sampling on the project has revealed the presence of copper, bismuth, and antimony as well as pervasive lower grade gold mineralization, cut by vein structures (some previously mined) of higher-grade gold. Previous geophysical surveys also denoted the presence of significant coincident I.P. and magnetic anomalies. These factors clearly demonstrate the potential of this relatively unexplored project for the discovery of gold mineralization.
 
The Loman Property is located near several past producing mines including the Bodie, Aurora, Borealis, Pamlico, Evening Star, Mabel, Mindoro and Camp Douglas Mines. Held by private interests for most of its history, the Loman Property remains very underexplored with a potential for new discoveries on several exploration targets with multiple zones.

Exploration program
 
In 2020 we completed a portion of our Phase I program that consisted of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, relocating historical workings and ground based geophysical surveying. Completion of the Phase I program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the Phase II drill program. Phase I was initially expected continue in the spring 2021, with Phase II to begin shortly after the compilation of the Phase I results. Due to the restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic, Phase I was put on hold and the Company plans to resume it later in 2023.
 
Agai-Pah Property
 
On May 19, 2021, we entered into an exploration lease with option to purchase agreement (the “Agai-Pah Property Agreement”) with MSM Resource, L.L.C., (“MSM”) a Nevada limited liability Corporation on the Agai-Pah Property, consisting of 20 unpatented mining claims totaling 400 acres (the “Agai-Pah Property”). Alan Day, the managing member of MSM, is a director of the Company and a related party.
 
The term of the Agai-Pah Property Agreement commenced on May 19, 2021, and continues for ten years, subject to the Company’s right to extend the Agai-Pah Property Agreement for two additional terms of ten years each, and subject to the Company’s option to purchase the Property.
 
Full consideration of the Agai-Pah Property Agreement consists of the following: (i) an initial cash payment of $20,000 to be paid within 90 days from the execution of the Agai-Pah Property Agreement on May 19, 2021 (the “Effective Date”), and (ii) annual payments of $20,000 to be paid on the anniversary of the Effective Date while the Agai-Pah Property Agreement remains in effect.
 
The Company has the exclusive option and right to acquire 100% ownership of the Agai-Pah Property (the “Agai-Pah Purchase Option”). To exercise the Agai-Pah Purchase Option, the Company will be required to pay $750,000 (the “Agai-Pah Purchase Price”). The Agai-Pah Purchase Price can be paid in either cash and/or equity of the Company, or a combination thereof, at the election of MSM. The annual payments paid by the Company to MSM, shall not be applied or credited against the Purchase Price. The Company made the initial cash payment of $20,000 on November 6, 2021, pursuant to a verbal extension granted to the Company by MSM, and made the first $20,000 anniversary payment on June 20, 2022.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Agai-Pah Property consists of 20 unpatented mining claims with a combined area of 162 hectares (400 acres). The Property is located in the northwestern portion of the Gillis Range, within the Buckley Mining District, in Mineral County, Nevada, 13 miles north-east of the town of Hawthorne, and 22 miles SW of the Rawhide Mine. The Property is within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60-mile-wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. The project has excellent year-round access and infrastructure within Mineral County, Nevada.
 
Geology and Mineralization
 
The property is underlain by meta-volcanic rocks of the Permo-Triassic Excelsior Formation. The local stratigraphy consists of interbedded volcanics, conglomerate and occasional limestone lenses that have been altered through metamorphisim to hornfelsic greenstones and localized calcsilicate and marble skarns. The area is cross-cut by a large northwest to southeast structural trend, with the mineralization occurring along this trend and along skarn contacts.
 
Mineralization occurs as hydrothermal alteration and veining along structures and along contacts with carbonate rocks. Silver, lead, copper and gold are found within clay altered shears, quartz veins and hornfeslic scarns. In the west central portion of the property, a quartz vein is exposed within a small open pit which exhibits visible chlorargyrite (AgCl) with assay values to 1.76% silver.

Exploration history
 
The Agai-Pah property contains numerous historical workings consisting of underground workings with multi-level vertical shafts, several adits at different sub-levels, declines and a number of prospects pits that dig along structures. An existing road network provide access to the numerous historical workings. Historical sampling on the project has revealed the presence of silver, copper, gold, lead, zinc, barium and barite. There have been at least two periods of mining on the property, with the first in the early 1900’s, and then later in the late 1980’s. The early 1900’s, work consisted of excavation of at least 15 adits, 5 vertical shafts, declines and numerous prospects pits that dig along structures.
 
The second episode of mining took place in the late 1980s when a small pit was excavated, and ore material was mined and transported approximately 2 miles to the west to a small heap leach. During this time about two kilometers of roads were built, several large trenches were completed, and a number of shallow drill holes (12+) were drilled. All the drill holes noted during this historical work were vertical and most were drilled in the hanging wall of the ore-bearing structures. An extensive sampling program was undertaken in early 1988, evidenced by aluminum sample tags widely spaced in the areas of alteration. No historical data has been found from any of this historical exploration work.
 
Exploration program
 
Due to the restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has yet to start any exploration activities on the Agai-Pah Property. The Company plans to start with Phase I exploration program later in 2023. Phase I of the exploration program on the Agai-Pah Property, will consist of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, and relocating historical workings. Once completed, the Phase I program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the Phase II exploration program. Phase II will consist of a ground-based geophysical survey and final compilation of all the Phase I results.
 
Belshazzar Property
 
On June 4, 2021, we entered into an exploration lease with option to purchase agreement (the “Belshazzar Property Agreement”) with Belshazzar Holdings, L.L.C., (“BH”) a Nevada limited liability Corporation on the Belshazzar Property, consisting of ten unpatented lode mining claims and seven unpatented placer mineral claim totaling 200 acres (the “Belshazzar Property”). Alan Day, the managing member of BH, is a director of the Company and a related party.
 
The term of the Belshazzar Property Agreement commenced on June 4, 2021, and continues for ten years, subject to the Company’s right to extend the Belshazzar Property Agreement for two additional terms of ten years each, and subject to the Company’s option to purchase the Belshazzar Property.
 
Full consideration of the Belshazzar Property Agreement consists of the following: (i) an initial cash payment of $20,000 to be paid within 90 days from the execution of the Belshazzar Property Agreement on June 4, 2021 (the “effective date”), and (ii) annual payments of $20,000 to be paid on the anniversary of the Effective Date while the Belshazzar Property Agreement remains in effect.
 
The Company has the exclusive option and right to acquire 100% ownership of the Belshazzar Property (the “Belshazzar Purchase Option”). To exercise the Belshazzar Purchase Option, the Company will be required to pay $800,000 (the “Belshazzar Purchase Price”). The Belshazzar Purchase Price can be paid in either cash and/or equity of the Company, or a combination thereof, at the election of BH. The annual payments paid by the Company to BH, shall not be applied or credited against the Belshazzar Purchase Price. The Belshazzar Property is subject to a 1% Gross Returns Royalty payable to the property owner, from the commencement of commercial production subject to certain terms. The Company made the initial cash payment of $20,000 on November 6, 2021, pursuant to a verbal extension granted to the Company by BH, and made the first $20,000 anniversary payment on June 20, 2022.

Location and means of access
 
The Belshazzar Property consists of 10 unpatented mineral claims and 7 placer mineral claims in a combined area of approximately 200 acres situated along the upper reaches of Fall Creek within the Quartzburg mining district. The Belshazzar Property is accessed via 16 miles of mostly gravel road from Idaho City, with year-round access. The Quartzburg district is in the western part of a larger mining region known as the Boise Basin, which produced over 2.8 million troy ounces of gold from placer and lode mines (Anderson, 1947).
 
Geology and Mineralization
 
The Boise Basin is underlain by Cretaceous-age plutonic rocks of the Idaho Batholith, consisting chiefly of biotite granodiorite and muscovite-biotite granite. Stocks of platonic rocks of Eocene age, including diorite, quartz monzodiorite, hornblende-biotite granodiorite, gabbro and biotite granite have intruded into the Idaho Batholith.
 
The Belshazzar and Mountain Chief mines are situated at opposite ends of a northeast-striking, mineralized shear zone in Cretaceous biotite granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. Three roughly parallel fissure veins have been identified within this shear zone, with the Belshazzar being the central and most prominent. The Centennial vein lies 680 feet to the south and has received only a limited amount of underground development work from the Belshazzar mine. A third vein is located approximately 600 feet to the north of the Belshazzar vein and has seen only limited prospecting from the surface.
 
Exploration history
 
The Belshazzar Property hosts the past producing Belshazzar mine. Approximately 3,000 feet of underground workings consisting of several adits at different levels, sub-levels with connecting vertical shafts and milling facilities. By 1914, the Belshazzar mine had its own boarding house, bunk house, barn, assay office, blacksmith shops, sawmill and IO-stamp mill. Construction of a new mill was completed in 1924. A 1,700-foot-long aerial tramway connected ore bins at the No. 2 portal with the mill on Fall Creek (Quinn, 1914) remains of a tram terminal can still be seen at the No. 2 portal and at the site of the original mill (Dan Turmes, Idaho Dept. of Environmental Quality, 2008) The last known production from the Belshazzar mine was reported in 1941 (Mitchell, 2008). Exact production figures for the mine are not available.
 
As early as 1914, “high grade specimen rock” was being reported from the Belshazzar mine (Quinn 1914), this material was found in the drift on the No. 3 level. A reported (Campbell,1927) “nugget” which yielded $245 in gold, equivalent at the time to almost 12 ounces. During 1928, it was noted that “some remark ably rich segregations of native gold” had been found in a section of the vein between the 401 and No. 3 levels. Several hand-sorted lots of this material contained between 48 and 435 ounces of gold, and one single specimen of pure metal reportedly weighed 105 ounces (Mitchell, 2008). Some of the ore was so rich that it was shipped directly to the assay office in Boise without treatment. Most of the specimen gold found at the Belshazzar was probably melted down, as few specimens are known to have survived from the active mining period ending in 1931.
 
In recent years, a “ waste” rock dump located near the portal of the mine’s 401-foot level has, with the aid of modern metal detectors, produced hundreds of wire gold specimens, ranging from microscopic in size to over 20 troy ounces. Total recent gold specimen production to-date is unknown but is probably well in excess of 800 ounces of gold
 
Exploration program
 
Due to the restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has yet to start any exploration activities on the Belshazzar Property. The Company plans to start with Phase I exploration program later in 2023. Phase I of the exploration program on the Belshazzar Property, will consist of reconnaissance prospecting, geological mapping, surface trenching, and relocating historical workings. Once completed, the Phase I program will provide accurate modern data to assist in the planning of the Phase II exploration program. Phase II will consist of a ground-based geophysical survey and final compilation of all the Phase I results.

Swales Property
 
On December 27, 2021, we entered into an exploration lease with option to purchase agreement (the “Swales Property Agreement”) with Mr. W. Wright Parks III., (“Mr. Parks”) on the Swales Property, consisting of 40 unpatented lode mining claims totaling 800 acres (the “Swales Property”).
 
The term of the Agreement commenced on December 27, 2021, and continues for ten years, subject to the Company’s right to extend the Swales Property Agreement for two additional terms of ten years each, and subject to the Company’s option to purchase the Swales Property.
 
Full consideration of the Swales Property Agreement consists of the following: (i) an initial cash payment of $20,000 to be paid within 90 days from the execution of the Belshazzar Agreement on December 27, 2021 (the “effective date”), and (ii) annual payments of $20,000 to be paid on the anniversary of the Effective Date while the Swales Property Agreement remains in effect.
 
The Company has the exclusive option and right to acquire 100% ownership of the Swales Property (the “Swales Purchase Option”). To exercise the Swales Purchase Option, the Company will be required to pay $750,000 (the “Swales Purchase Price”). The Swales Purchase Price can be paid in either cash and/or equity of the Company, or a combination thereof, at the election of Mr. Parks. The annual payments paid by the Company to Mr. Parks, shall not be applied or credited against the Swales Purchase Price. The Company made the initial cash payment of $20,000 on January 15, 2022, and accrued $20,000 which were payable on the first anniversary of the Swales Property Agreement. The Company made the first anniversary payment on March 14, 2023.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Swales Property consists of 40 unpatented mining claims with a combined area of 800 acres. The Swales Property is located within the Carlin Trend, one of the richest mining districts in the world, and home to some of the largest gold mines in the US. The property is approximately 13 miles northeast of Nevada Gold Mine’s Gold Quarry Mine and 16 miles east southeast of Nevada Gold Mine’s Goldstrike Mine, all of which are located along the gold rich Carlin Trend. There are currently eight producing gold mines within the Carlin Trend. Collectively, these mines have to date produced over 100 million ounces of gold (Nevada Bureau of Mines 2019) and still contain more than 21 million ounces of gold reserves (Nevada Gold Mines, LLC Carlin Complex 2020). The Swales Property has excellent year-round access and infrastructure within Elko County, one of the most pro-mining counties in the pro-mining states and highest-grade gold districts of Nevada.
 
Geology and Mineralization
 
Geologically, the Swales Property is underlain by Upper plate Ordovician Vinini Formation (upper plate of the Roberts Mountains thrust) with windows of Lower plate Mississippian to Silurian Roberts Mountains Formation limestone (Lower plate of Roberts Mountains thrust), the ideal host rocks for a Carlin type gold deposit. These rocks have been intruded by Tertiary rocks identified as Monzonite porphyry to the west of the property with many prospects and historic mining. Much of the property is covered by alluvium, but silicified, iron stained jasperoids are found throughout the property where outcrops are exposed. Small gold anomalies occur in the upper plate rocks at Swales Mountain which suggests the possibility of more extensive deposits in the Roberts Mountains Formation where it lies concealed by gravels or in the broken rock within the Roberts Mountains thrust.
 
Exploration history
 
The Swales Property contains numerous historical workings consisting of prospects pits that dig along structures found throughout the property where outcrops are exposed. The Swales Property is located within the Carlin Trend, one of the richest mining districts in the world, and home to some of the largest gold mines in the USA. There are currently eight producing gold mines within the Carlin Trend. Collectively, these mines have to date produced over 100 million ounces of gold (Nevada Bureau of Mines 2019) and still contain more than 21 million ounces of gold reserves. (Nevada Gold Mines, LLC Carlin Complex 2020) The Swales Property has excellent year-round access and infrastructure within Elko County, one of the most pro-mining counties in the pro-mining states and highest-grade gold districts of Nevada.

Olinghouse Project
 
On December 17, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Canyon, LLC, entered into an Option to Purchase Agreement (the “Olinghouse Agreement”) with Target Minerals, Inc (“Target”), to acquire 100% interest of Target’s 1% production royalty on the Olinghouse Project.
 
The Company has the exclusive right and option (the “Olinghouse Purchase Option”), exercisable at any time during the Olinghouse Option Period, as further defined below, at its sole discretion, to acquire 100% of a 1% production royalty from the net smelter returns on all minerals and products produced from certain properties comprising the Olinghouse Project.
 
The term of the Olinghouse Purchase Option shall be the later of one year, or 60 days after the date on which the Company delivers to Target a written notice to exercise the Olinghouse Purchase Option, subject to further extension if Target’s conditions to closing are not fully satisfied or otherwise waived by the Company. Full consideration of the Olinghouse Agreement consists of the following: (i) an initial cash option payment of $200,000 payable upon execution of the Agreement, which the Company paid on December 18, 2021, and (ii) purchase price (the “Olinghouse Purchase Price”) which shall be paid by the Company to Target in either cash or common shares of the Company, the determination of which shall be as follows:
 

● | if the Company’s 10-day volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) Calculation is less than $1.25 per share, the Olinghouse Purchase Price shall be paid in cash; or 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | if the Company’s 10-day VWAP Calculation is more than $1.25 per share, the Olinghouse Purchase Price shall be paid in the form of 2,000,000 Shares of the Company’s common stock. 

 
On December 23, 2022, the Company and Target agreed to extend the Olinghouse Purchase Option for an additional one-year term, expiring on December 17, 2023, for a one-time cash payment of $40,000.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Olinghouse Project is located approximately 30 miles east of Reno, Nevada in the Olinghouse mining district. The project has excellent year-round access via state roads with existing infrastructures in place.
 
Exploration history
 
The Olinghouse property was operated by Alta Gold in the late 1990’s and had a Feasibility Study completed in 1997. The mine went into production in 1999, however, due to historically low gold prices combined with a substantial debt load, Alta Gold went bankrupt shortly thereafter, in late 2000.

The historic geologic resource as outlined in the above table is from the 1997 Alta Gold Feasibility Study based on over 600 drill holes collared at 100 ft centers. The historic geologic resource contained 18,244,830 tons (695,128 ounces) of gold at an average grade of 0.0381 oz/ton gold at an 0.01 oz/ton cut-off. The Olinghouse Project has had no modern exploration since the Alta Gold bankruptcy in 2000. The historical mineralized resource is open at depth and along strike, with excellent potential to increase the historical mineralized resources.
 
Nevada Canyon considers this historical estimate to be reliable and relevant, however it is not treating this historic estimate as current compliant mineral resources.
 
The Olinghouse Project’s current owner is Lake Mountain Mining LLC (“LMM”), a private Nevada company. LMM is currently reviewing its financing plans for additional exploration, required permitting, economic studies and various capital expenditures towards a production re-start decision in the near future.
 
Palmetto Project
 
On January 27, 2022, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Nevada Canyon, LLC, entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”) with Smooth Rock Ventures, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Smooth Rock Ventures Corp. (“Smooth Rock”), to acquire a 2% net smelter returns royalty (“NSR”) on the Palmetto Project (the “Palmetto Project”), located in Esmeralda County, Nevada. Alan Day, the Company’s director, is also a director and CEO of Smooth Rock.
 
To acquire the 2% NSR on the Palmetto Project, Nevada Canyon agreed to pay Smooth Rock a one-time cash payment of $350,000, which was paid on February 7, 2022.
 
Location and means of access
 
The Palmetto Project, consists of 116 unpatented mining claims totaling 2,217 acres located in Esmeralda County, Nevada, within the southern portion of the Walker Lane gold trend.
 
Exploration history
 
The Palmetto Project’s owner, Smooth Rock Ventures Corp (“Smooth Rock”), engaged WSP Canada Inc. to complete a current resource estimation of the Palmetto Project (Palmetto Resource Estimation and Technical Report, McCracken, October 20, 2020) using drill data up to October 2017 and applying certain economic constraints. The current mineral resource statement was updated by WSP to reflect a change in gold pricing and an adjustment in the mining costs in the generation of the constraining pit shells.
 
The table below summarizes the pit constrained resource estimation at the 0.15 g/t gold cut-off and remaining underground resource estimation at the 2.0 g/t gold cut-off.
 

Classification | Tonnes (000’s) | | Au g/t | | Ag g/t | Au oz. | Ag oz. | 
---------------+----------------+-------+--------+------+--------+--------+--------+--------
Inferred (Pit) | | 9,397 | | 0.93 | | 6.38 | | 281,581 | 1,926,652
Inferred (U/G) | | 170 | | 2.76 | | 17.51 | | 11,114 | 95,926 
Total inferred | | 9,567 | | 0.96 | | 6.58 | | 296,695 | 2,022,578

 
The above mineral resource estimation was completed using NI 43-101 standards of practice and classified as an inferred resource.
 
The Palmetto Project has had significant exploration work completed to date by Newmont Gold, Phelps Dodge Corp, Cambior Inc., Romarco Minerals, Curran Corp., Amselco Minerals, Escape Gold Group Inc., and most recently by ML Gold Corp. To date, 173 drill holes totaling 43,940 meters have been completed on several targets within the Palmetto Project. The initial “Discovery Hole” was drilled by Phelps Dodge in 1988, and bonanza gold-silver veins were subsequently drilled by Romarco Minerals in 1997-2002.

There are several additional mineralized zones hosting significant grades within close proximity to the inferred resource zones. These zones have yet to be included in the resource estimate due to drilling density. Smooth Rock sees these areas having immediate potential to significantly increase the overall resource on the Palmetto Project by increasing the drilling density between mineralized shells. Evidence suggests that there is significant potential to expand the resource in multiple directions.
 
Exploration program
 
On February 22, 2021, Smooth Rock commenced an initial four-hole diamond drill program. The program was designed to expand the current resource by drilling the mineralized zones laterally and at depth, to extend the present known mineralization. Drilling also targeted the high-grade feeder chutes contained in deformation corridors, paralleling the main structural trends, and explored other areas of the Palmetto project outside of the inferred resource area.
 
Highlights included drill hole SRV 21-01 returning 31.4 g/t Au over 6.5 meters, including 44.3g/t Au over 0.8 meters, and 122.5 g/t Au over 1.1 meters from a depth of approximately 85 meters. Drill hole SRV 21-02 returned 1.73 g/t Au over 2.8 meters, at a depth starting at 102.4 meters.
 
The 2021 drill results align with Smooth Rock’s interpreted geological model, based on the compilation of all historical data from previous drilling and exploration programs. The information from the compilation and interpretation of the 2021 drill program greatly aided in acceleration of drilling, geological mapping and understanding of the gold mineralization at the Palmetto Project.
 
In May 2022, Smooth Rock began a drill program, which was designed to expand the current resource by extending the known mineralized zones laterally and at depth. Drilling targeted the high-grade feeder chutes and explored other areas of the project outside of the inferred resource area. The drill program was hampered by drill rig breakdowns, extensive technical drilling issues with ground water, loose broken ground, and the inability of the drill crew to successfully mud any of the holes in order to reach the drill holes’ targeted depths. A total of seven holes were drilled, with none of the seven holes achieving their targeted depths, two of the seven holes drilled were abandoned before hitting bedrock. Consequently, the Smooth Rock ended the drill program early with only a total drilled footage of 2,095 feet (638.5m) of a planned 5,000-7,500-foot drill program.
 
Highlight of the 2022 drill program included the drill hole SRV 22-09, which returned 10.98 g/t Au over 9.2 meters, from a depth of 88.4 meters, including 18.87 g/t Au over 4.6 meters, from a depth of 89.9 meters. This drill hole was drilled over 32 meters west northwest of drill hole SRV 21-01, demonstrating the continuity and flat lying nature of the gold mineralization.
 
Smooth Rock is planning a follow up drill program in early 2023, subject to drill contractor availability.
 
Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters, and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
Raw Materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries, and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
Dependence on Customers
 
As a junior exploration company, we have no customers.

Trademarks and Patents
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks and, other than the obligations under the exploration lease agreement with Tarsis Resources US Inc. and the Royalty Agreement with Smooth Rock, no royalty agreements or labor contracts.
Need for Any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
Our exploration activities on our exploration projects may require permits from the BLM and several other governmental agencies. We may be unable to obtain these permits in a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration of our exploration claims will be adversely affected. Furthermore, the mining business is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit, however, we must ensure timely repair of any damage done to the land during exploration.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations on the Lazy Claims Property and on the Loman Property.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any money on research and development activities.
 
Employees
 
At the present time, we do not have any employees other than our sole officer who devotes his time as needed to our business and expects to continue devoting approximately 10 hours per week in 2023.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. Neither our sole officer nor our directors are party to any legal proceeding or litigation. None of our directors or our sole officer has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor relating to securities or performance in corporate office.
