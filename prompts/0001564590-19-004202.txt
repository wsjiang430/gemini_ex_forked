Item 1. Business. 
Company and Organization
 TPG RE Finance Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that was incorporated on October 24, 2014 and which commenced operations on December 18, 2014. We are externally managed by TPG RE Finance Trust Management, L.P., an affiliate of TPG. Our principal executive offices are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, 35th Floor, New York, New York 10106. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our various subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, the Company conducted substantially all of its operations through a Delaware limited liability company, TPG RE Finance Trust Holdco, LLC (“Holdco”), and the Company’s other wholly-owned subsidiaries.
 We conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain an exemption or exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act. We operate our business as one segment, which directly originates and acquires a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate-related assets consisting primarily of first mortgage loans and senior participation interests in first mortgage loans secured by institutional-quality properties in primary and select secondary markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”).
 Manager
 We are externally managed and advised by our Manager, which is responsible for administering our business activities, day-to-day operations, and providing us the services of our executive management team, investment team, and appropriate support personnel. TPG Real Estate, TPG’s real estate platform, includes TPG Real Estate Partners, TPG’s real estate equity investment platform, and us, currently TPG’s dedicated real estate debt investment platform. Collectively, TPG Real Estate managed more than $10 billion in real estate and real estate-related assets at September 30, 2018. TPG Real Estate’s teams work across TPG’s New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and London offices, and have 21 and 35 employees, respectively, between TPG’s real estate debt investment platform and TPG’s real estate equity platform.
 2


Our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and other executive officers are senior TPG Real Estate professionals. None of our executive officers, our Manager, or other personnel supplied to us by our Manager is obligated to dedicate any specific amount of time to our business. Our Manager is subject to the supervision and oversight of our board of directors and has only such functions and authority as our board of directors delegates to it. Pursuant to a management agreement between our Manager and us (our “Management Agreement”), our Manager is entitled to receive a base management fee, an incentive fee, and certain expense reimbursements. 
 See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for more detail on the terms of the Management Agreement. 
 Investment Strategy
 The loans we target for origination and investment typically have the following characteristics:
  
• | Unpaid principal balance greater than $50 million;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | Stabilized as-is loan-to value (“LTV”) of less than 75% with respect to individual properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Floating rate loans tied to the one-month U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and spreads of 275 to 400 basis points over LIBOR;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Secured by properties that are: (1) primarily in the office, mixed use, multifamily, industrial, retail and hospitality real estate sectors; (2) expected to reach stabilization within 24 months of the origination or acquisition date; and (3) located in primary and select secondary markets in the U.S. with multiple demand drivers, such as employment growth, medical infrastructure, universities, convention centers and attractive cultural and lifestyle amenities; and,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well-capitalized sponsors with substantial experience in particular real estate sectors and geographic markets.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our current investment strategy provides significant opportunities to our stockholders for attractive risk-adjusted returns over time. However, to capitalize on the investment opportunities at different points in the economic and real estate investment cycle, we may modify or expand our investment strategy. We believe that the flexibility of our strategy supported by our Manager’s significant commercial real estate experience and the extensive resources of TPG and TPG Real Estate will allow us to take advantage of changing market conditions to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.
 We invest primarily in commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt instruments, focusing on loans secured by properties primarily in the office, mixed use, multifamily, industrial, retail and hospitality real estate sectors in primary and select secondary markets in the U.S., including, but not limited to, the following:
  
• | Commercial Mortgage Loans. We intend to focus on directly originating and selectively acquiring first mortgage loans. These loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on a commercial property, may vary in duration, predominantly bear interest at a floating rate, may provide for regularly scheduled principal amortization and typically require a balloon payment of principal at maturity. These investments may encompass a whole commercial mortgage loan or may include a pari passu participation within a commercial mortgage loan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Commercial Real Estate-Related Debt Instruments. Although originating and selectively acquiring commercial first mortgage loans is our primary area of focus, from time to time we opportunistically originate and selectively acquire other commercial real estate-related debt instruments, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and exclusion or exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act, including, but not limited to, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans, secured real estate securities, note financing, preferred equity and miscellaneous debt instruments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As market conditions evolve over time, we expect to adapt as appropriate. We believe our current investment strategy will produce significant opportunities to make investments with attractive risk-return profiles. However, to capitalize on the investment opportunities that arise at various other points of an economic cycle, we may expand or change our investment strategy by targeting assets with debt characteristics, such as subordinate mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, real estate securities and note financings. We may also target assets with equity characteristics, including triple net lease properties and other forms of direct equity ownership of commercial real estate properties, subject to any duties to offer to other funds managed by TPG.

We believe that the diversification of our investment portfolio, our ability to actively manage those investments, and the flexibility of our strategy positions us to generate attractive returns for our stockholders in a variety of market conditions over the long term. 
 Investment Portfolio
 As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 60 first mortgage loans (or interests therein) with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $4.3 billion, collectively having a weighted average credit spread of 3.9%, a weighted average all-in yield of 6.6%, a weighted average term to extended maturity (assuming all extension options are exercised by borrowers) of 3.9 years, and a weighted average LTV of 64.5%. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of the loan commitments in our portfolio consisted of floating rate, first mortgage loans (or interests therein). We also had $634.2 million of unfunded loan commitments as of December 31, 2018, our funding of which is subject to satisfaction of borrower milestones. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we held four CMBS investments, with an aggregate face amount of $76.4 million and a weighted average yield to expected maturity of 4.0%.
Loan Portfolio
 The following table details overall statistics for our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): 
 
 
 | Loan Portfolio Exposure(1) | 
Number of loans | | 60 | 
Floating rate loans (by unpaid principal balance) | | 100.0 | %
Total loan commitment | $ | 4,947,749 | 
Unpaid principal balance | $ | 4,313,591 | 
Unfunded loan commitments(2) | $ | 634,158 | 
Carrying value | $ | 4,293,788 | 
Weighted average credit spread(3) | | 3.9 | %
Weighted average all-in yield(3) | | 6.6 | %
Weighted average term to extended maturity (in years)(4) | | 3.9 | 
Weighted average LTV(5) | | 64.5 | %


(1) | In certain instances, we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party. In either case, the senior mortgage loan (i.e., the non-consolidated senior interest) is not included on our balance sheet. When we create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, we retain on our balance sheet a mezzanine loan. Total loan commitment encompasses the entire loan portfolio we originated, acquired and financed. At December 31, 2018, we did not have any non-consolidated senior interests outstanding. See Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investment Portfolio Financing—Non-Consolidated Senior Interests” in this Form 10-K for additional information.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Unfunded loan commitments may be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date or a force-funding date, primarily to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by our borrowers, to finance operating deficits during renovation and lease-up, and in some instances to finance development.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | As of December 31, 2018, our floating rate loans were indexed to LIBOR. In addition to credit spread, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, purchase price premium and discount, loan origination costs and accrual of both extension and exit fees. Credit spread and all-in yield for the total portfolio assumes the applicable floating benchmark rate as of December 31, 2018 for weighted average calculations.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Extended maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; provided, however, that our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2018, based on the unpaid principal balance of our total loan exposure, 76.8% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 23.2% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | LTV is calculated as the total outstanding principal balance of the loan or participation interest in a loan plus any financing that is pari passu with or senior to such loan or participation interest as of December 31, 2018, divided by the applicable as-is real estate value at the time of origination or acquisition of such loan or participation interest in a loan. The as-is real estate value reflects our Manager’s estimates, at the time of origination or acquisition of a loan or participation interest in a loan, of the real estate value underlying such loan or participation interest, determined in accordance with our Manager’s underwriting standards and consistent with third-party appraisals obtained by our Manager.

The following presents, by loan commitment, the property types securing our loan portfolio and the geographic distribution of our loan portfolio, each as of December 31, 2018:


Our loan portfolio consists of Bridge, Light Transitional and Moderate Transitional floating rate loans. These loan categories are utilized by us to classify, define, and assess our loan investments. Generally, loans are classified based on a percentage of deferred fundings of the total loan commitment. Bridge loans limit deferred fundings to less than 10%, while Light and Moderate Transitional loans limit deferred fundings from 10% to 20% and over 20%, respectively. The deferred fundings are commonly conditioned on the borrower’s satisfaction of certain collateral performance tests, the completion of specified property improvements, or both. The following presents, by loan commitment, our loan portfolio by loan category as of December 31, 2018:
 

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, no loans were placed on non-accrual status, and we have sustained no losses or impairments to our loan portfolio.
 5


CMBS Portfolio
 We invest from time to time in CMBS and CMBS-related assets as part of our investment strategy, often as a short-term cash management tool. As of December 31, 2018, our CMBS portfolio consisted of four fixed rate securities, the underlying collateral of which consists of first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties. The underlying real estate collateral is located across the United States, primarily in California and Texas, with no state representing more than 24.3% of an investment’s current face amount. Additionally, the payment of principal and interest on the securities in our CMBS portfolio at December 31, 2018 is guaranteed by a U.S. Government agency or a U.S. government sponsored enterprise (“GSE”). At December 31, 2018, there were no floating rate securities in our CMBS Portfolio.
 The following table details overall statistics for our CMBS portfolio as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): 
 
 
 | CMBS Investment Exposure | 
-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-------
Number of CMBS investments | | 4 | 
Fixed rate CMBS investments (by current face amount) | | 100.0 | %
Par value | $ | 77,896 | 
Current face amount(1) | $ | 76,404 | 
Weighted average coupon(2) | | 3.4 | %

(2) | Weighted by market value as of December 31, 2018.
----+--------------------------------------------------


(3) | The largest structured finance investment is 100% collateralized by multifamily mortgage loans underwritten by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), which loans are slated for near term securitization by FHLMC. Upon the contractual maturity of the structured finance investment, FHLMC is required to purchase all of the performing mortgage loans at par. Currently, all of the underlying mortgage loans are performing. The other CMBS investments are structured finance investments issued by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae which are backed primarily by mortgage loans on multifamily properties that satisfy GSE program requirements. These bonds are unrated but carry a government guaranty.

Financing Strategy 
 In addition to raising capital through public offerings of our equity and debt securities, our financing strategy includes a combination of secured revolving repurchase agreements, senior secured and secured credit agreements, term loan facilities, asset-specific financing structures, and issuances of non-recourse collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). We may use other forms of leverage, including, structured financing, derivative instruments, and public and private secured and unsecured debt issuances by us or our subsidiaries. In certain instances, we may create structural leverage through the co-origination or non-recourse syndication of a senior loan interest to a third party, providing matched term financing.
 We generally seek to match-fund and match-index our investments by minimizing the differences between the durations and indices of our investments and those of our liabilities, respectively, including in certain instances through the use of derivatives. Under certain circumstances, we may determine not to do so or we may otherwise be unable to do so. 
 The following table details the principal balance amounts outstanding for our financing arrangements as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): 
 
 
 | Portfolio Financing Outstanding Principal Balance | 
---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+----------
 | December 31, 2018 | 
Collateralized loan obligations | $ | 1,522,377
Secured revolving repurchase agreements | | 1,044,145
Senior secured and secured credit agreements | | 460,381 
Term loan facility | | 114,262 
Asset-specific financing | | 32,500 
Total indebtedness(1) | $ | 3,173,665


(1) | Excludes deferred financing costs of $23.8 million at December 31, 2018.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The amount of leverage we employ for particular assets will depend upon our Manager’s assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility, and other risks of those assets and the financing counterparties, the availability of particular types of financing at the time, and the financial covenants under our financing arrangements. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets and the amount of leverage we use will be at the discretion of our Manager and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders. We currently expect that our leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to equity, will generally range from 3.0 to 3.5:1, subject to compliance with our financial covenants under our secured revolving repurchase agreements and other contractual obligations. We will endeavor to match the terms and indices of our assets and liabilities. 
 Floating Rate Portfolio
 Our business model seeks to minimize our exposure to changing interest rates by match-indexing our assets using the same, or similar, benchmark indices, typically LIBOR, as well as durations. Accordingly, rising interest rates will generally increase our net interest income, while declining interest rates will generally decrease our net interest income. As of December 31, 2018, 100.0% of our loans by unpaid principal balance earned a floating rate of interest and were financed with liabilities that require interest payments based on floating rates, which resulted in approximately $1.2 billion of net floating rate exposure that is positively correlated to rising interest rates, subject to the impact of interest rate floors on certain of our floating rate loans. Due to the short remaining term to maturity and floating rate nature of our loan portfolio, we have elected not to employ interest rate derivatives (interest rate swaps, caps, collars or swaptions) to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates on such liabilities, but we may do so in the future.

The following presents how an increase in LIBOR would affect our net interest income per share per annum as of December 31, 2018:

Investment Guidelines
 Our board of directors has approved the following investment guidelines:
  
• | No investment will be made that would cause us to fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No investment will be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Manager will seek to invest our capital in our target assets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to the deployment of our capital into our target assets, our Manager may cause our capital to be invested in any short-term investments in money market funds, bank accounts, overnight repurchase agreements with primary Federal Reserve Bank dealers collateralized by direct U.S. government obligations and other instruments or investments determined by our Manager to be of high quality;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Not more than 25% of our Equity (as defined in our Management Agreement) may be invested in any individual investment without the approval of a majority of our independent directors (it being understood, however, that for purposes of the foregoing concentration limit, in the case of any investment that is comprised (whether through a structured investment vehicle or other arrangement) of securities, instruments or assets of multiple portfolio issuers, such investment for purposes of the foregoing limitation will be deemed to be multiple investments in such underlying securities, instruments and assets and not the particular vehicle, product or other arrangement in which they are aggregated); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Any investment in excess of $300 million requires the approval of a majority of our independent directors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These investment guidelines may be amended, supplemented or waived pursuant to the approval of our board of directors (which must include a majority of our independent directors) from time to time, but without the approval of our stockholders.

Competition
 We are engaged in a competitive business environment. We operate in a competitive market for the origination and acquisition of attractive investment opportunities. We compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, debt funds, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, financial institutions, private equity and hedge funds, governmental bodies and other entities and may compete with other TPG Funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. Several of our competitors, including other REITs, have recently raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital and may have investment objectives that overlap with our investment objectives, which may create additional competition for lending and other investment opportunities. Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that may not be available to us or are only available to us on substantially less attractive terms. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more lending relationships than we do. Competition may result in realizing fewer investments, higher prices, acceptance of greater risk, greater defaults, lower yields or a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs. In addition, competition for attractive investments could delay the investment of our capital.
 In the face of this competition, we have access to our Manager’s professionals through TPG and TPG Real Estate, and their industry expertise, which may provide us with a competitive advantage in competing effectively for attractive investment opportunities and help us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential investments. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face. For additional information concerning these competitive risks, see Item 1A - “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Lending and Investment Activities—We operate in a competitive market for the origination and acquisition of attractive investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to originate or acquire attractive investments in our target assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us.”
 Employees
 We do not have any employees. We are externally managed and are advised by our Manager pursuant to our Management Agreement between our Manager and us. All of our executive officers and certain of our directors are employees of our Manager or its affiliates. We do not expect to have any employees.
Government Regulation
 Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by U.S. and other governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which among other things: (i) regulate credit-granting activities; (ii) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (iii) require disclosures to customers; (iv) govern secured transactions; and (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices. We are also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans. We intend to conduct our business so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
 In our judgment, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business. In recent years, legislators in the United States and in other countries have said that greater regulation of financial services firms is needed, particularly in areas such as risk management, leverage, and disclosure. While we expect that additional new regulations in these areas may be adopted and existing ones may change in the future, it is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon our future business, financial condition, or results of operations or prospects.

Operating and Regulatory Structure
 REIT Qualification
 We made an election to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, in order for us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. Our qualification as a REIT also depends on our ability to meet various other requirements imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, which relate to organizational structure, diversity of stock ownership, and certain restrictions with regard to the nature of our assets and the sources of our income. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal excise taxes and state and local taxes on our income and assets. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates, including, for taxable years beginning before December 31, 2017, any applicable alternative minimum tax, and applicable state and local taxes, and will not be able to qualify as a REIT for the subsequent four years. 
 Furthermore, we have one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which pay U.S. federal, state, and local income tax on their net taxable income. See Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items” for additional tax status information.
 Investment Company Act Exclusion or Exemption
 We conduct, and intend to continue to conduct, our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Complying with provisions that allow us to avoid the consequences of registration under the Investment Company Act may at times require us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit the manner in which we conduct our operations. We conduct our operations so that we are not an “investment company” as defined in Section 3(a)(1)(A) or Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act. We believe we are not an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, we are primarily engaged in non-investment company businesses related to real estate. In addition, we intend to conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of “investment securities.” Excluded from the term “investment securities” (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act) are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are themselves not investment companies and are not relying on the exclusions from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Our interests in wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that qualify for the exclusion pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C), as described below, or another exclusion or exception under the Investment Company Act (other than Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof), do not constitute “investment securities.”
 We hold our assets primarily through direct or indirect wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are excluded from the definition of investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. We will classify our assets for purposes of certain of our subsidiaries’ Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption from the Investment Company Act based upon positions set forth by the SEC staff. Based on such positions, to qualify for the exclusion pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C), each such subsidiary generally is required to hold at least (i) 55% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and (ii) at least 80% of its assets in “qualifying” real estate assets and real estate-related assets.
 10


As a consequence of our seeking to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act on an ongoing basis, we and/or our subsidiaries may be restricted from making certain investments or may structure investments in a manner that would be less advantageous to us than would be the case in the absence of such requirements. In particular, a change in the value of any of our assets could negatively affect our ability to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act and cause the need for a restructuring of our investment portfolio. For example, these restrictions may limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to invest directly in mortgage-backed securities that represent less than the entire ownership in a pool of senior mortgage loans, debt and equity tranches of securitizations and certain asset-backed securities, non-controlling equity interests in real estate companies or in assets not related to real estate; however, we and our subsidiaries may invest in such securities to a certain extent. In addition, seeking to avoid the need to register under the Investment Company Act may cause us and/or our subsidiaries to acquire or hold additional assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or held or dispose of investments that we and/or our subsidiaries might not have otherwise disposed of, which could result in higher costs or lower proceeds to us than we would have paid or received if we were not seeking to comply with such requirements. Thus, avoiding registration under the Investment Company Act may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.
 If we were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use borrowings), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and portfolio composition, including disclosure requirements and restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Compliance with the Investment Company Act would, accordingly, limit our ability to make certain investments and require us to significantly restructure our business plan, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
