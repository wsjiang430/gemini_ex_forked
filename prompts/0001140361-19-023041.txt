ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General

Photronics, Inc. (and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to herein as "Photronics", the "Company", “we”, “our”, or “us”) is one of the world's leading manufacturers of photomasks, which are high precision photographic quartz or glass plates containing microscopic images of electronic circuits. Photomasks are a key element in the manufacture of semiconductors and flat-panel displays ("FPDs"), and are used as masters to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers and FPD substrates during the fabrication of integrated circuits ("ICs" or “semiconductors”), and a variety of FPDs and, to a lesser extent, other types of electrical and optical components. We currently have eleven manufacturing facilities, which are located in Taiwan (3), Korea, the United States (3), Europe (2), and two recently constructed facilities in China. Our FPD Facility in Hefei, China, and our IC facility in Xiamen, China, commenced production in the second and third quarters of our fiscal 2019, respectively.

Photronics is a Connecticut corporation, organized in 1969. Our principal executive offices are located at 15 Secor Road, Brookfield, Connecticut 06804, telephone (203) 775-9000. Our website address is http://www.photronics.com. We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information found on, or incorporated into, our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information regarding SEC registrants, including Photronics.

Products and Manufacturing Technology

We manufacture photomasks, which are used as masters to transfer circuit patterns onto semiconductor wafers and FPD substrates. Photomasks are manufactured in accordance with circuit designs provided to us on a confidential basis by our customers. IC and FPD photomask sets are manufactured in layers, each having a distinct pattern which is etched onto a different photomask. The resulting series of photomasks is then used to image the circuit patterns onto each successive layer of a semiconductor wafer or FPD substrate. The typical manufacturing process for a photomask involves the receipt and conversion of circuit design data to manufacturing pattern data. A lithography system then exposes the circuit pattern onto the photomask blank. The exposed areas are developed and etched to produce that pattern on the photomask. The photomask is then inspected for defects and conformity to the customer's design data. After any defects are repaired, the photomask is cleaned, any required pellicles (protective translucent cellulose membranes) are applied and, after final inspection, the photomask is shipped to the customer.

We currently support customers across the full spectrum of IC production and FPD technologies by manufacturing photomasks using electron beam or optical (laser-based) systems, which are the predominant technologies used for photomask manufacturing, and are capable of producing the finer line resolution, tighter overlay, and larger IC chip size for the more complex circuits currently being designed. Electron beam and laser-generated photomasks can be used to produce the most advanced semiconductors and FPD photomasks for use in an array of products. However, in the case of IC production, the large majority of higher-cost critical layer photomasks are fabricated using electron beam technologies, while photomasks produced using laser-based systems are used for all FPD photomasks and less critical IC photomasks.  End markets served with IC photomasks include devices used for microprocessors, memory, telecommunications, and related applications. We currently own a number of both high-end and mature electron beam and laser-based systems.

The first several layers of photomasks are sometimes required to be delivered by us within 24 hours from the time we receive the customers' design data. The ability to manufacture high-quality photomasks within short time periods is dependent upon robust processes, efficient manufacturing methods, high production yield, available manufacturing capacity, and high equipment reliability. We work to meet these requirements by making significant investments in research and development, capital equipment, manufacturing and data processing systems, and by utilizing statistical process control methods to optimize our manufacturing processes and reduce cycle times.

 

Quality control is an integral part of the photomask manufacturing process. Photomasks are manufactured in temperature, humidity, and particulate-controlled clean rooms because of the high level of precision, quality and manufacturing yield required. Each photomask is inspected several times during the manufacturing process to ensure compliance with customer specifications. We continue to make substantial investments in equipment to produce, inspect and repair photomasks to ensure that customer specifications are met.

The majority of IC photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries larger than 28 nanometers. At these geometries, we can produce full lines of photomasks, and there is no significant technology employed by our commercial competitors that is not also available to us. We are also capable of producing full lines of photomasks for high-end IC and FPD applications. In the case of ICs, this includes photomasks at and below the 28 nanometer technology node and, for FPDs, at and above the Generation 8 technology node and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) display screens. We hold customer-qualified manufacturing capability and own, or have access to, technology that enables us to compete in the high-end markets that serve IC and FPD applications.

Sales and Marketing

The market for photomasks primarily consists of domestic and non-US semiconductor and FPD manufacturers and designers. Photomasks are manufactured by independent merchant manufacturers like Photronics, and by semiconductor and FPD manufacturers that produce photomasks for their own use (captive manufacturers). In some instances, captive manufacturers also sell to other semiconductor or FPD manufacturers. Previously, there was a trend towards the divesture or closing of captive photomask operations by semiconductor manufacturers, and an increase in the share of the market served by independent manufacturers. This trend was driven by the increased complexity and cost of capital equipment used in manufacturing photomasks and the lack of economy of scale for many semiconductor and FPD manufacturers to effectively utilize the equipment. However, more recently, some captive mask facilities have been investing at faster rates than independent manufacturers to reach certain roadmap milestones, particularly in the foundry logic and memory spaces. Nevertheless, most captive manufacturers maintain business and technology relationships with independent photomask manufacturers for ongoing support.

Generally, Photronics and each of its customers engage in a qualification and correlation process before we become an approved supplier. Thereafter, based on the customer’s expectations, we typically negotiate pricing parameters for the customer's order. Some prices may remain in effect for an extended period of time. In many instances, we enter into sales arrangements with an understanding that, as long as our performance is competitive, we will receive a specified percentage of that customer's photomask requirements.

We conduct our sales and marketing activities primarily through a staff of full-time sales personnel and customer service representatives who work closely with the Company's management and technical personnel. We support non-US customers through both our domestic and foreign facilities and consider our presence in non-US markets to be an important factor in attracting new customers, as it provides global solutions to our customers, minimizes delivery time, and allows us to serve customers that utilize manufacturing foundries outside of the United States, principally in Asia. See Notes 7 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the amount of revenue and long-lived assets attributable to each of our geographic areas of operations.

Customers

We sell our products primarily to leading semiconductor and FPD manufacturers. During fiscal year 2019, we sold our products to approximately 550 customers. Revenue from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. accounted for approximately 16% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, and revenue from United Microelectronics Corp. Co. Ltd. accounted for approximately 15%, 15% and 16% of our total revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our five largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 46%, 47% and 43% of our revenue in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A significant decrease in the amount of revenue from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business prospects.
Seasonality

Our business is typically impacted during the first, and sometimes the second, quarter of our fiscal year by the North American, European, and Asian holiday periods, as some customers reduce their development and buying activities during those periods.
Research and Development

We primarily conduct research and development activities for IC photomasks at our U.S. nanoFab, which is located in Boise, Idaho, as well as at PK, Ltd. (“PKL”), our subsidiary in Korea and Photronics DNP Mask Corporation (“PDMC”), one of our joint venture subsidiaries in Taiwan. Research and development for FPD photomasks is primarily conducted at PKL. Additionally, we conduct site-specific research and development programs to support strategic customers. These research and development programs and activities are undertaken to advance our competitiveness in technology and manufacturing efficiency. We also conduct application-oriented research and development activities to support the early adoption of new photomask or supporting data and services technology into our customers' applications. Currently, research and development photomask activities for ICs are primarily focused on photomasks with wafer geometrics of 20 nanometer node and smaller and, for FPDs, on Generations 8 and 10.5+ substrate-size photomask process enhancements and photomask technology for complex FPD photomasks used in the manufacture of advanced mobile displays, such as AMOLED. We believe these core competencies will continue to be a critical part of semiconductor and FPD manufacturing, as optical lithography continues to scale capabilities on high-end devices. We incurred research and development expenses of $16.4 million, $14.5 million, and $15.9 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. It is our belief that we own, control, or license the proprietary information, including trade secrets and patents that is necessary for our business, as it is presently conducted. We also believe that our intellectual property and trade secret know-how will continue to be important to our maintaining technical leadership in the field of photomasks.
Intellectual Property Rights

We have developed and hold ownership interests in intellectual property (“IP”) rights, in the forms of patents issued in the U.S., and other trademark and trademark registrations in the U.S. and other countries. Patents in which we hold ownership interests generally relate to the manufacture of photomasks or the use of photomasks to manufacture other products. While we believe that our IP rights are, and will continue to be, important to our technical leadership in the field of photomasks, our operations are not dependent on any one individual IP right. In addition to patenting, when practicable, our IP rights, we further protect them, and our other proprietary processes, by utilizing non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers, and vendors.
Materials, Supplies and Equipment

Raw materials used by Photronics generally include: high precision quartz plates (including large area plates), which are used as photomask blanks and are primarily obtained from Japanese and Korean suppliers; pellicles and electronic grade chemicals, which are used in the manufacturing process; and compacts, which are durable plastic containers in which photomasks are shipped. These materials are generally sourced from several suppliers. We believe that our utilization of a select group of strategic suppliers enables us to access the most technologically advanced materials available. On an ongoing basis, we continue to consider additional supply sources.

We rely on a limited number of equipment suppliers to develop and supply the equipment used in the photomask manufacturing process. Although, historically, we have been able to obtain equipment on a timely basis, an inability to obtain equipment when required could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Backlog

The first several layers of a set of photomasks for a circuit pattern are often required to be shipped within 24 hours of receiving a customer's designs. Because of the short period between order and shipment dates (typically from 1 day to 2 weeks) for a significant amount of our revenue, the dollar amount of our current backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue.
International Operations

Revenues from our non-U.S. operations were approximately 81%, 79% and 77% of our total revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We believe that our ability to serve non-US markets is enhanced by our having, among other things, a local presence in the markets that we serve. This requires significant investments in financial, managerial, operational, and other resources.

Operations outside of the United States are subject to inherent risks, including fluctuations in exchange rates, political and economic conditions in various countries, legal compliance and regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, longer accounts receivable collection cycles, potential restrictions on transfers of funds, and potentially adverse tax consequences. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue outside of the United States and to deploy resources where they could otherwise be used to their greatest advantage and, consequently, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Notes 7 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements, respectively, present revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area.

Competition

The photomask industry is highly competitive, and most of our customers utilize multiple photomask suppliers. Our ability to compete depends primarily upon the consistency of our product quality, timeliness of delivery, competitive pricing, technical capability, and service, which we believe are the principal factors considered by customers in selecting their photomask suppliers. An inability to meet these requirements could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We also believe that geographic proximity to customers is an important factor in certain markets where cycle time from order to delivery is critical. While some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, or other resources than Photronics, we believe that we are able to compete effectively because of our dedication to customer service, investments in state-of-the-art photomask equipment and facilities, and experienced technical employees.

We estimate that, for the types of photomasks we manufacture (IC and FPD), the size of the total market (captive and merchant) is approximately $5.0 billion. Our competitors include Compugraphics International, Ltd., Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd (outside of Taiwan and China), Hoya Corporation, LG Innotek Co., Ltd., Shenzhen New Way Photomask Making Co., Ltd., SK-Electronics Co. Ltd., Supermask Co. Ltd., Taiwan Mask Corporation, and Toppan Printing Co., Ltd. We also compete with semiconductor and FPD manufacturers' captive photomask manufacturing operations that supply photomasks for internal use and, in some instances, also for external customers and foundries. We expect to face continued competition which, in the past, has led to pressure to reduce prices. We believe the pressure to reduce prices, together with the significant investment required in capital equipment to manufacture high-end photomasks, has contributed to the decrease in the number of independent manufacturers; we expect such pressure to continue in the future.

Employees

As of October 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,775 employees. We believe we offer competitive compensation and other benefits, and that our employee relations are good.
