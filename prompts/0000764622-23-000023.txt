ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Pinnacle West
Pinnacle West is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries.  We derive essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  APS is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to most of the State of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.

Pinnacle West’s other subsidiaries are El Dorado, BCE and 4CA.  Additional information related to these subsidiaries is provided later in this report. 

Our reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities, and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.

BUSINESS OF ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY

APS currently provides electric service to approximately 1.3 million customers.  We own or lease 6,340 MW of regulated generation capacity and we hold a mix of both long-term and short-term purchased power agreements for additional capacity, including a variety of agreements for the purchase of renewable energy.  During 2022, no single purchaser or user of energy accounted for more than 2.4% of our electric revenues.
 The following map shows APS’s retail service territory, including the locations of its generating facilities and principal transmission lines.
Energy Sources and Resource Planning 
To serve its customers, APS obtains power through its various generation stations and through purchased power agreements.  Resource planning is an important function necessary to meet Arizona’s future energy needs.  APS’s sources of energy by type used to supply energy to Native Load customers during 2022 were as follows:
*Renewables include energy from wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, DG, and solar PPAs. 
The share of APS’s energy supply being derived from clean resources is 51%, which includes energy from nuclear, renewables and DSM. 
BCE also has acquired minority ownership positions in two wind farms that achieved commercial operation in 2020. Both wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs. See “Business of Other Subsidiaries — Bright Canyon Energy” below for information regarding BCE’s investments.
Clean Energy Focus Initiatives
In response to climate change, the entire electric utility industry, as well as the global economy, is in the midst of a profound transition to clean energy and a new low-carbon economy. APS has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce carbon, including renewable energy procurement and development, and promotion of programs and rates that promote energy conservation, renewable energy use, and energy efficiency. See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Current and Future Resources” below for details of these plans and initiatives. APS currently has a diverse portfolio of renewable resources, 
including solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, and biomass. In addition, in January 2020, APS announced its Clean Energy Commitment, a three-pronged approach aimed at ultimately eliminating carbon-emitting resources from its electric generation resource portfolio. 
APS’s clean energy goals consist of three parts: 
•a 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;
•a 2030 target of achieving a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and
•a commitment to end APS’s use of coal-fired generation by 2031.
Among other strategies, APS intends to achieve these goals through various methods such as relying on Palo Verde, the nation’s largest producer of carbon-free energy; increasing clean energy resources, including renewables; developing energy storage; ceasing the use of coal-generated electricity; managing demand with a modern interactive grid; promoting customer technology and energy efficiency; and optimizing regional resources. Management takes into consideration climate change and other environmental risks in its strategy development, business planning, and enterprise risk management processes. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about APS’s Clean Energy Commitment. 
Over this same period of time, APS also intends to harden its infrastructure in order to improve climate resiliency, which involves system and operational improvements aimed at reducing the impact of extreme weather events and other climate-related disruptions upon APS’s operations. Among other resiliency strategies, APS anticipates increasing investments in a modern and more flexible electricity grid with advanced distribution technologies. APS plans to continue its comprehensive forest management programs aimed at reducing wildfires, as those risks become compounded by shorter, drier winters and longer, hotter summers as a result of climate change.
APS prepares an annual inventory of GHG emissions from its operations. For APS’s operations involving fossil-fuel electricity generation and electricity transmission and distribution, APS’s annual GHG inventory is reported to EPA under the EPA GHG Reporting Program. APS also voluntarily tracks APS’s GHG emissions arising from APS operations. In addition to reporting to the EPA, we publicly report Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions. This data is then communicated to the public in Pinnacle West’s annual Corporate Responsibility Report as performance data and in CDP Reports, which are available on our website (www.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility). The reports provide information related to the Company and its approach to sustainability and its workplace and environmental performance. The information on Pinnacle West’s website, including Corporate Responsibility Reports and CDP Reports, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report. 
Generation Facilities

APS has ownership interests in or leases the nuclear, gas, oil, coal, and solar generating facilities as well as energy storage facilities described below.  For additional information regarding these facilities, see Item 2.
Nuclear
Palo Verde Generating Station — Palo Verde is a 3-unit nuclear power plant located approximately 50 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona.  APS operates the plant and owns 29.1% of Palo Verde Units 1 and 3 
and approximately 17% of Unit 2.  In addition, APS leases approximately 12.1% of Unit 2, resulting in a 29.1% combined ownership and leasehold interest in that unit.  APS has a total entitlement from Palo Verde of 1,146 MW.

Palo Verde Leases — In 1986, APS entered into agreements with three separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back approximately 42% of its share of Palo Verde Unit 2 and certain common facilities.  The leaseback was originally scheduled to expire at the end of 2015 and contained options to renew the leases or to purchase the leased property for fair market value at the end of the lease terms.  On July 7, 2014, APS exercised the fixed rate lease renewal options.  The exercise of the renewal options originally resulted in APS retaining the assets through 2023 under one lease and 2033 under the other two leases. On April 1, 2021, APS executed an amendment relating to the lease agreement with the term ending in 2023. The amendment extends the lease term for this lease through 2033 and changes the lease payment. As a result of this amendment, APS will now retain the assets through 2033 under all three lease agreements. At the end of the lease renewal periods, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to two years, or return the assets to the lessors. See Note 17 for additional information regarding the Palo Verde Unit 2 sale leaseback transactions.

Palo Verde Operating Licenses — Operation of each of the three Palo Verde Units requires an operating license from the NRC.  The NRC issued full power operating licenses for Unit 1 in June 1985, Unit 2 in April 1986, and Unit 3 in November 1987, and issued renewed operating licenses for each of the three units in April 2011, which extended the licenses for Units 1, 2, and 3 to June 2045, April 2046, and November 2047, respectively.

Palo Verde Fuel Cycle — The participant owners of Palo Verde are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs.  The fuel cycle for Palo Verde is comprised of the following stages:
•mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates;
•conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride;
•enrichment of uranium hexafluoride;
•fabrication of fuel assemblies;
•utilization of fuel assemblies in reactors; and
•storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

The Palo Verde participants have contracted for 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for uranium concentrates through 2028 and 48% through 2029; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for conversion services through 2030 and 40% through 2031; 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for enrichment services through 2026 and 28% for 2027; and 100% of Palo Verde’s requirements for fuel fabrication through 2027 for Unit 2 and Unit 1 and 2028 for Unit 3.
Spent Nuclear Fuel and Waste Disposal — The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (“NWPA”) required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998.  The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and/or High-Level Radioactive Waste (the “Standard Contract”) with each nuclear power plant.  The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998.  The DOE had planned to meet its NWPA and Standard Contract disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  In June 2008, the DOE submitted its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application to the NRC, but in March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice the Yucca Mountain construction 
authorization application.  Several legal proceedings followed challenging DOE’s withdrawal of its Yucca Mountain construction authorization application and the NRC’s cessation of its review of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application, which were consolidated into one matter at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the “D.C. Circuit”). Following the D.C. Circuit’s August 2013 order, the NRC issued two volumes of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. Publication of these volumes do not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository. APS is directly involved in legal proceedings related to the DOE’s failure to meet its statutory and contractual obligations regarding acceptance of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.

APS Lawsuit for Breach of Standard Contract — In December 2003, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the Palo Verde participants, filed a lawsuit against the DOE in the United States Court of Federal Claims (“Court of Federal Claims”) for damages incurred due to the DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract.  The Court of Federal Claims ruled in favor of APS and the Palo Verde participants in October 2010 and awarded damages to APS and the Palo Verde participants for costs incurred through December 2006.

On December 19, 2012, APS, acting on behalf of itself and the participant owners of Palo Verde, filed a second breach of contract lawsuit against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims. This lawsuit sought to recover damages incurred due to the DOE’s breach of the Standard Contract for failing to accept Palo Verde’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste from January 1, 2007 through June 30, 2011, as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of the Standard Contract and the NWPA. On August 18, 2014, APS and the DOE entered into a settlement agreement, stipulating to a dismissal of the lawsuit and payment by the DOE to the Palo Verde owners for certain specified costs incurred by Palo Verde during the period January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2011. In addition, the settlement agreement provided APS with a method for submitting claims and getting recovery for costs incurred through December 31, 2016, which was extended to December 31, 2022. An additional extension is currently pending. 
APS has submitted eight claims pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014 settlement agreement for eight separate time periods during July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2021. The DOE has approved and paid $123.9 million for these claims (APS’s share is $36 million). The amounts recovered were primarily recorded as adjustments to a regulatory liability and had no impact on reported net income. In accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, this regulatory liability is being refunded to customers. See Note 3. On October 31, 2022, APS filed its ninth claim pursuant to the terms of the August 18, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of $14.3 million (APS’s share is $4.2 million). In February 2023, the DOE approved this claim.
Waste Confidence and Continued Storage — On June 8, 2012, the D.C. Circuit issued its decision on a challenge by several states and environmental groups of the NRC’s rulemaking regarding temporary storage and permanent disposal of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.  The petitioners had challenged the NRC’s 2010 update to the agency’s waste confidence decision and temporary storage rule (“Waste Confidence Decision”). The D.C. Circuit found that the NRC’s evaluation of the environmental risks from spent nuclear fuel was deficient, and therefore remanded the Waste Confidence Decision update for further action consistent with National Environmental Policy Act. In September 2013, the NRC issued its draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement (“GEIS”) to support an updated Waste Confidence Decision. On August 26, 2014, the NRC approved a final rule on the environmental effects of continued storage of spent nuclear fuel. Renamed as the Continued Storage Rule, the NRC’s decision adopted the findings of the GEIS regarding the environmental impacts of storing spent fuel at any reactor site after the reactor’s licensed period of operations. As a result, those generic impacts do not need to be 
re-analyzed in the environmental reviews for individual licenses. The final Continued Storage Rule was subject to continuing legal challenges before the NRC and the Court of Appeals. In June 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its final decision, rejecting all remaining legal challenges to the Continued Storage Rule. On August 8, 2016, the D.C. Circuit denied a petition for rehearing.

Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site independent spent fuel storage installation (“ISFSI”) to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license period, which ends in December 2027. Additionally, Palo Verde has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation, which ends in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, APS will evaluate alternative storage solutions that may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the period of extended operation.

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs — APS currently relies on an external sinking fund mechanism to meet the NRC financial assurance requirements for decommissioning its interests in Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3.  The decommissioning costs of Palo Verde Units 1, 2 and 3 are currently included in APS’s ACC jurisdictional rates.  Decommissioning costs are recoverable through a non-bypassable system benefits charge (paid by all retail customers taking service from the APS system).  Based on current nuclear decommissioning trust asset balances, site specific decommissioning cost studies, anticipated future contributions to the decommissioning trusts, and return projections on the asset portfolios over the expected remaining operating life of the facility, we are on track to meet the current site-specific decommissioning costs for Palo Verde at the time the units are expected to be decommissioned. See Note 18 for additional information about APS’s nuclear decommissioning trusts.

Palo Verde Liability and Insurance Matters — See “Palo Verde Generating Station — Nuclear Insurance” in Note 10 for a discussion of the insurance maintained by the Palo Verde participants, including APS, for Palo Verde.

Natural Gas and Oil Fueled Generating Facilities
APS has six natural gas power plants located throughout Arizona, consisting of Redhawk, located near Palo Verde; Ocotillo, located in Tempe (discussed below); Sundance, located in Coolidge; West Phoenix, located in southwest Phoenix; Saguaro, located north of Tucson; and Yucca, located near Yuma. Several of the units at Yucca run on either gas or oil. APS has two oil-only power plants: Fairview, located in the town of Douglas, Arizona and Yucca GT-4 in Yuma, Arizona. APS owns and operates each of these plants with the exception of one oil-only combustion turbine unit and one oil and gas steam unit at Yucca that are operated by APS and owned by the Imperial Irrigation District. APS has a total entitlement from these plants of 3,573 MW. A portion of the gas for these plants is financially hedged up to three years in advance of purchasing and that position is converted to a physical gas purchase one month prior to delivery. APS has long-term gas transportation agreements with three different companies, some of which are effective through 2049. Fuel oil is acquired under short-term purchases delivered by truck directly to the power plants.
Ocotillo was originally a 330 MW 4-unit gas plant located in Tempe. In early 2014, APS announced a project to modernize the plant, which involved retiring two older 110 MW steam units, adding five 102 MW combustion turbines, and maintaining two existing 55 MW combustion turbines. In total, this increased the capacity of the site by 290 MW to 620 MW. The Ocotillo modernization project was completed in 2019.
Coal Fueled Generating Facilities
Four Corners — Four Corners is located in the northwestern corner of New Mexico and was originally a 5-unit coal-fired power plant. APS owns 100% of Units 1, 2 and 3, which were retired as of December 30, 2013. APS operates the plant and owns 63% of Four Corners Units 4 and 5. APS has a total entitlement from Four Corners of 970 MW. Additionally, 4CA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West, owned 7% of Units 4 and 5 from July 2016 through July 2018 following its acquisition of El Paso’s interest in these units described below. As part of APS’s Clean Energy Commitment, APS has committed to cease using coal-fired generation as part of its portfolio of electricity generating resources, including Four Corners, by 2031. 
NTEC, a company formed by the Navajo Nation to own the mine that serves Four Corners and develop other energy projects, is the coal supplier for Four Corners. The Four Corners’ co-owners executed a long-term agreement for the supply of coal to Four Corners from July 2016 through 2031 (the “2016 Coal Supply Agreement”). El Paso, a 7% owner of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners, did not sign the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement. Under the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement, APS agreed to assume the 7% shortfall obligation. On February 17, 2015, APS and El Paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by APS, or an affiliate of APS, of El Paso’s 7% interest in each of Units 4 and 5 of Four Corners. 4CA purchased the El Paso interest on July 6, 2016. The purchase price was immaterial in amount, and 4CA assumed El Paso’s reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7% interest. 
On June 29, 2018, 4CA and NTEC entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the sale to NTEC of 4CA’s 7% interest in Four Corners. NTEC assumed 4CA’s reclamation and decommissioning obligations associated with the 7% interest. The sale transaction closed on July 3, 2018. NTEC purchased the 7% interest at 4CA’s book value, approximately $70 million and paid the purchase price over four years pursuant to a secured interest-bearing promissory note, which was paid in full as of June 30, 2022. In connection with the sale, Pinnacle West guaranteed certain obligations that NTEC will have to the other owners of Four Corners, such as NTEC’s 7% share of capital expenditures and operating and maintenance expenses. Pinnacle West’s guarantee is secured by a portion of APS’s payments to be owed to NTEC under the 2016 Coal Supply Agreement.
APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041. The Navajo Nation approved these amendments in March 2011. The effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the DOI, as did a related federal rights-of-way grant. A federal environmental review was undertaken as part of the DOI review process and culminated in the issuance by DOI of a record of decision on July 17, 2015, justifying the agency action to extend the life of the plant and the adjacent mine. 
In June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners beginning in fall 2023, subject to the necessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership. Under seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons when electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring. The other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages. APS anticipates that it will elect not to begin seasonal operation in November 2023, unless market conditions change.

Cholla — Cholla was originally a 4-unit coal-fired power plant, which is located in northeastern Arizona. APS operates the plant and owns 100% of Cholla Units 1, 2 and 3. PacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4, and APS operated that unit for PacifiCorp. On September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Cholla Unit 2 and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if EPA approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules. On April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS’s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS’s remaining investment in the Unit. APS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015. Following the closure of Unit 2, APS has a total entitlement from Cholla of 381 MW. In early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS’s compromise proposal, which took effect for Cholla on April 26, 2017. In December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020. APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units by 2025.
APS purchases all of Cholla’s coal requirements from a coal supplier that mines all of the coal under long-term leases of coal reserves with the federal and state governments and private landholders. The Cholla coal contract runs through 2024. In addition, APS has a coal transportation contract that runs through 2024.
Navajo Plant — The Navajo Plant was a 3-unit coal-fired power plant located in northern Arizona. Salt River Project operated the plant and APS owned a 14% interest in Units 1, 2 and 3. APS had a total entitlement from the Navajo Plant of 315 MW. The Navajo Plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government. 
The co-owners of the Navajo Plant and the Navajo Nation agreed that the Navajo Plant would remain in operation until December 2019 under the existing plant lease. The co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, which allowed for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations in November 2019. 
APS is currently recovering depreciation and a return on the net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant over its previously estimated life through 2026. APS will seek continued recovery in rates for the book value of its remaining investment in the plant. See Note 3 for details related to the resulting regulatory asset plus a return on the net book value as well as other costs related to retirement and closure, which are still being assessed and which may be material.
See Note 10 for information regarding APS’s coal mine reclamation obligations related to these coal-fired plants.
Solar Facilities
APS developed utility scale solar resources through the 180 MW ACC-approved AZ Sun Program, investing approximately $675 million in this program. These facilities are owned by APS and are located in multiple locations throughout Arizona. In addition to the AZ Sun Program, APS developed the 44 MW Red Rock Solar Plant, which it owns and operates. Two of our large customers purchase renewable energy credits from APS that are equivalent to the amount of renewable energy that Red Rock is projected to generate.
APS owns and operates more than thirty small solar systems around the state. Together they have the capacity to produce approximately 4 MW of renewable energy. This fleet of solar systems includes a 3 MW facility located at the Prescott Airport and 1 MW of small solar systems in various locations across 
Arizona. APS has also developed solar photovoltaic distributed renewable energy systems installed as part of the Community Power Project in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Community Power Project, approved by the ACC on April 1, 2010, was a pilot program through which APS owns, operates, and receives energy from approximately 1 MW of solar photovoltaic distributed renewable energy systems located within a certain test area in Flagstaff, Arizona. The pilot program is now complete and as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the participants have been transferred to the Solar Partner Program described below. Additionally, APS owns 13 MW of solar photovoltaic systems installed across Arizona through the ACC-approved Schools and Government Program. 
In December 2014, the ACC voted that it had no objection to APS implementing an APS-owned rooftop solar research and development program aimed at learning how to efficiently enable the integration of rooftop solar and battery storage with the grid. The first stage of the program, called the “Solar Partner Program,” placed 8 MW of residential rooftop solar on strategically selected distribution feeders in an effort to maximize potential system benefits, as well as made systems available to limited-income customers who could not easily install solar through transactions with third parties. The second stage of the program, which included an additional 2 MW of rooftop solar and energy storage, placed two energy storage systems sized at 2 MW on two different high solar penetration feeders to test various grid-related operation improvements and system interoperability, and was in operation by the end of 2016. The costs for this program have been included in APS’s rate base as part of the 2017 Rate Case Decision. 
In the 2017 Rate Case Decision, the ACC also approved the “APS Solar Communities” program. APS Solar Communities (formerly AZ Sun II) is a three-year program authorizing APS to spend $10 million to $15 million in capital costs each year to install utility-owned DG systems on low to moderate income residential homes, non-profit entities, Title I schools, and rural government facilities. The 2017 Rate Case Decision provided that all operations and maintenance expenses, property taxes, marketing and advertising expenses, and the capital carrying costs for this program will be recovered through the RES. Currently, APS has installed 11 MW of DG systems under the APS Solar Communities program. In the 2019 Rate Case decision, the ACC authorized APS to spend $20 million to $30 million in capital costs for the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of three years from the effective date of the decision.
Energy Storage
APS deploys a number of advanced technologies on its system, including energy storage. Energy storage provides capacity, improves power quality, can be utilized for system regulation and, in certain circumstances, be used to defer certain traditional infrastructure investments. Energy storage also aids in integrating renewable generation by storing excess energy when system demand is low and renewable production is high and then releasing the stored energy during peak demand hours later in the day and after sunset. APS is utilizing grid-scale energy storage projects to meet customer reliability requirements, increase renewable utilization, and further our understanding of how storage works with other advanced technologies and the grid. 
In 2018, APS issued a request for proposal (“RFP”) for approximately 106 MW of energy storage to be located at up to five of its AZ Sun sites. Based upon its evaluation of the RFP responses, APS decided to expand the initial phase of battery deployment to 141 MW by adding a sixth AZ Sun site.  These battery storage facilities are currently expected to be in service during the first quarter of 2023. On August 2, 2021, APS executed a contract for an additional 60 MW of utility-owned energy storage to be located on APS’s AZ Sun sites. This contract, with a 2023 in-service date, will complete the addition of storage on current APS-owned utility-scale solar facilities.
Additionally, in February 2019, APS signed two 20-year PPAs for energy storage totaling 150 MW. These PPAs were subject to ACC approval in order to allow for cost recovery through the PSA. APS received the requested ACC approval on January 12, 2021, and service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2023.
In December 2020, APS issued two RFPs (collectively, the “December 2020 RFPs”). As a result of the December 2020 RFPs, APS executed four 20-year PPAs for resources that include energy storage: (a) two PPAs for standalone energy storage resources totaling 300 MW; and (b) two PPAs for solar plus storage resources totaling 275 MW. The PPAs are also subject to ACC approval to enable cost recovery through the PSA. APS received the requested ACC approval for three out of four of the projects on December 16, 2021 and on April 13, 2022 for the remaining project. Service under the agreements is expected to begin in 2023 and 2024.
In May 2022, APS issued an RFP to address resource needs for 2025 and beyond (the “2022 RFP”). As a result of the 2022 RFP, as of January 2023, APS has executed a 20-year PPA for solar plus storage resources totaling 300 MW. The PPA is subject to ACC approval to enable cost recovery through the PSA, which was requested in December 2022 and approved in February 2023. Service under this agreement is expected to begin in 2025.
APS currently plans to install more than 1,200 MW of energy storage by 2025, including the energy storage projects under PPAs and AZ Sun retrofits described above. The remaining energy storage is expected to be made up of resources solicited through current and future RFPs. 
The following table summarizes the resources in APS’s energy storage portfolio that are in operation and under development as of December 31, 2022. Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions.

 | Net Capacity in Operation(MW) | Net Capacity Planned / UnderDevelopment (MW)
APS Owned Energy Storage | — | 201 
PPAs Energy Storage | — | 1,025 
Residential Energy Storage | 19(a) | 7 
Total Energy Storage Portfolio | 19 | 1,233 

(a) This includes 18.5 MW of APS customer-owned batteries and 0.2 MW of APS-owned residential batteries.
Renewable Energy Portfolio
To date, APS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned renewable resources totaling 3,894 MW, including solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and biogas. Of this portfolio, 2,418 MW are currently in operation and 1,476 MW are under contract for development or are under construction. Renewable resources in operation include 264 MW of facilities owned by APS, 736 MW of long-term purchased power agreements, and an estimated 1,418 MW of customer-sited, third-party owned distributed energy resources.

As previously discussed, in May 2022, APS issued an RFP to address resource needs for 2025 and beyond. The 2022 RFP solicits competitive proposals for approximately 1,000 MW to 1,500 MW of resources, including up to 600 MW to 800 MW of renewable resources to meet the needs of 2025 and 2026 while also considering resources that can be online as late as 2027. The 2022 RFP stopped accepting bids on July 15, 2022, and APS sent notifications to shortlisted bidders on September 23, 2022. As a result of the 2022 RFP, and as of December 31, 2022, APS has signed a PPA for 300 MW of solar plus energy storage resources and a PPA for 216 MW of wind resources. Once APS secures those important resources and closes out the 2022 RFP, APS intends to issue APS’s next RFP to address future resource needs.

APS’s strategy to achieve its RES requirements includes executing purchased power contracts for new facilities, ongoing development of distributed energy resources and procurement of new facilities to be owned by APS.  See “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Solar Facilities” above for information regarding APS-owned solar facilities and “Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Energy Storage” above for more information regarding APS-owned energy storage facilities.
The following table summarizes APS’s renewable energy sources currently in operation and under development as of December 31, 2022.  Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid.

Purchased Power Contracts
In addition to its own available generating capacity, APS purchases electricity under various arrangements, including long-term contracts and purchases through short-term markets to supplement its owned or leased generation and hedge its energy requirements.  A portion of APS’s purchased power expense is netted against wholesale sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.  See Note 15. APS continually assesses its need for additional capacity resources to assure system reliability. In addition, APS has also entered into several PPAs for energy storage. See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for details on our energy storage PPAs.
Purchased Power Capacity — APS’s purchased power capacity under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2022, is summarized in the table below.  All capacity values are based on net capacity unless otherwise noted.
Type | Dates Available | Capacity (MW)
Purchase Agreement (a) | Year-round through June 14, 2023 | 45 
Demand Response Agreement | Summer seasons through 2025 | 75 
Tolling Agreement | May 1 through October 31, 2021-2027 | 463 
Tolling Agreement | Summer seasons from Summer 2020 through Summer 2025 | 565 
Tolling Agreement | June 1 through September 30, 2020-2026 | 570 
Renewable Energy (b) | Various | 736 

(a)Up to 45 MW of capacity is available; however, the amount of electricity available to APS under this agreement is based in large part on customer demand and is adjusted annually.
(b)Does not include MW of capacity planned or under development. Renewable energy purchased power agreements are described in detail below under “Current and Future Resources — Renewable Energy Standard — Renewable Energy Portfolio.”
Current and Future Resources

Current Demand and Reserve Margin 
Electric power demand is generally seasonal.  In Arizona, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  APS’s 2022 peak one-hour demand on its electric system was recorded on July 11, 2022, at 7,587 MW, compared to the 2021 peak of 7,580 MW recorded on June 18, 2021.  APS’s reserve margin at the time of the 2022 peak demand, calculated using system load serving capacity, was 13%.  For 2023, due to expiring purchased power contracts, APS is procuring market resources to maintain its minimum 15% planning reserve criteria.
Future Resources and Resource Plan
ACC rules require utilities to develop 15-year Integrated Resource Plans (“IRP”) which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan timeframe.  The ACC reviews each utility’s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary requirements and whether it should be acknowledged. Based on an ACC decision, APS was originally required to file its IRP by April 1, 2020. On February 20, 2020, the ACC extended the deadline for all utilities to file their IRPs from April 1, 2020, to June 26, 2020. On June 26, 2020, APS filed its final IRP. On July 15, 2020, the ACC extended the schedule for final ACC review of utility IRPs to February 2021. In February 2022, the ACC acknowledged APS’s IRP. The ACC also approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including, setting an EES of 1.3% of retail sales annually (averaged over a three-year period) and a demand-side resource capacity of 35% of 2020 peak demand by January 1, 2030. Due to current projected future resource needs and load forecasts, APS continues to need to develop or acquire additional capacity. APS intends to file its next IRP later in 2023.
See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Clean Energy Focus Initiatives” and “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Energy Storage” above for information regarding future plans for energy storage. See “Business of Arizona Public Service Company — Energy Sources and Resource Planning — Generation Facilities — Coal-Fueled Generating Facilities” above for information regarding plans for Cholla, Four Corners and the Navajo Plant. 
Energy Imbalance Market & Wholesale Market
In 2016, APS began to participate in the Energy Imbalance Market (“EIM”), a voluntary, real-time optimization market operated by the CAISO. The EIM allows for rebalancing supply and demand in 15-minute blocks and dispatching generation every five minutes, instead of the traditional one-hour blocks. APS continues to expect that its participation in EIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources. APS is in discussions with the EIM operator, CAISO, and other EIM participants about the feasibility of creating a voluntary day-ahead market to achieve more cost savings and use the region’s renewable resources more efficiently. APS also is in discussions with Southwest Power Pool, a market operator developing a day-ahead and real-time market for the Western Interconnection. In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by the Western Power Pool. These efforts are driven by three objectives of reducing customer cost, improving reliability, and incorporating more clean energy on APS’s system.
Energy Modernization Plan 
On July 30, 2020, the ACC Staff issued final draft energy rules, which proposed 100% of retail kWh sales from clean energy resources by the end of 2050. Nuclear power was defined as a clean energy resource. The proposed rules also required 50% of retail energy served be renewable by the end of 2035. On November 13, 2020, the ACC approved a final draft energy rules package which required additional procedural steps in the rulemaking process. In June 2021, the ACC adopted clean energy rules based on a series of ACC amendments to the final energy rules. The adopted rules require 100% clean energy by 2070 and the following interim standards for carbon reduction from baseline carbon emissions level: 50% reduction by December 31, 2032; 65% reduction by December 31, 2040; 80% reduction by December 31, 2050, and 95% reduction by December 31, 2060. Since the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original Recommended Order and Opinion, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective. On January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process. Instead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider All-Source RFP requirements and the IRP process. During the August 2022 ACC Open Meeting, Commissioners voted to postpone a decision on the All-Source RFP and IRP rulemaking package until 2023. APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. See Note 3 for additional information related to these energy rules. 
Renewable Energy Standard 
In 2006, the ACC adopted the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including solar, wind, biomass, biogas, and geothermal technologies.  The renewable energy requirement is 13% of retail electric sales in 2023 and increases annually until it reaches 15% in 2025.  

A component of the RES is focused on stimulating development of distributed renewable energy systems.  Accordingly, under the RES, an increasing percentage of that requirement must be supplied from distributed energy resources.  This distributed renewable energy requirement, which was waived by the ACC as a part of APS’s 2023 RES Implementation Plan, would have been 30% of the overall RES requirement of 13% in 2023. On June 7, 2021, the ACC approved the 2021 RES Implementation Plan. On July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan, which was subsequently amended on December 9, 2021. On May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 RES Implementation Plan, including an 
amendment requiring a stakeholder working group to convene and develop a community solar program for the Commission’s consideration at a future date. On September 23, 2022, APS filed a community solar proposal in compliance with the ACC order that was informed by a stakeholder working group. APS is proposing a small, pilot scale program size of up to 140 MW that would be selected through a competitive RFP. The ACC has not yet ruled on the proposal. However, on November 10, 2022, the ACC approved a bifurcated community solar process, directing ACC Staff to develop a statewide policy through additional stakeholder involvement and establishing a separate evidentiary hearing to define other policy components. The community solar program was deferred to the ACC’s Hearing Division so that a formal evidentiary hearing could be held to consider issues of substance related to community solar. APS cannot predict the outcomes of these future activities. 
On July 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 RES Implementation Plan, and on November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2023 RES Implementation Plan, including APS’s requested waiver of the distributed energy requirement for 2023. The following table summarizes the RES requirement standard and its timing:

 | 2023 | 2025
RES (inclusive of distributed energy) as a percent of retail electric sales | 13% | 15% 
Percent of RES to be supplied from distributed renewable energy resources (a) | 30% | 30% 

(a)The distributed renewable energy requirement has been waived for 2023.
On April 21, 2015, the RES rules were amended to require utilities to report on all eligible renewable resources in their service territory, irrespective of whether the utility owns renewable energy credits associated with such renewable energy. The rules allow the ACC to consider such information in determining whether APS has satisfied the requirements of the RES. 
Demand Side Management
On January 1, 2011, Arizona regulators adopted an EES of 22% cumulative annual energy savings by 2020 to increase energy efficiency and other DSM programs encouraging customers to conserve energy, while incentivizing utilities to aid in these efforts that ultimately reduce the demand for energy. APS achieved the 22% EES in 2021. See Note 3 for information regarding energy efficiency, other DSM obligations and the Energy Modernization Plan.
Competitive Environment and Regulatory Oversight

Retail 

The ACC regulates APS’s retail electric rates and its issuance of securities.  The ACC must also approve any significant transfer or encumbrance of APS’s property used to provide retail electric service and approve or receive prior notification of certain transactions between Pinnacle West, APS, and their respective affiliates. See Note 3 for information regarding ACC’s regulation of APS’s retail electric rates.

APS is subject to varying degrees of competition from other investor-owned electric and gas utilities in Arizona (such as Southwest Gas Corporation), as well as cooperatives, municipalities, electrical districts, and similar types of governmental or non-profit organizations.  In addition, some customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, may own and operate generation facilities to meet 
some or all of their own energy requirements.  This practice is becoming more popular with customers installing or having installed products such as rooftop solar panels to meet or supplement their energy needs.

On May 9, 2013, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  The ACC subsequently opened a docket for this matter and received comments from a number of interested parties on the considerations involved in establishing retail electric deregulation in the state.  One of these considerations was whether various aspects of a deregulated market, including setting utility rates on a “market” basis, would be consistent with the requirements of the Arizona Constitution.  On September 11, 2013, after receiving legal advice from the ACC Staff, the ACC voted 4-1 to close the current docket and await full Arizona Constitutional authority before any further examination of this matter.  The motion approved by the ACC also included opening one or more new dockets in the future to explore options to offer more rate choices to customers and innovative changes within the existing cost-of-service regulatory model that could include elements of competition.  
On November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona. On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules. On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules. During a July 15, 2020 ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken. The ACC continues to discuss matters related to retail electric competition, including the potential for additional buy-through programs or other pilot programs. In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed and the Governor signed a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that had been in place in Arizona since 1998. APS cannot predict what impact, if any, this change will have on APS.
On August 4, 2021, Green Mountain Energy filed an application seeking a certificate of convenience and necessity to allow it to provide competitive electric generation service in Arizona. Green Mountain Energy has requested that the ACC grant it the ability to provide competitive service in APS’s and Tucson Electric Power Company’s certificated service territories and proposes to deliver a 100% renewable energy product to residential and general service customers in those service territories. APS opposes Green Mountain Energy’s application and intends to intervene to contest it. On November 3, 2021, the ACC submitted questions to the Office of the Arizona Attorney General, Civil Litigation Division, Consumer Protection & Advocacy Section (“Attorney General”) requesting legal opinions related to a number of issues surrounding retail electric competition and the ACC’s ability to issue competitive certificates convenience and necessity. On November 26, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued a procedural order indicating it would not be appropriate to set a schedule until the Attorney General has provided insights on the applicable law. 
On October 28, 2021, an ACC Commissioner docketed a letter directing ACC Staff and interested stakeholders to design a 200-300 MW pilot program that would allow residential and small commercial customers of APS to elect a competitive electricity supplier. The letter also states that similar programs should be designed for other Arizona regulated electric utilities. APS cannot predict the outcome of these future activities.
Wholesale

FERC regulates rates for wholesale power sales and transmission services.  See Note 3 for information regarding APS’s transmission rates.  During 2022, approximately 11.6% of APS’s electric operating revenues resulted from such sales and services.  APS’s wholesale activity primarily consists of managing fuel and purchased power supplies to serve retail customer energy requirements.  APS also sells, in the wholesale market, its generation output that is not needed for APS’s Native Load and, in doing so, competes with other utilities, power marketers and independent power producers.  Additionally, subject to specified parameters, APS hedges both electricity and natural gas.  The majority of these activities are undertaken to mitigate risk in APS’s portfolio.
Transmission and Delivery
APS continues to work closely with customers, stakeholders, and regulators to identify and plan for transmission needs that support new customers, system reliability, access to markets and clean energy development.  The capital expenditures table presented in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this report includes new APS transmission projects, along with other transmission costs for upgrades and replacements, including those for data center and semi-conductor manufacturing development.  APS is also working to establish and expand advanced grid technologies throughout its service territory to provide long-term benefits both to APS and its customers.  APS is strategically deploying a variety of technologies that are intended to allow customers to better manage their energy usage, minimize system outage durations and frequency, enable customer choice for new customer sited technologies, and facilitate greater cost savings to APS through improved reliability and the automation of certain delivery functions.
Environmental Matters
Climate Change 
Legislative Initiatives.  There have been no recent successful attempts by Congress to pass legislation that would regulate GHG emissions, and it is unclear at this time whether legislation regulating or limiting utility-sector GHG emissions under consideration in the 118th Congress will become law. In the event climate change legislation ultimately passes, the actual economic and operational impact of such legislation on APS depends on a variety of factors, none of which can be fully known until a law is written, enacted, and the specifics of the resulting program are established. These factors include, without limitation, the terms of the legislation with regard to allowed GHG emissions; the cost to reduce emissions; in the event a cap-and-trade program is established, whether any permitted emissions allowances will be allocated to source operators free of cost or auctioned (and, if so, the cost of those allowances in the marketplace) and whether offsets and other measures to moderate the costs of compliance will be available; and, in the event of a carbon tax, the amount of the tax per pound of carbon dioxide (“CO2”) equivalent emitted.
In addition to federal legislative initiatives, state-specific initiatives may also impact our business. While Arizona has no pending legislation regulating GHGs, the California legislature enacted AB 32 and SB 1368 in 2006 to address GHG emissions. In October 2011, the California Air Resources Board approved final regulations that established a state-wide cap on GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2013, and established a GHG allowance trading program under that cap. The first phase of the program, which applies to, among other entities, importers of electricity, commenced on January 1, 2013. Under the program, entities selling electricity into California, including APS, must hold carbon allowances to cover 
GHG emissions associated with electricity sales into California from outside the state. APS is authorized to recover the cost of these carbon allowances through the PSA. 
Regulatory Initiatives. In 2009, EPA determined that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare. As a result of this “endangerment finding,” EPA determined that the Clean Air Act required new regulatory requirements for new and modified major GHG emitting sources, including power plants. APS will generally be required to consider the impact of GHG emissions as part of its traditional New Source Review analysis for new major sources and major modifications to existing plants.
On June 19, 2019, EPA took final action on its proposals to repeal EPA’s 2015 Clean Power Plan (“CPP”) and replace those regulations with a new rule, the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations. EPA originally finalized the CPP on August 3, 2015, and such rules would have had far broader impact on the electric power sector than the ACE regulations. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE regulations and remanded them back to EPA to develop new existing power plant carbon regulations consistent with the court’s ruling. That decision, which endorsed an expansive view of the federal Clean Air Act consistent with EPA’s 2015 CPP, was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 30, 2022. While the current administration has expressed its intent to develop new carbon emission regulations governing existing power plants sometime in 2023, such action will be constrained by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that the CPP violated the Clean Air Act. Nonetheless, we cannot at this time predict the outcome of pending EPA rulemaking proceedings related to carbon emissions from existing power plants. 
Other environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants. The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of our coal plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants. The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our fossil-fuel powered plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments. APS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants as well as other costs related to early retirement but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery. 
EPA Environmental Regulation
Regional Haze Rules. In 1999, EPA announced regional haze rules to reduce visibility impairment in national parks and wilderness areas. The rules require states (or, for sources located on tribal land, EPA) to determine what pollution control technologies constitute the BART for certain older major stationary sources, including fossil-fuel fired power plants. EPA subsequently issued the Clean Air Visibility Rule, which provides guidelines on how to perform a BART analysis. Final regulations imposing BART requirements have now been imposed on each APS coal-fired power plant. Four Corners was required to install new pollution controls to comply with BART, while similar pollution control installation requirements were not necessary for Cholla. 
Cholla. In early 2017, EPA approved a final rule containing a revision to Arizona’s State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) for Cholla that implemented BART requirements for this facility, which did not require the installation of any new pollution control capital improvements. In conjunction with the closure of Cholla Unit 2 in 2015, APS has committed to ceasing coal combustion within Units 1 and 3 by 
April 2025. PacifiCorp retired Cholla Unit 4 at the end of 2020. See “Cholla” in Note 3 for information regarding future plans for Cholla and details related to the resulting regulatory asset. 

Four Corners. Based on EPA’s final standards, APS’s 63% share of the cost of required BART controls for Four Corners Units 4 and 5 was approximately $400 million, which has been incurred.  See Note 3 for information regarding the related rate recovery. In addition, APS and El Paso entered into an asset purchase agreement providing for the purchase by APS, or an affiliate of APS, of El Paso’s 7% interest in Four Corners Units 4 and 5. 4CA purchased the El Paso interest on July 6, 2016. NTEC purchased the interest from 4CA on July 3, 2018. The cost of the pollution controls related to the 7% interest is approximately $45 million, which was assumed by NTEC through its purchase of the 7% interest.
Coal Combustion Waste. On December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash. The rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the RCRA and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions. These criteria include standards governing location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements. The rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity. Such closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of recent regulatory and judicial activities described below.
Since these regulations were finalized, EPA has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing CCR disposal. While certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions, others have resulted from judicial review, court-approved settlements with environmental groups, and statutory changes to RCRA. The following lists the pending regulatory changes that, if finalized, could have a material impact as to how APS manages CCR at its coal-fired power plants:
•Following the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act in 2016, EPA possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for CCR management or issue federal permits governing CCR disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands. Although ADEQ has taken steps to develop a CCR permitting program, including supporting the passage of new state legislation providing ADEQ with appropriate permitting authority for CCR under the state solid waste management program, it is not clear when that program will be put into effect. On December 19, 2019, EPA proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of CCR management permits. The proposal remains pending. 
•On March 1, 2018, as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups, EPA proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities. Apart from a subsequent proposal issued on August 14, 2019, to add a specific, health-based groundwater protection standard for boron, EPA has yet to take action on this proposal. 
•With respect to APS’s Cholla facility, the Company’s application for alternative closure was submitted to EPA on November 30, 2020. While EPA has deemed APS’s application administratively “complete,” the Agency’s approval remains pending. If granted, this application would allow the continued disposal of CCR within Cholla’s existing unlined CCR surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coal-fired boiler operations in April 2025. This 
application will be subject to public comment and, potentially, judicial review. On January 11, 2022, EPA began issuing proposed decisions pursuant to this provision of the federal CCR regulations and APS anticipates receiving a proposed decision with respect to the Cholla facility in 2023. 
We cannot at this time predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when the EPA will take final action on those matters that are still pending. Depending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect APS’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
APS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners. APS estimates that its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for Four Corners is approximately $30 million and its share of incremental costs to comply with the CCR rule for Cholla is approximately $16 million. The Navajo Plant disposed of CCR only in a dry landfill storage area. To comply with the CCR rule for the Navajo Plant, APS’s share of incremental costs was approximately $1 million, which has been incurred. Additionally, the CCR rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring. 
As of October 2018, APS has completed the statistical analyses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring. APS determined that several of its CCR disposal units at Cholla and Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action. In addition, under the current regulations, all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure by April 11, 2021, at the latest (except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure). APS completed the assessments of corrective measures on June 14, 2019; however, additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway. In addition, APS will also solicit input from the public and host public hearings as part of this process. Based on the work performed to date, APS currently estimates that its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at Four Corners will likely range from $10 million to $15 million, which would be incurred over 30 years. The analysis needed to perform a similar cost estimate for Cholla remains ongoing at this time. As APS continues to implement the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process, the current cost estimates may change. Given uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment process, we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to the Company; however, at this time we do not believe the cost estimates for Cholla and any potential change to the cost estimate for Four Corners would have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Effluent Limitation Guidelines. On September 30, 2015, EPA finalized revised effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) establishing technology-based wastewater discharge limitations for fossil-fired EGUs.  EPA’s final regulation targets metals and other pollutants in wastewater streams originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling activities, scrubber activities, and coal ash disposal leachate.  Based upon an earlier set of preferred alternatives, the final effluent limitations generally require chemical precipitation and biological treatment for flue gas desulfurization scrubber wastewater, “zero discharge” from fly ash and bottom ash handling, and impoundment for coal ash disposal leachate.  
On August 11, 2017, EPA announced that it would be initiating rulemaking proceedings to potentially revise the September 2015 ELGs. On September 18, 2017, EPA finalized a regulation postponing the earliest date on which compliance with the ELGs for these waste-streams would be required from November 1, 2018, until November 1, 2020. At this time, APS’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) discharge permit for Four Corners contains a December 31, 2023, 
compliance deadline for achieving “zero discharge” of bottom ash transport waters. Nonetheless, on October 13, 2020, EPA published a final rule relaxing these “zero discharge” limitations for bottom ash handling water and allowing for approximately 10% of such wastewater to be discharged (on a volumetric, 30-day rolling average basis) under limited power plant operating scenarios. At this time, APS is pursuing a modification to the Four Corners NPDES discharge permit in order to implement the most recent ELG rulemaking. We cannot at this time predict the outcome of this permit modification proceeding, including any public commenting or permit appeal procedures. The Cholla facility does not require NPDES permitting. 
Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards. On October 1, 2015, EPA finalized revisions to the primary ground-level ozone NAAQS at a level of 70 parts per billion (“ppb”).  Further, on December 23, 2020, EPA issued a final regulation retaining the current primary NAAQS for ozone, following a required scientific review process. With ozone standards becoming more stringent, our fossil generation units will come under increasing pressure to reduce emissions of NOx and volatile organic compounds, and to generate emission offsets for new projects or facility expansions located in ozone nonattainment areas.  EPA was expected to designate attainment and nonattainment areas relative to the new 70 ppb standard by October 1, 2017.  While EPA took action designating attainment and unclassifiable areas on November 6, 2017, the Agency’s final action designating non-attainment areas was not issued until April 30, 2018. At that time, EPA designated the geographic areas containing Yuma and Phoenix, Arizona as in non-attainment with the 2015 70 ppb ozone NAAQS. The vast majority of APS’s natural gas-fired EGUs are located in these jurisdictions. Areas of Arizona and the Navajo Nation where the remainder of APS’s fossil-fuel fired EGU fleet is located were designated as in attainment. We anticipate that revisions to the SIPs and FIPs implementing required controls to achieve the new 70 ppb standard will be in place between 2023 and 2024.  At this time, because proposed SIPs and FIPs implementing the revised ozone NAAQSs have yet to be released, APS is unable to predict what impact the adoption of these standards may have on the Company. APS will continue to monitor these standards as they are implemented within the jurisdictions affecting APS.
Superfund-Related Matters. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water, or air.  Those who released, generated, transported to, or disposed of hazardous substances at a contaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a “PRP”). PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up. On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in Phoenix, Arizona. APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site. APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3. In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study (“RI/FS”). The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022. APS cannot predict the EPA’s timing with respect to this matter. APS estimates that its cost related to this investigation and study is approximately $3 million. APS anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the ultimate remediation requirements are not yet finalized by EPA, at the present time, expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated.
On August 6, 2013, the Roosevelt Irrigation District (“RID”) filed a lawsuit in Arizona District Court against APS and 24 other defendants, alleging that RID’s groundwater wells were contaminated by the release of hazardous substances from facilities owned or operated by the defendants.  The lawsuit also alleges that, under Superfund laws, the defendants are jointly and severally liable to RID.  The allegations against APS arise out of APS’s current and former ownership of facilities in and around OU3.  As part of a 
state governmental investigation into groundwater contamination in this area, on January 25, 2015, ADEQ sent a letter to APS seeking information concerning the degree to which, if any, APS’s current and former ownership of these facilities may have contributed to groundwater contamination in this area.  APS responded to ADEQ on May 4, 2015. On December 16, 2016, two RID environmental and engineering contractors filed an ancillary lawsuit for recovery of costs against APS and the other defendants in the RID litigation. That same day, another RID service provider filed an additional ancillary CERCLA lawsuit against certain of the defendants in the main RID litigation but excluded APS and certain other parties as named defendants. Because the ancillary lawsuits concern past costs allegedly incurred by these RID vendors, which were ruled unrecoverable directly by RID in November of 2016, the additional lawsuits do not increase APS’s exposure or risk related to these matters.
On April 5, 2018, RID and the defendants in that particular litigation executed a settlement agreement, fully resolving RID’s CERCLA claims concerning both past and future cost recovery. APS’s share of this settlement was immaterial. In addition, the two environmental and engineering vendors voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit against APS and the other named defendants without prejudice. An order to this effect was entered on April 17, 2018. With this disposition of the case, the vendors may file their lawsuit again in the future. On August 16, 2019, Maricopa County, one of the three direct defendants in the ancillary service provider lawsuit, filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution for its liability, if any, from APS and 28 other third-party defendants. While this lawsuit remains pending, on September 30, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona granted partial summary judgment to the direct defendants for $20.6 million of the $21 million in CERCLA response costs claimed by the service provider. We are unable to predict the outcome of any further litigation related to the remaining response costs at issue in this litigation; however, we do not expect the outcome to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
On February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS’s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona. In particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS’s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA’s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash (“SIBW”) Superfund site. The SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site. APS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022. On January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform APS that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years. At the present time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter and expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated.
Manufactured Gas Plant Sites. Certain properties which APS now owns or which were previously owned by it or its corporate predecessors were at one time sites of, or sites associated with, manufactured gas plants. APS is taking action to voluntarily remediate these sites. APS does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Four Corners National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit 
On July 16, 2018, several environmental groups filed a petition for review before the EPA Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) concerning the NPDES wastewater discharge permit for Four Corners, which was reissued on June 12, 2018. The environmental groups allege that the permit was reissued in contravention of several requirements under the Clean Water Act and did not contain required provisions concerning EPA’s 2015 revised ELGs for steam-electric EGUs, 2014 existing-source 
regulations governing cooling-water intake structures, and effluent limits for surface seepage and subsurface discharges from coal-ash disposal facilities. To address certain of these issues through a reconsidered permit, EPA took action on December 19, 2018, to withdraw the NPDES permit reissued in June 2018. Withdrawal of the permit moots the EAB appeal, and EPA filed a motion to dismiss on that basis. The EAB thereafter dismissed the environmental group appeal on February 12, 2019. EPA then issued a revised final NPDES permit for Four Corners on September 30, 2019. Based upon a November 1, 2019, filing by several environmental groups, the EAB again took up review of the Four Corners NPDES Permit. Oral argument on this appeal was held on September 3, 2020, and the EAB denied the environmental group petition on September 30, 2020. While on January 22, 2021, the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the EAB’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties to this litigation (including APS) finalized a settlement on May 2, 2022. This settlement requires investigation of thermal wastewater discharges from Four Corners, administratively closes the litigation filed in January of 2021, and is not expected to have a material impact on APS’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Water Supply
Based on a declaration from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, as of January 1, 2023, Arizona’s supply of Colorado River water will be subject to a Tier 2a shortage. This shortage will result in a reduction to Arizona’s share of the Colorado River water by 22 percent or 592,000-acre feet. This reduction, similar to the 2022 tier 1 shortage, will largely be felt by central Arizona’s agricultural users, mainly in Pinal County. In light of pre-existing mitigation measures at the state level, the Tier 2a shortage is not expected at this time to materially impact water supplies for customers in APS’s service territory, nor materially impact water supplies used by APS’s fleet of generation resources. As drought conditions across the southwestern U.S. region continue to worsen, APS will monitor water availability necessary for continued Company operations and, as necessary, implement measures to mitigate risks associated with future Colorado River shortage declarations. 
Assured supplies of water are important for APS’s generating plants. At the present time, APS has adequate water to meet its operating needs. The Four Corners region, in which Four Corners is located, has historically experienced drought conditions that may affect the water supply for the plants if adequate moisture is not received in the watershed that supplies the area. APS is continuing to work with area stakeholders to implement agreements to minimize the effect, if any, on future drought conditions that could have an impact on operations of its plants. 
Conflicting claims to limited amounts of water in the southwestern United States have resulted in numerous court actions, which, in addition to future supply conditions, have the potential to impact APS’s operations.
San Juan River Adjudication. Both groundwater and surface water in areas important to APS’s operations have been the subject of inquiries, claims, and legal proceedings, which will require a number of years to resolve. APS is one of a number of parties in a proceeding, filed March 13, 1975, before the Eleventh Judicial District Court in New Mexico to adjudicate rights to a stream system from which water for Four Corners is derived. An agreement reached with the Navajo Nation in 1985, however, provides that if Four Corners loses a portion of its rights in the adjudication, the Navajo Nation will provide, for an agreed upon cost, sufficient water from its allocation to offset the loss. In addition, APS is a party to a water contract that allows the Company to secure water for Four Corners in the event of a water shortage 
and is a party to a shortage sharing agreement, which provides for the apportionment of water supplies to Four Corners in the event of a water shortage in the San Juan River Basin.
Gila River Adjudication. A summons served on APS in early 1986 required all water claimants in the Lower Gila River Watershed in Arizona to assert any claims to water on or before January 20, 1987, in an action pending in Arizona Superior Court. Palo Verde is located within the geographic area subject to the summons. APS’s rights and the rights of the other Palo Verde participants to the use of groundwater and effluent at Palo Verde are potentially at issue in this adjudication. As operating agent of Palo Verde, APS filed claims that dispute the court’s jurisdiction over the Palo Verde participants’ groundwater rights and their contractual rights to effluent relating to Palo Verde. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. Several of APS’s other power plants are also located within the geographic area subject to the summons, including a number of gas-fired power plants located within Maricopa and Pinal Counties. In November 1999, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision confirming that certain groundwater rights may be available to the federal government and Indian tribes. In addition, in September 2000, the Arizona Supreme Court issued a decision affirming the lower court’s criteria for resolving groundwater claims. Litigation on both of these issues has continued in the trial court. In December 2005, APS and other parties filed a petition with the Arizona Supreme Court requesting interlocutory review of a September 2005 trial court order regarding procedures for determining whether groundwater pumping is affecting surface water rights. The Arizona Supreme Court denied the petition in May 2007, and the trial court is now proceeding with implementation of its 2005 order. No trial date concerning APS’s water rights claims has been set in this matter.
At this time, the lower court proceedings in the Gila River adjudication are in the process of determining the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for determining which groundwater wells located outside of the subflow zone of the Gila River should be subject to the adjudication court’s jurisdiction. A hearing to determine this jurisdictional test question was held in March 2018 in front of a special master, and a draft decision based on the evidence heard during that hearing was issued on May 17, 2018. The decision of the special master, which was finalized on November 14, 2018, accepts the proposed hydro-geologic testing protocols supported by APS and other industrial users of groundwater. A further ruling affirming this decision by the trial court judge overseeing the adjudication was issued on July 8, 2022. Further proceedings have been initiated to determine the specific hydro-geologic testing protocols for subflow depletion determinations. The determinations made in this final stage of the proceedings may ultimately govern the adjudication of rights for parties, such as APS, that rely on groundwater extraction to support their industrial operations. APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. 
Little Colorado River Adjudication. APS has filed claims to water in the Little Colorado River Watershed in Arizona in an action pending in the Apache County, Arizona, Superior Court, which was originally filed on September 5, 1985. APS’s groundwater resource utilized at Cholla is within the geographic area subject to the adjudication and, therefore, is potentially at issue in the case. APS’s claims dispute the court’s jurisdiction over its groundwater rights. Alternatively, APS seeks confirmation of such rights. No trial or pretrial proceedings have been scheduled for adjudication of APS’s water right claims. The adjudication court is currently conducting a trial of federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Hopi Tribe and by the United States as trustee for the Tribe. In addition, the adjudication court has established a schedule for consideration of separate federal reserved water right claims asserted by the Navajo Nation and by the United States as trustee for the Nation. There is no established timeframe within which the adjudication court is expected to issue a final determination of water rights for the Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation, and any such final determination is likely to occur multiple years in the future.
Although the above matters remain subject to further evaluation, APS does not expect that the described litigation will have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Human Capital
The Company seeks to attract the best employees, retain those employees, and create a safe, inclusive, and productive work environment for all employees. We believe the strength of our employees is one of the significant contributors to our Company’s success. Human capital measures and objectives that the Company focuses on in retaining its talent and managing its business include the safety of our employees, career development, diversity, equity and inclusion, succession planning, hiring, voluntary turnover, compensation, benefits, employee experience, and engagement.
Employee Safety
Our work and our decisions are anchored in safety – safety is the foundation of everything we do, and employee safety is our paramount responsibility as an employer. We develop safety practices and programs that ensure employees have safe and secure workplaces that allow them to perform at the highest levels. Our comprehensive safety programs and our focus on human and organizational performance and injury case management contribute significantly to our strong safety performance. As we continue to improve our safety performance, our ultimate goal remains serious injury reduction. Our employees are expected to do the right thing and are empowered to speak up when there are better or safer ways of doing business, including stopping work to reassess or improve safety. Safety committees operate in organizations throughout the Company, providing opportunities for employees to positively impact their local safety cultures and performance.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe that belonging matters. When we feel seen, heard, and valued, we can more effectively unite behind the APS Promise. Inclusion at the Company involves taking deliberate action to embrace the unique perspectives of each employee. We recognize that diversity of demographics, backgrounds and cultural perspective is a key driver for our success. Our internal diversity, equity, and inclusion team, supported by our Executive Diversity & Inclusion Council as well as other groups, leads this commitment with an emphasis on diversity among employees, in the workplace, and through our community involvement, as well as an increased focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent. This focus extends to individual business units in the Company, which report on the diversity of their teams during management review meetings to build awareness and address gaps of workforce diversity. 
Our efforts to support and empower employees include a commitment to full inclusion of all our people. We have a robust, multi-year strategy for diversity, equity, and inclusion that focuses on eleven key areas, both internally- and externally-facing. In 2021, APS received recognition as winner of the Inclusive Workplace Award from Diversity Leadership Alliance and Arizona Society of Human Resource Management. The award recognizes APS as an Arizona corporation that leads by example, creating an inclusive environment in which employees can be their genuine, authentic selves, and partners on community outreach efforts and support.
Each year since 2020, we have conducted company-wide executive listening sessions to provide employees with opportunities to be heard on their experiences at the Company. In 2019, we signed the UNITY Pledge in support of full inclusion and equality in employment, housing, and public 
accommodations for all Arizonans, including gay and transgender people. The UNITY Pledge reinforces our commitment to fostering an environment that recognizes our employees’ unique needs and celebrates the value of diverse perspectives. The Company sponsors ten employee network groups that are intended to create a sense of inclusion and belonging for employees.
We continue to focus on hiring diverse employees as well as hiring employees from our veteran community. During 2022, 44% of external hires were ethnically or racially diverse, 40% were female and 7% were veterans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, 35% of our employees are ethnically or racially diverse, 26% are female, and 15% are veterans. Finally, as of December 31, 2022, 39% of the Company’s officers are female, and 18% are ethnically or racially diverse.
Succession Planning
Through a strong focus on succession planning, we ensure that our Company is prepared to fill executive and other key leadership roles with capable, experienced employees. We continually revisit and revise succession plans to make certain that qualified individuals are in place to move into critical positions. We have strategically selected successors for our management team to lead our Company into the future with strong and sustainable performance. In addition, we assure that each business unit of the Company has talent management strategies and development plans to meet its future leadership needs. Effective succession planning helps us identify employees with leadership potential and also allows us to evaluate any gaps in education, skills and experience that need to be addressed to prepare those employees to move into leadership roles. At management review meetings, officers and directors review how business units are addressing succession planning, leadership opportunities, and retirement projections. 
Talent Strategy and Development
We place significant focus on attracting and developing a skilled workforce. To attract and retain top talent, we provide formal professional development programs through blended learning education and leadership training. Our employees have access to a wide variety of training and development opportunities, including leadership academies, rotational programs, mentoring programs, industry certifications, and loaned executive programs. In 2022, we graduated 138 individuals from our three academies (Leadership Academy, Impact and Influence Academy, and Strategic Leadership Academy). Additionally, our Learning and Development organization was recognized as a top training organization, earnings an APEX Award from Training Magazine.
Talent pipelines help sustain our skilled workforce needs. Pipeline strategies include our apprentice and rotational programs. Additionally, our recruiters target specific colleges and programs of study that we have identified as talent pipelines. In 2022, we hosted 54 summer interns with a diversity rate of 63%.
Total Rewards Strategy
In addition to our talent strategy, we place significant focus on our Total Rewards strategy for attracting, developing, and rewarding our highly skilled workforce. Our employees are important to the success and future of our organization and our customers’ experiences. At the Company, our pay and benefits, along with retirement, recognition, time off, career development and well-being, make up our Total Rewards program. It is an important part of the employee experience at the Company and supports 
personal well-being and professional satisfaction. We are committed to providing programs that matter to our employees throughout various life and career phases.
Employee Engagement
An annual employee experience survey and focused quarterly pulse-surveys, enable us to gather employee feedback, identify opportunities for improvement, and compare our performance to other companies. Through the surveys, we track our Employee Experience Index, a set of seven questions that encompass key elements of a positive employee experience, including recognition, career development possibilities, and pride in the organization. Based on survey results, business units and individual managers are encouraged to take meaningful actions to improve the employee experience. In response to past surveys, we have launched enterprise-wide initiatives focused on improving communication between employees and management as well as removing obstacles that prevent job success. Other initiatives driven by the survey have given employees more access to leadership and improved meeting efficiency. Our cross-functional Employee Engagement Council focuses on improving employee recognition across the organization. We work to ensure that a positive work environment is maintained for all employees. Through an outreach initiative, we obtain feedback from new hires regarding their employee experience. In 2019, we integrated our employee experience surveys with onboarding surveys and exit interviews. Bringing together these elements allows us to get a more complete picture of the experience of our employees, from the time they join the Company until they decide to leave.
Company Culture
In 2020, the Company launched the APS Promise, anchoring our commitment to our customers, community, and each other. The Promise explains our purpose, vision, and mission and the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals. It represents the opportunity to build on our cultural strengths and develop new behaviors to enable our future success.
BUSINESS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES
Bright Canyon Energy
On July 31, 2014, Pinnacle West announced its creation of a wholly-owned subsidiary, BCE.  BCE’s strategy is to develop, own, operate and acquire energy infrastructure in a manner that leverages the Company’s core expertise in the electric energy industry.  As of December 31, 2022, BCE had total assets of approximately $115.3 million.
In 2014, BCE formed a 50/50 joint venture with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  The joint venture, named TransCanyon, is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates. 
On December 20, 2019, BCE acquired minority ownership positions in two wind farms under development by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri (“Clear Creek”) and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota (“Nobles 2”). Clear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020 and Nobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020. Both wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs. BCE indirectly owns 9.9% of Clear Creek and 5.1% of Nobles 2.
Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC, the developer, owner, and operator of the Clear Creek wind farm, has disputed the proposed cost allocation of system upgrades related to connecting the Clear Creek wind farm to the transmission system and filed a complaint with FERC on May 21, 2021, which was denied on September 9, 2022. Subsequently, Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC filed with FERC a request for rehearing and a motion for stay of the September 9, 2022 order. On October 7, 2022, the request for rehearing was denied by FERC. FERC has not ruled on the motion for stay. Clear Creek has filed a Petition for Review with the U.S. Court of Appeals and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, both of which are still pending. 
Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC filed a second complaint with FERC on May 25, 2022, alleging that the wind farm was being curtailed in a discriminatory manner. The May 25, 2022 Complaint was denied by FERC on December 15, 2022 and Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC requested Rehearing of the denial on January 13, 2023. 
Due to the disputed system upgrades and the related curtailment, the Clear Creek wind farm has experienced a significant reduction in power generation that has had a material adverse impact on the project’s ability to generate cash flow for investors. These energy curtailments are expected to persist, unless and until system upgrades are implemented to alleviate the present transmission system congestion, or the disputes are determined in favor of, or settled in a manner favorable to, Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC. As such, during the fourth quarter of 2022, due to these on-going disputes, cost allocation uncertainties, and no probable favorable resolution, BCE determined its equity method investment was fully impaired. Prior to the impairment, the investment had a carrying value of $17.1 million, which has been written-down to reflect the investment’s estimated fair value of zero as of December 31, 2022. Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes an after-tax loss of $12.8 million relating to this impairment.
BCE has started construction on a microgrid facility in Los Alamitos, California (“Los Alamitos”) featuring 31 MW of solar, 20 MW of battery storage, and 3 MW of backup generators. Supported by a long-term PPA with San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Los Alamitos will supply 20 MW of solar and battery storage capacity to the Southern California grid and provide resilient backup power in the event of a grid emergency to the Army and California National Guard at Joint Forces Training Base Los Alamitos. The Los Alamitos project is scheduled to achieve commercial operation in third-quarter 2023. See Note 6 regarding a credit agreement entered into by BCE to finance capital expenditures and related costs for this microgrid project.
BCE and Ameresco, Inc. jointly own a special purpose entity that is sponsoring the Kūpono Solar project. This project is a 42 MW solar and battery storage facility in Oʻahu, Hawaii that will supply clean renewable energy and capacity under a 20-year PPA with Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. The Kūpono Solar project is expected to be completed in 2024.
El Dorado

El Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West. El Dorado owns debt investments and minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.  El Dorado is actively seeking to prudently realize the value of these investments.  In particular, El Dorado committed to a $25 million investment in the Energy Impact Partners fund, which is an organization that focuses on fostering innovation and supporting the transformation of the utility industry. The investment will be made by El Dorado as investments are selected by the Energy Impact Partners fund. As of December 31, 2022, El Dorado has contributed approximately $12.5 million to the Energy Impact Partners fund. Additionally, El Dorado committed to a $25 million investment in AZ-VC (formerly invisionAZ Fund), which is a fund focused on analyzing, investing, managing, and otherwise dealing with investments in privately-held early stage and emerging growth technology companies and businesses primarily based in the State of Arizona, or based in other jurisdictions and having existing or potential strategic or economic ties to companies or other interests in the State of Arizona. As of December 31, 2022, El Dorado has contributed approximately $2.6 million to the AZ-VC. The remainder of the investments will be contributed by El Dorado as investments are selected by the AZ-VC. 
Pinnacle West, APS and El Dorado are all incorporated in the State of Arizona.  BCE and 4CA are incorporated in Delaware. Additional information for each of these companies is provided below:
