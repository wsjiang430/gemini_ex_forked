Item 1.    Business

Overview
We are a leading retirement services company that issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. We generate attractive financial results for our policyholders and shareholders by combining our two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, generally illiquid liabilities and (2) investing in a high-quality investment portfolio, which takes advantage of the illiquid nature of our liabilities. Our steady and significant base of earnings generates capital that we opportunistically invest across our business to source attractively-priced liabilities and capitalize on opportunities. Our differentiated investment strategy benefits from our strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management, LLC (AGM, and together with its subsidiaries, Apollo) and its indirect subsidiary, AAM. AAM provides a full suite of services for our investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisition asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Our relationship with Apollo and AAM also provides us with access to Apollo’s investment professionals around the world as well as Apollo’s global asset management infrastructure across a broad array of asset classes. We are led by a highly skilled management team with extensive industry experience. We are based in Bermuda with our U.S. subsidiaries’ headquarters located in Iowa.
We began operating in 2009 when the burdens of the financial crisis and resulting capital demands caused many companies to exit the retirement market, creating the need for a well-capitalized company with an experienced management team to fill the void. Taking advantage of this market dislocation, we have been able to acquire substantial blocks of long-duration liabilities and reinvest the related investments to produce profitable returns.
We operate our core business strategies out of one reportable segment, Retirement Services. In addition to Retirement Services, we report certain other operations in Corporate and Other. Retirement Services is comprised of our U.S. and Bermuda operations, which issue and reinsure retirement savings products and institutional products. Retirement Services has retail operations, which provide annuity retirement solutions to our policyholders. Retirement Services also has reinsurance operations, which reinsure multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGA), fixed indexed annuities (FIA), traditional one year guarantee fixed deferred annuities, immediate annuities and institutional products from our reinsurance partners. In addition, our funding agreement activities and our pension risk transfer (PRT) operations are included in our Retirement Services segment. Corporate and Other includes certain other operations related to our corporate activities, including corporate allocated expenses, merger and acquisition costs, debt costs, certain integration and restructuring costs, certain stock-based compensation and intersegment eliminations. Additionally, prior to 2018, Corporate and Other included our former German operations. In Corporate and Other we also hold strategic capital in excess of the level of capital we hold in Retirement Services to support our operating strategy.
We believe we hold a sufficient amount of capital in our Retirement Services segment to support our core operating strategies. This level of capital reflects the level we believe is needed to support or improve our current ratings as well as our risk appetite based on our internal capital and risk models. Our excess capital is currently allocated to our Corporate non-reportable segment and may fluctuate depending on the mix of both our assets and our liabilities as well as our growth and investment in our organic and inorganic channels. We view this excess as strategic capital, which we expect to deploy for future growth opportunities. We further expect our excess capital position to contribute to ratings improvements over time. We manage our capital to levels which we believe would remain consistent with our current ratings in a recessionary environment.
We have developed organic and inorganic channels to address the retirement services market and grow our assets and liabilities. By focusing on the retirement services market, we believe that we will benefit from several demographic and economic trends, including the increasing number of retirees in the U.S., the lack of tax advantaged alternatives for people trying to save for retirement and expectations of a rising interest rate environment. To date, most of the products that we have sold or acquired have been fixed annuities, which offer people saving for retirement a product that is tax advantaged, has a minimum guaranteed rate of return or minimum cash value and provides protection against investment loss.
Within our organic channels, we have focused on developing a diverse suite of products that allow us to meet our risk and return profiles, even in today’s low rate environment. Our organic channels currently include: (1) retail, from which we provide retirement solutions to our policyholders primarily through independent marketing organizations (IMOs); (2) flow reinsurance, through which we partner with insurance companies to improve their product offerings and enhance their financial results; and (3) institutional, which includes funding agreements and PRT transactions. Our inorganic channel, acquisitions and block reinsurance, has contributed significantly to our growth, and we expect that it will continue to be an important source of growth in the future. We believe our internal transactions team, with support from Apollo, has an industry-leading ability to source, underwrite and expeditiously close transactions, which makes us a competitive counterparty for acquisitions and block reinsurance transactions. In conjunction with Apollo, we are able to provide bespoke solutions to insurance companies seeking to restructure their businesses. We are highly selective in the transactions we pursue, ultimately closing only those that are well aligned with our core competencies and pricing discipline.
We intend to maintain a presence within each of our distribution channels. However, we do not have any market share targets across our organization, which we believe provides us flexibility to respond to changing market conditions in one or more channels and to opportunistically grow liabilities that generate our desired levels of profitability. In a rising interest rate environment, we believe we will be able to profitably increase the volumes generated through our organic channels, while more challenging market environments may give rise to increased growth opportunities through our inorganic channel.

Item 1.    Business

Through our efficient corporate structure and operations, we believe we have built a cost-effective platform to support our growth opportunities. We believe our fixed operating cost structure supports our ability to maintain an attractive financial profile across market environments. Additionally, we believe we have designed our platform to be highly scalable and support growth without significant incremental investment in infrastructure, which allows us to scale our business production up or down to meet demand for our products and services. As a result, we believe we will be able to convert a significant portion of our new business spread into adjusted operating income.
Relationship with Apollo
We have a strategic relationship with Apollo which allows us to leverage the scale of its asset management platform. Apollo’s indirect subsidiary, AAM, serves as our investment manager. In addition to co-founding the Company, Apollo assists us in identifying and capitalizing on acquisition opportunities that have been critical to our ability to significantly grow our business. The Apollo Group consists of (1) AGM, (2) the AAA Guarantor – Athene, L.P. (AAA Investor), (3) any investment fund or other collective investment vehicle whose general partner or managing member is owned, directly or indirectly, by AGM or one or more of AGM’s subsidiaries, (4) BRH Holdings GP, Ltd. and its shareholders and (5) any executive officer of AGM whom AGM designates, in a written notice delivered to Athene, as a member of the Apollo Group for purposes of AHL’s Bye-laws (which designation shall continue in effect until such designee ceases to be an executive officer of AGM) and (6) any affiliate of a person described in clauses (1) through (5) above; provided none of AHL or its subsidiaries, nor any person employed by AHL, its subsidiaries or AAM shall be deemed to be a member of the Apollo Group. For avoidance of doubt, any person managed by AGM or by one or more of AGM’s subsidiaries pursuant to a managed account agreement (or similar arrangement) without AGM or by one or more of AGM’s subsidiaries controlling such person as a general partner or managing member shall not be part of the Apollo Group. Members of the Apollo Group are significant owners of our common shares and Apollo employees serve on our board of directors. We expect our strategic relationship with Apollo to continue for the foreseeable future. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.
The Apollo Group controls and is expected to continue to control 45% of the total voting power of AHL and six of our fifteen directors are employees of or consultants to Apollo, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer who is a dual employee of both AHL and AAM. Further, our bye-laws generally limit the voting power of our Class A common shares (and certain other of our voting securities) such that no person owns (or is treated as owning) more than 9.9% of the total voting power of our common shares (with certain exceptions). See Item 1A. Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Investment in Our Class A Common Shares–The interest of the Apollo Group, which controls and is expected to continue to control 45% of the total voting power of AHL and holds a number of the seats on our board of directors, may conflict with those of other shareholders and could make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions.
Growth Strategy
The key components of our growth strategy are as follows:

• | Expand Our Organic Distribution Channels. We plan to grow organically by expanding our retail, flow reinsurance and institutional distribution channels. We expect our retail channel to continue to benefit from our improving credit profile, strong financial position, suite of capital efficient products and product design capabilities. We believe this should support growth in sales at our desired cost of crediting through increased volumes in each of our existing retail channels, including via expanding our small to mid-sized bank and broker-dealer network, and increased volumes via access to new channels. We continue to implement the necessary technology platform, hire and train a specialized sales force, and have created products to capture new potential distribution opportunities.

Within our flow reinsurance channel, we target reinsurance business consistent with our preferred liability characteristics, and as such, flow reinsurance provides another opportunistic channel for us to source long-term liabilities with attractive crediting rates. We expect our improving credit profile and growing reputation as a reliable reinsurance counterparty will enable us to attract additional flow reinsurance partners.
We expect to grow our institutional channel by continuing to engage in opportunistic issuances of funding agreements and pursuing additional PRT transactions. We believe that our demonstrated ability to create customized solutions for PRT counterparties seeking to reduce or eliminate their exposure to pension obligations will continue to drive the positive momentum that we have seen in this channel.

• | Pursue Attractive Inorganic Growth Opportunities. We plan to continue leveraging our expertise in sourcing and evaluating inorganic transactions to grow our business profitably. From our founding through December 31, 2018, we have grown to total assets of $125.5 billion, primarily through acquisitions and block reinsurance transactions. We believe that our demonstrated ability to successfully consummate complex transactions, as well as our relationship with Apollo, provides us with distinct advantages relative to other acquirers and block reinsurance counterparties. Furthermore, we have achieved sufficient scale to provide meaningful operational synergies for the businesses and blocks of business that we acquire and reinsure, respectively. Consequently, we believe we are often sought out by companies looking to restructure their businesses.

• | Expand Our Product Offering. We seek to build products that meet our policyholders’ retirement savings objectives, such as accumulation, income and legacy planning. Our products are customized for each of the retail channels through which we distribute, including IMOs, banks and independent broker dealers, and represent innovative solutions that meet the needs of policyholders in each of these channels. In furtherance of our objective to provide innovative solutions to policyholders, we recently launched several new products, including Agility, a no-fee product that offers lifetime income; Protector, an accumulation product with a “return of premium” feature designed to appeal to the bank channel; and products linked to a unique equity strategy that maximizes exposure to the equity market. We will continue to supplement our product offerings to ensure that we are able to provide comprehensive solutions to those within the retirement savings market. Currently, we are developing a single purchase payment index-linked deferred annuity product that will permit policyholders to participate in increases in equity market indices to a greater degree than what is available within our current product portfolio, in exchange for limited risk of loss to principal due to decreases in such equity market indices. Unlike more traditional deferred annuities, this product will be registered under the Securities Act and will therefore only be distributed through registered financial representatives, broker dealers and banks. We currently expect that this product will be available in mid-2019. The foregoing does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security of AHL or any of its subsidiaries.


• | Leverage Our Unique Relationship with Apollo and AAM. We intend to continue leveraging our unique relationship with Apollo and AAM to source high-quality assets with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Apollo’s global scale and reach provide us with broad market access across environments and geographies and allow us to actively source assets that exhibit our preferred risk and return characteristics. For instance, through our relationship with Apollo and AAM, we have indirectly invested in companies including MidCap FinCo Limited (MidCap) and AmeriHome Mortgage Company, LLC (AmeriHome). See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Consolidated Investment Portfolio–Alternative Investments for further discussion of MidCap and AmeriHome.

Our relationship with Apollo also allows us to offer creative solutions to insurance companies seeking to restructure their businesses and may enable us source additional volumes of attractively-priced liabilities. For example, in December 2017 a consortium of investors, led by affiliates of Apollo, and certain other investors including us, agreed to purchase Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (VIAC), including its closed block variable annuity segment. In connection with this transaction, we reinsured $19 billion of fixed annuities. These transactions provided Voya Financial, Inc. (Voya) with a comprehensive solution to its variable annuity exposure, while providing us with a substantial block of fixed annuities, which are well aligned with our core business, without requiring that we acquire Voya’s variable annuity business.

• | Allocate Assets during Market Dislocations. As we have done successfully in the past, we plan to fully capitalize on future market dislocations to opportunistically reposition our portfolio to capture incremental yield. For example, regulatory changes in the wake of the financial crisis have made it more expensive for banks and other traditional lenders to hold certain illiquid and complex assets, notwithstanding the fact that these assets may have prudent credit characteristics. The repressed demand for these asset classes has provided opportunities for investors to acquire high-quality assets that offer attractive returns. For example, we see emerging opportunities as banks retreat from direct mortgage lending, structured and asset-backed products, and middle-market commercial loans. We intend to maintain a flexible approach to asset allocation, which will allow us to act quickly on similar opportunities that may arise in the future across a wide variety of asset types.


• | Maintain Risk Management Discipline. Our risk management strategy is to proactively manage our exposure to risks associated with interest rate duration, credit risk and structural complexity of our invested assets. We address interest rate duration and liquidity risks by managing the duration of the liabilities we source with the assets we acquire through asset liability management (ALM) modeling. We assess credit risk by modeling our liquidity and capital under a range of stress scenarios. We manage the risks related to the structural complexity of our invested assets through AAM’s modeling efforts. The goal of our risk management discipline is to be able to continue to grow and achieve profitable results across various market environments.

Products
We principally offer two product lines: annuities and funding agreements. Our primary product line is annuities and includes fixed, payout and group annuities issued in connection with PRT transactions. We also offer funding agreements, including those issued to institutions and to a special-purpose unaffiliated trust in connection with our funding agreement backed notes (FABN) program. The following summarizes our total premiums and deposits by product:

German products | — | | | 203 | | | 212 
Total premiums and deposits, net of ceded | $ | 40,031 | | | $ | 12,011 | | $ | 9,258

Total premiums and deposits are comprised of all products deposits, which generally are not included in revenues on the consolidated statements of income, and premiums collected. Total premiums and deposits include directly written business, flow reinsurance assumed as well as premiums and deposits generated from assumed block reinsurance transactions, net of those ceded through reinsurance. Organic and inorganic deposits do not correspond to the total premiums and deposits presented above as total premiums and deposits includes renewal deposits, annuitizations, as well as premiums and deposits from life and other products other than deferred annuities and institutional products, all of which are not included in our organic deposits.
Reserve liabilities represents our policyholder liability obligations, including liabilities assumed through reinsurance and net of liabilities ceded through reinsurance, and therefore does not correspond to interest sensitive contract liabilities, future policy benefits, dividends payable to policyholders and other policy claims and benefits as disclosed on our consolidated balance sheets. Reserve liabilities includes the reserves related to assumed modified coinsurance (modco) and funds withheld agreements to encompass the liabilities for which costs are being recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Reserve liabilities is net of the ceded liabilities to third-party reinsurers as the costs of those liabilities are passed to such reinsurers and, therefore, we have no net economic exposure to such liabilities, assuming our reinsurance counterparties perform under our agreements. The majority of our ceded reinsurance is a result of reinsuring large blocks of life business following acquisitions.
The following summarizes our reserve liabilities by product:

 | December 31,

Annuities
We offer deferred and payout annuities, which are focused on meeting the needs and objectives of people preparing for, approaching or living in retirement. The combination of financial strength, innovative product design and an effective sales strategy enables us to compete successfully in the market and meet the evolving needs of the rapidly growing population of retirees.
Fixed Indexed Annuities
The majority of our reserve liabilities are FIAs. An FIA is a type of insurance contract in which the policyholder makes one or more premium deposits which earn interest, on a tax deferred basis, at a crediting rate based on a specified market index. The policyholder is entitled to receive periodic or lump sum payments a specified number of years after the contract is issued. FIAs allow policyholders the possibility of earning interest without significant risk to principal, unless the contract is surrendered during a surrender charge period. A market index tracks the performance of a specific group of stocks or other assets representing a particular segment of the market, or in some cases, an entire market. Our FIAs include a provision for a minimum guaranteed surrender value calculated in accordance with applicable law, as well as death benefits as required by non-forfeiture regulations. We generally buy options on the indices to which the FIAs are tied to hedge the associated market risk. The cost of the option is priced into the overall economics of the product as an option budget.
The value to the policyholder of an FIA contract is equal to the sum of premiums paid, premium bonuses, if any, and index credits based on the change in the relevant market index, subject to a cap (a maximum rate that may be credited), spread (a credited rate determined by deducting a specific rate from the index return) and/or a participation rate (a credited rate equal to a percentage of the index return), less any fees for riders. Caps on our FIA products generally range from 2.0% to 6.0% when measured annually and 0.5% to 2.5% when measured monthly. Participation rates generally range from 25% to 150% of the performance of the applicable market index. Caps, spreads and participation rates can typically be reset no more frequently than annually, and in some instances no more frequently than every two to four years, at the relevant U.S. insurance subsidiary’s discretion, subject to stated policy minimums. Certain riders provide a variety of benefits, such as lifetime income or additional liquidity, for a set charge. As this charge is fixed, the policyholder may lose principal if the index credits received do not exceed the amount of such charge.
We generate income on FIA products by earning an investment margin, which is based on the difference between (1) income earned on the investments supporting the liabilities and (2) the interest credited to customers and the cost of providing guarantees (net of rider fees).
Fixed Rate Annuities
Fixed rate annuities include annual reset annuities and MYGAs. Unlike FIAs, fixed rate annuities earn interest at a set rate (or declared crediting rate), rather than a rate that may vary based on an index. Fixed rate annual reset annuities have a crediting rate that is typically guaranteed for one year. After such period, we have the ability to change the crediting rate at our discretion, generally once annually, to any rate at or above a guaranteed minimum rate. MYGAs are similar to annual reset annuities except that the initial crediting rate is guaranteed for a specified number of years, rather than just one year, before it may be changed at our discretion. As of December 31, 2018, crediting rates on outstanding annual reset annuities ranged from 1% to 8% and crediting rates on outstanding MYGAs ranged from 1% to 7%. As of December 31, 2018, 47% of our fixed rate annuities were set at the guaranteed minimum crediting rate.
Income Riders to Fixed Annuity Products
We broadly characterize the income riders on our deferred annuities as either guaranteed or participating. Guaranteed income riders provide policyholders with a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB), the amount of which is determined based upon the age of the policyholder when the policy is purchased and when the lifetime income is elected. Riders providing GLWB features permit policyholders to elect to receive guaranteed payments for life from their contract without having to annuitize their policies, which provides policyholders with greater flexibility in the future. Participating income riders tend to have lower levels of guaranteed income than guaranteed income riders, but provide policyholders the opportunity to receive greater levels of income if the policies’ indexed crediting strategies perform well. 
Income riders, particularly on FIAs, have become very popular among policyholders. The Life Insurance and Market Research Association (LIMRA) estimates that 54% of FIA premium for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 (the most recent period that specific market share data is currently available) included an income rider. Much of our in-force block of deferred annuities contains policies with income riders, which were sourced through retail and reinsurance operations as well as acquisitions, such as the substantial block of these policies acquired with Aviva USA Corporation (Aviva USA). Many of our in-force deferred annuities contain policies that provide GLWB. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 41% of our deferred annuities account value have rider benefits and the reserve associated with the rider benefits was 8.3% of the related account value. Of the deferred annuities sourced through our retail and flow reinsurance channels, for the year ended December 31, 2018, 12% contained participating income riders and 15% contained guaranteed income riders.

Item 1.    Business

Withdrawal Options for Deferred Annuities
After the first year following the issuance of a deferred annuity, the policyholder is typically permitted to make withdrawals up to 5% or 10% (depending on the contract) of the prior year’s value without a surrender charge or market value adjustment (MVA), subject to certain limitations. Withdrawals in excess of the allowable amounts are assessed a surrender charge and MVA if such withdrawals are made during the surrender charge period of the policy. The surrender charge of most of our products is typically between 7% and 20% of the contract value at contract inception and generally decreases by approximately one percentage point per year during the surrender charge period. The surrender charge period of our most popular products ranges from 3 to 20 years. The average surrender charge (excluding the impact of MVAs) is 6% for our deferred annuities as of December 31, 2018.
At maturity, the policyholder may elect to receive proceeds in the form of a single payment or an annuity. If the annuity option is selected, the policyholder will receive a series of payments either over the policyholder’s lifetime or over a fixed number of years, depending upon the terms of the contract. Some contracts permit annuitization prior to maturity. In addition to the foregoing rights, a policyholder may also elect to purchase a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider which provides the policyholder with a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit for the life of the contract.
Payout Annuities
Payout annuities primarily consist of single premium immediate annuities (SPIA), supplemental contracts and structured settlements. Payout annuities provide a series of periodic payments for a fixed period of time or for the life of the policyholder, based upon the policyholder’s election at the time of issuance. The amounts, frequency and length of time of the payments are fixed at the outset of the annuity contract. SPIAs are often purchased by persons at or near retirement age who desire a steady stream of payments over a future period of years. Supplemental contracts are typically created upon the conversion of a death claim or the annuitization of a deferred annuity. Structured settlements generally relate to legal settlements.
Group Annuities
PRT transactions usually involve a single premium group annuity contract issued for discharging certain pension plan liabilities. Our group annuities are nonparticipating contracts. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract may be held in a separate account. The group annuity benefits may be purchased for current, retired and/or terminated employees and their beneficiaries covered under terminating or ongoing pension plans. Both immediate and deferred annuities may be purchased by a single premium at issue. Immediate annuities cover those retirees and beneficiaries currently receiving payments, whereas deferred annuities cover those participants who have not yet begun receiving benefit payments. Immediate annuities have no cash surrender rights, whereas deferred annuities may include an election to receive a lump sum payment, exercisable by the participant upon either the participant achieving a specified age or the occurrence of a specified event, such as termination of the participant’s employment.
A PRT transaction may be structured as a buyout or buy-in transaction. A buyout transaction involves the issuance by an insurer of a group annuity contract to the plan sponsor and individual annuity certificates to each plan participant, resulting in the transfer of the contractual obligation to pay pension benefits from the plan sponsor to the insurer. A buyout transaction may be a full buyout or a partial buyout. A full buyout covers all obligations outstanding under the plan and involves the termination of the plan, whereas, a partial buyout covers benefits for a subset of the plan population with the remaining plan participants continuing with the plan sponsor and may or may not involve a plan termination. A buy-in similarly involves the issuance of a group annuity contract to the plan sponsor, but the plan sponsor retains the contractual obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan participants and receives reimbursement from the insurer for those payments related to plan participants covered by the group annuity contract. The buy-in group annuity contract is considered a plan asset. PRT transactions that are structured as buy-ins have an option to convert to buyout at the election of the plan sponsor. Generally, a buy-in structure is selected when the plan sponsor seeks to eliminate risk but is not yet prepared to terminate the plan or recognize any adverse accounting impact that may accompany a plan termination. A buy-in contract may be surrendered at the election of the plan sponsor, subject to certain conditions, resulting in a refund of the group annuity premium less a penalty.
We earn income on group annuities based upon the spread between the return on the assets received in connection with the PRT transaction and the cost of the pension obligations assumed. Group annuities expose us to longevity risk, which would be realized if plan participants live longer than assumed in underwriting the transaction, resulting in aggregate payments exceeding our expectations.
Funding Agreements
We focus on opportunistically issuing funding agreements at attractive risk-adjusted funding costs to institutional investors. Funding agreements are negotiated privately between an investor and an insurance company. They are designed to provide an agreement holder with a guaranteed return of principal and periodic interest payments, while offering competitive yields and predictable returns. The interest rate can be fixed or floating. If the interest rate is a floating rate, it may be linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the federal funds rate or other major index. See Item 1A. Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Our Business–Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and may further affect our ability to issue funding agreements bearing a floating rate of interest.

Life and Other (Excluding German Products)
Life and other products include other retail products, including run-off or ceded business, statutory closed blocks and ceded life insurance.
German Products
Prior to the deconsolidation of Athora Holding Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Athora) as discussed below, German products included annuity, life insurance and unit-linked products. The primary German product type was endowment policies, which were traditional German life insurance policies that included legally guaranteed interest, the right of policyholders to participate in certain portions of results and a death benefit.
Athora Deconsolidation
Prior to January 1, 2018, Athora was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AHL. In order to fully capitalize on the opportunity presented by the European market, Athora raised capital as part of a private offering of its equity securities. In April 2017, Athora entered into subscription agreements pursuant to which Athora secured commitments to purchase new common shares in Athora (Athora Offering). On January 1, 2018, the Athora Offering closed and Athora called capital from all of its investors, excluding us. In connection with the closing of Athora Offering, our equity interest in Athora was exchanged for new common shares of Athora and our interest in Athora was reduced. As of December 31, 2018, we held 10% of the aggregate voting power of and 23% of the economic interest in Athora. Our interest in Athora is held as a related party investment rather than as a consolidated subsidiary. 
In order to align our interests with those of Athora, in connection with the closing of the Athora Offering, we entered into a cooperation agreement with Athora, pursuant to which, among other things, (1) we have the right to reinsure approximately 20% of the spread business written or reinsured by any insurance or reinsurance company owned or acquired by Athora, (2) Athora’s insurance subsidiaries are required to purchase certain funding agreements and/or other spread instruments issued by our insurance subsidiaries, (3) we provide Athora with a right of first refusal to pursue acquisition and reinsurance transactions in Europe (other than the United Kingdom (UK)) and (4) Athora provides us and our subsidiaries with a right of first refusal to pursue acquisition and reinsurance transactions in North America and the UK.
Distribution Channels
We have developed four dedicated distribution channels: retail, flow reinsurance, institutional and acquisitions and block reinsurance, which support opportunistic origination across differing market environments and which we believe enable us to achieve stable asset growth while maintaining attractive returns.
We are diligent in setting our return targets based on market conditions and risks inherent to our products offered and acquisitions or block reinsurance transactions. Generally, we target mid-teen returns for sources of organic growth and mid-teen or higher returns for sources of inorganic growth. However, specific return targets are established with due consideration to the facts and circumstances surrounding each growth opportunity and may be higher or lower than those that we target more generally. Factors that we consider in establishing return targets for a given growth opportunity include, but are not limited to, the certainty of the return profile, the strategic nature of the opportunity, the size and scale of the opportunity, the alignment and fit of the opportunity with our existing business, the opportunity for risk diversification and the existence of increased opportunities for higher returns or growth. If market conditions or risks inherent in a product or transaction create return profiles that are not acceptable to us, we generally will not sacrifice our profitability merely to facilitate growth.
Retail
We have built a scalable platform that allows us to originate and rapidly grow our business in fixed annuity products despite today’s low interest rate environment. We have developed a suite of retirement savings products, distributed through our network of approximately 55 IMOs; more than 36,000 independent agents in all 50 states; and our growing network of nine small and mid-sized banks and 75 regional broker-dealers. We are focused in every aspect of our retail channel on providing high quality products and service to our policyholders and maintaining appropriate financial protection over the life of their policies.
Flow Reinsurance
Reinsurance is an arrangement under which an insurance company, the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance company, the ceding company or cedant, for all or a portion of the insurance risks underwritten by the ceding company. Reinsurance is designed to (1) reduce the net amount at risk on individual risks, thereby enabling the ceding company to increase the volume of business it can underwrite, as well as increase the maximum risk it can underwrite on a single risk, (2) stabilize operating results by reducing volatility in the ceding company’s loss experience, (3) assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory requirements and (4) enhance the ceding company’s financial strength and surplus position.

Item 1.    Business

We conduct the majority of our third-party reinsurance transactions through our subsidiary, Athene Life Re Ltd. (ALRe). ALRe is licensed as a Class E insurer carrying on long-term business in Bermuda; one of the largest reinsurance markets in the world by reserves, with a regulatory regime deemed equivalent to the European Union’s Directive (2009/138/EC) (Solvency II) for commercial insurers. As a fixed annuity reinsurer, ALRe partners with life and annuity insurance companies to develop solutions to their capital requirements, enhance their presence in the retirement market and improve their financial results. The specific liabilities ALRe targets to reinsure include FIAs, MYGAs, traditional one-year guarantee fixed deferred annuities, immediate annuities and institutional products. ALRe only targets business consistent with our preferred liability characteristics, and as such, reinsurance provides another opportunistic channel for us to source long-term liabilities with attractive crediting rates. For various transaction-related reasons, from time to time, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, in particular Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company (AADE), will reinsure business from third-party ceding companies. In these instances, the respective U.S. insurance subsidiary will generally retrocede a portion of the reinsured business to Athene Annuity Re, Ltd. (AARe) or ALRe (collectively, our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries).
Since inception, we have been involved in reinsurance and retrocession transactions with 23 third-party cedants. As of December 31, 2018, we had on-going flow reinsurance and retrocession agreements involving 11 third-party cedants, for a quota share of such cedants’ new deposits, including both FIAs and MYGAs.
Institutional
Funding Agreements
We participate in an FABN program, which is a medium-term note program under which funding agreements are issued to a special-purpose trust that issues marketable notes. The notes are underwritten and marketed by major investment banks’ broker-dealer operations and are sold to institutional investors. The proceeds of the issuance of notes are used by the trust to acquire a funding agreement from us with matching interest and maturity payment terms. We are also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and we have issued funding agreements to the FHLB in exchange for cash advances. The following represents the aggregate principal amount of funding agreement deposits:

 | Years ended December 31,
(In millions) | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
FABN | $ | — | | | $ | 2,750 | | $ | —
FHLB | 650 | | | 250 | | | —
Total funding agreement deposits | $ | 650 | | | $ | 3,000 | | $ | —

As of December 31, 2018, we had funding agreements of $2.7 billion outstanding under our FABN program and $926 million outstanding with the FHLB.
Pension Risk Transfer
Through PRT, we partner with institutions seeking to transfer and thereby reduce their obligation to pay future pension benefits to retirees and deferred participants. We have built an experienced team and continue to enhance our capabilities in this channel by, among other things, expanding into the deferred liability segment and offering a buy-in product. We work with advisors, brokers and consultants to source PRT transactions and design solutions that meet the needs of prospective PRT counterparties. We are focused on medium- and large-sized deals involving retirees and/or deferred participants that are structured as either a buyout or a buy-in transaction. We entered this channel during 2017 and from our entry through the year ended December 31, 2018, we had closed 11 deals involving more than 92,000 plan participants resulting in the issuance of group annuities in the aggregate principal amount of $4.8 billion. 
We believe we have established ourselves as a trusted PRT solutions provider and expect that our experience in crafting customized PRT solutions and our improving credit profile will enable us to continue to source and execute PRT transactions. Our ability to design tailored solutions that meet the needs of our PRT counterparties was highlighted in our landmark transaction with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Bristol-Myers). Pursuant to that transaction, we provided Bristol-Myers with an innovative solution to facilitate the complete termination of its pension plan. In connection with the transaction, we agreed to provide a group annuity contract covering all obligations that remain after certain plan participants are permitted to elect to receive a lump sum payment in July 2019. The group annuity contract will cover up to $3.8 billion of remaining pension liabilities. The transaction is expected to close in August 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.
Acquisitions and Block Reinsurance
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are an important source of growth in our business. We have a proven ability to acquire businesses in complex transactions at terms favorable to us, manage the liabilities that we acquire and reinvest the associated assets. Through December 31, 2018, we have closed four acquisition transactions in the U.S.: Liberty Life Insurance Corporation (Liberty Life), Investors Insurance Corporation, Presidential Life Corporation and Aviva USA; and one international acquisition, Delta Lloyd Deutschland AG (DLD), collectively representing reserve liabilities backed by approximately $65.9 billion in total assets (net of $9.3 billion in assets ceded through reinsurance).
15

Item 1.    Business

The acquisition of Aviva USA marked a significant milestone in our history. As a result of the acquisition we grew to approximately four times our size immediately prior to the acquisition (as measured by total assets). The acquisition significantly enhanced our retail channel, increased our scale, improved our infrastructure and further demonstrated our integration abilities, in this case having successfully integrated a company with a significantly larger employee headcount and IT and operational footprint.
We plan to continue leveraging our expertise in sourcing and evaluating transactions to profitably grow our business. We believe our demonstrated ability to source transactions, consummate complex transactions and reinvest assets into higher yielding investments as well as our relationship with Apollo provides us with distinct advantages relative to other acquirers.
In general, we seek to reinsure or otherwise dispose of those portions of the target company’s business that we do not wish to retain, if any. Our largest reinsurance agreements ceding the obligations of such businesses are described below.
Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (Global Atlantic) – As part of our acquisition of Aviva USA, we transferred the risk of substantially all of Aviva USA’s life insurance business by reinsuring such business to Accordia Life and Annuity Company (Accordia) and First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company (FAFLIC), each a subsidiary of Global Atlantic. The transfer of such risk was achieved through entry into a combination of coinsurance and funds withheld agreements with Accordia and FAFLIC. We have outstanding obligations ceded under the coinsurance agreements with Accordia, which remain unnovated, of $2.7 billion of statutory reserves as of December 31, 2018. Accordia maintains a custody account and a trust account under these agreements or related retrocession agreements, with assets equal to or greater than an agreed-upon required statutory balance that, as of December 31, 2018, was $2.5 billion and $655 million, respectively.
Pursuant to the terms of the funds withheld agreement with FAFLIC, Athene Life Insurance Company of New York (ALICNY) maintains a funds withheld account with an agreed-upon statutory balance that as of December 31, 2018 was $277 million. Pursuant to the terms of the coinsurance agreements, FAFLIC maintains trust accounts with agreed-upon required statutory balances that, as of December 31, 2018, was $804 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding obligations ceded pursuant to the FAFLIC reinsurance agreements amounted to $1,305 million in statutory reserves.
We continue to have the primary legal obligation to satisfy claims and obligations relating to those policies not novated to Accordia or FAFLIC. As a consequence, if Accordia or FAFLIC were unable to satisfy its reinsurance obligations on such life policies, we would be responsible for satisfying those contractual obligations reinsured by Accordia or FAFLIC, respectively. We do not maintain a security interest in the custody account discussed above, and therefore in the event of an Accordia insolvency, the assets of the custody account may be available to satisfy the claims of Accordia’s general creditors. In addition, in the event of an Accordia insolvency, our claims against Accordia would be subordinated to those of its policyholders. As of December 31, 2018, both Accordia and FAFLIC were rated A by A.M. Best Rating Services, Inc. (A.M. Best).
Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective) – On April 29, 2011, AADE ceded substantially all of its life and health business to Protective under a coinsurance agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the statutory book value of assets in the trust backing Protective’s obligations under the coinsurance agreement was $1.4 billion and the outstanding obligations ceded pursuant to the arrangement amounted to $1.4 billion. In the event that Protective is unable to satisfy its reinsurance obligations with respect to the policies ceded and the trust assets prove insufficient to satisfy the resulting obligations, we would have the primary legal obligation to satisfy such deficiency. In the event of a Protective insolvency, our claim against Protective would be subordinated to those of its policyholders. As of December 31, 2018, Protective was rated A+ by A.M. Best.
Block Reinsurance
Through block reinsurance transactions, we partner with life and annuity companies to decrease their exposure to one or more products or to divest of lower-margin or non-core segments of their businesses. Unlike acquisitions in which we must acquire the assets or stock of a target company, block reinsurance allows us to contractually assume assets and liabilities associated with a certain book of business. In doing so, we contractually assume responsibility for only that portion of the business that we deem desirable, without assuming additional liabilities. The benefit of the block reinsurance structure was highlighted in the transaction with Voya, pursuant to which we reinsured $19 billion in fixed annuities without assuming any of Voya’s variable annuities.
Investment Management
Investment activities are an integral part of our business and our net investment income is a significant component of our total revenues. Our investment philosophy is to invest a portion of our assets in securities that earn us incremental yield by taking liquidity risk and complexity risk and capitalizing on our long-dated and persistent liability profile to prudently achieve higher net investment earned rates, rather than assuming solely credit risk. Because we have remained disciplined in underwriting attractively priced liabilities, we have the ability to invest in a broad range of high quality assets to generate attractive earnings.
16

Item 1.    Business

Our differentiated investment strategy benefits from our strategic relationship with Apollo and its indirect subsidiary, AAM. AAM provides a full suite of services for our investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisition asset diligence and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. AAM provides portfolio management services for substantially all of our invested assets. As of December 31, 2018, of the total assets AAM managed, 82% were direct asset selection and 18% were indirect through sub-advising to Apollo and its affiliates, in order to access additional sourcing and underwriting capabilities. Substantially all of our assets subject to a sub-advisory arrangement are sub-advised by Apollo affiliates. AAM allocates portions of our asset portfolio to sub-advisors to manage based on market opportunities.
We are downside focused and our asset allocations reflect the results of stress testing. Additionally, we establish risk thresholds which in turn define risk tolerance across a wide range of factors, including credit risk, liquidity risk, concentration risk and caps on specific asset classes. We protect against rising interest rates, as our assets are generally shorter in effective duration than our liabilities, resulting in a risk profile that we believe could sustain substantial increases in interest rates over and above what is implied by current futures markets without sustaining net losses.
AAM’s investment team and Apollo’s credit portfolio managers employ their deep experience to assist us in sourcing and underwriting complex asset classes. AAM has selected a diverse array of corporate bonds and more structured, but highly rated, asset classes. We also maintain holdings in floating rate and less interest rate-sensitive investments, including collateralized loan obligations (CLO), non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and various types of structured products. These asset classes permit us to earn incremental yield by assuming liquidity risk and complexity risk, rather than assuming solely credit risk.
In addition to our core fixed income portfolio, we opportunistically allocate 5–10% of our portfolio to alternative investments where we primarily focus on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments. Our alternative investment strategy is inherently opportunistic rather than being derived from allocating a fixed percentage of assets to the asset class and the strategy is subject to internal concentration limits. Individual alternative investments are selected based on the investment’s risk-reward profile, incremental effect on diversification and potential for attractive returns due to sector and/or market dislocations. We have a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments that constitute a direct investment or an investment in a fund with a high degree of co-investment; (2) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (3) investments that have less downside risk. In general, we target returns for alternative investments of 10% or higher on an internal rate of return basis over the expected lives of such investments.
Our asset portfolio is managed within the limits and constraints set forth in our Investment and Credit Risk Policy. Under this policy, we set limits on investments in our portfolio by asset class, such as corporate bonds, emerging markets securities, municipal bonds, non-agency RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), CLO, commercial mortgage whole loans and mezzanine loans and alternative investments. We also set credit risk limits for exposure to a single issuer that vary based on ratings. In addition, our asset portfolio is constrained by its scenario-based capital ratio limit and its stressed liquidity limit.
Outsourcing
With regard to our U.S. business, we outsource some portion or all of each of the following functions to third-party service providers:

• | hosting of financial systems;


• | service of existing policies;


• | custody;


• | policy administration;


• | information technology development and maintenance;


• | investment management; and


• | call centers.

We closely manage our outsourcing partners and integrate their services into our operations. We believe that outsourcing such functions allows us to focus capital and our employees on our core business operations and perform higher utility functions, such as actuarial, product development and risk management. In addition, we believe an outsourcing model provides predictable pricing, service levels and volume capabilities and allows us to benefit from technological developments that enhance our customer self-service and sales processes that we would not otherwise be able to implement without reinvesting more of our own capital.
For our retail annuity business, all aspects of new business, including call centers and in-force administration is handled in-house. For some closed in-force blocks of business we partner with Alliance – One Services, Inc., Concentrix Insurance Administrative Solutions Corporation and Infosys McCamish Systems, LLC to provide policy administration services. For annuities issued in support of PRT transactions, we partner with Conduent Health Administration Inc. and Alight Administration Solutions LLC to provide administration services. For information technology services, we use some providers for managed services or supplemental labor, including Tata Consulting Services Limited and UST Global Inc., and for data center, infrastructure and related services we use a combination of OneNeck (a TDS company) for hosting and UST Global Inc. for managed services. For investment management services, we use AAM and Apollo. We believe we have a good relationship with our principal outsource service providers.

Item 1.    Business

Hedging Program and Derivatives
We use, and may continue to use, derivatives, including swaps, options, futures and forward contracts, and reinsurance contracts to hedge risks such as current or future changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities, current or future changes in cash flows, changes in interest rates, equity markets, currency fluctuations and changes in longevity. Our hedging program is focused on hedging our economic risk exposures. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information regarding the risks to which we are subject and the strategies that we employ to manage those risks.
Financial Strength Ratings
Financial strength and credit ratings directly affect our ability to access funding and the related cost of borrowing, the attractiveness of certain of our products to customers, our attractiveness as a reinsurer to potential ceding companies and requirements for derivatives collateral posting. Such ratings are periodically reviewed by the rating agencies.
Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness. Financial strength ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurer or reinsurer to meet its obligations under an insurance policy or reinsurance arrangement and generally involve quantitative and qualitative evaluations by rating agencies of a company’s financial condition and operating performance. Generally, rating agencies base their financial strength ratings upon information furnished to them by the respective company and upon their own investigations, studies and assumptions. Financial strength ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, agents, intermediaries and ceding companies and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Credit and financial strength ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and they may be revised or revoked at any time at the sole discretion of the rating organization.
As of December 31, 2018, Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P) and A.M. Best had issued credit or financial strength ratings and outlook statements regarding us as follows:

Company | A.M. Best | S&P | Fitch

Rating Agency | Financial StrengthRating Scale | Senior Unsecured NotesCredit Rating Scale
A.M. Best1 | “A++” to “S” | “aaa” to “rs” 
S&P2 | “AAA” to “R” | “AAA” to “D” 
Fitch3 | “AAA” to “C” | “AAA” to “D” 
1 A.M. Best’s financial strength rating is an independent opinion of an insurer’s or reinsurer’s financial strength and ability to meet its ongoing insurance policy and contract obligations. It is based on a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company’s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile or, where appropriate, the specific nature and details of a security. The analysis may include comparisons to peers, industry standards and proprietary benchmarks as well as assessments of operating plans, philosophy, management, risk appetite and the implicit or explicit support of a parent or affiliate. A.M. Best’s long-term credit ratings reflect its assessment of the ability of an obligor to pay interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. Ratings from “aa” to “ccc” may be enhanced with a “+” (plus) or “-“ (minus) to indicate whether credit quality is near the top or bottom of a category. A.M. Best’s short-term credit rating is an opinion as to the ability of the rated entity to meet its senior financial commitments on obligations maturing in generally less than one year.
2 S&P’s insurer financial strength rating is a forward-looking opinion about the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay under its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Generic rating categories range from “AAA” to “D”. A “+” or “-“ indicates relative strength within a generic category. An S&P credit rating is an assessment of default risk, but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default. Short-term issuer credit ratings reflect the obligor’s creditworthiness over a short-term time horizon. 
3 Fitch’s financial strength ratings provide an assessment of the financial strength of an insurance organization. The National Insurer Financial Strength Rating is assigned to the insurance company’s policyholder obligations, including assumed reinsurance obligations and policyholder obligations, such as guaranteed investment contracts. Within long-term and short-term ratings, a “+” or a “-” may be appended to a rating to denote relative status within major rating categories. 

In addition to the financial strength ratings, rating agencies use an outlook statement to indicate a medium or long-term trend which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A positive outlook indicates a rating may be raised and a negative outlook indicates a rating may be lowered. A stable outlook is assigned when ratings are not likely to be changed. Outlooks should not be confused with expected stability of the issuer’s financial or economic performance. A rating may have a stable outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change, but a stable outlook does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time without notice.
A.M. Best, S&P and Fitch review their ratings of insurance companies from time to time. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be changed or withdrawn entirely if, in the respective rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. While the degree to which ratings adjustments will affect sales and persistency is unknown, we believe if our ratings were to be negatively adjusted for any reason, we could experience a material decline in the sales of our products and the persistency of our existing business. See Item 1A. Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Our Business–A financial strength rating downgrade, potential downgrade or any other negative action by a rating agency could make our product offerings less attractive, inhibit our ability to acquire future business through acquisitions or reinsurance and increase our cost of capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business for further discussion about risks associated with financial strength ratings.
Competition
We operate in highly competitive markets. We face a variety of large and small industry participants, including diversified financial institutions and insurance and reinsurance companies. These companies compete in one form or another for the growing pool of retirement assets driven by a number of external factors such as the continued aging of the population and the reduction in safety nets provided by governments and private employers. As a result, scale and the ability to provide value-added services and build long-term relationships are important factors to compete effectively. See Item 1A. Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Our Business–We operate in a highly competitive industry that includes a number of competitors, many of which are larger and more well-known than we are, which could limit our ability to achieve our growth strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects for further discussion on competitive risks. We believe that our leading presence in the retirement market, diverse range of capabilities and broad distribution network uniquely position us to effectively serve consumers’ increasing demand for retirement solutions, particularly in the FIA market.
We face competition in the FIA market from traditional insurance carriers such as Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz) and American Equity Investment Life Insurance Company. Principal competitive factors for FIAs are initial crediting rates, reputation for renewal crediting action, product features, brand recognition, customer service, cost, distribution capabilities and financial strength ratings of the provider. Competition may affect, among other matters, both business growth and the pricing of our products and services. See Item 7.–Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Industry Trends and Competition–Competition for a discussion of our ranking and market share within the FIA market and the fixed annuity market more broadly.
Reinsurance markets are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. As a reinsurer, ALRe competes on the basis of many factors, including, among other things, financial strength, pricing and other terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements, reputation, service and experience in the types of business underwritten. The market impact of these and other factors related to reinsurance is generally not consistent across lines of business, domestic and international geographical areas and distribution channels. ALRe’s competition includes other insurance and reinsurance companies, such as Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated and Global Atlantic.
19

Item 1.    Business

We face strong competition within our institutional channel. With respect to funding agreements, namely those issued in connection with our FABN program, we compete with other insurers that have active FABN programs, such as MetLife, Inc. (MetLife) and American International Group, Inc. Within the funding agreement market, we compete primarily on the basis of perceived financial strength, interest rates and term. With respect to group annuities, we compete with other insurers that offer such annuities, such as MetLife and Prudential Financial, Inc. Within the PRT market, we compete primarily on the basis of price, underwriting and investment capabilities.
Finally, we face competition in the market for acquisition targets and profitable blocks of insurance. Such competition is likely to intensify as insurance businesses become more attractive acquisition targets for both other insurance companies and financial and other institutions and as the already substantial consolidation in the financial services industry continues. We believe that our demonstrated ability to source and consummate complex transactions is a competitive advantage over other similar acquirers. We also compete for potential acquisition and block reinsurance opportunities based on a number of factors including perceived financial strength, brand recognition, reputation and the pricing we are able to offer, which, to the extent we determine to finance a transaction, is in turn dependent on our ability to do so on suitable terms.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,275 employees located in Bermuda and the United States. We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees located in Bermuda or the United States are subject to collective bargaining agreements and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.
Regulation
Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact insurance business in, and are subject to regulation and supervision by, all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia. ALRe and AARe, our Bermuda domiciled insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to Bermuda’s Insurance Act 1978 (Bermuda Insurance Act). Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are licensed, regulated and supervised in all jurisdictions where they conduct insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, however. Most jurisdictions have regulations and laws that require insurers and agents to be licensed and set standards of solvency and business conduct to be maintained by the insurer. Additionally, state statutes and regulations often require state approval of policy forms, policy language, rates and in some instances, marketing materials. Most states’ statutes and regulations prescribe permitted types and concentrations of investments. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual financial statements with supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they transact an insurance business.
United States
General
Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, with the exception of Athene Re USA IV, Inc. (Athene Re IV) discussed further below, is organized and domiciled in one of the following states: Delaware, Iowa, or New York (each, an Athene Domiciliary State) and is also licensed in such state as an insurer. The insurance department of each Athene Domiciliary State regulates the applicable U.S. insurance subsidiary, and each U.S. insurance subsidiary is regulated by each of the insurance regulators in the other states where such company is authorized to transact insurance business. The primary purpose of such regulatory supervision is to protect policyholders rather than holders of any securities, such as the AHL common shares. Generally, insurance products underwritten by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold.
As part of our acquisition of Aviva USA, we acquired a special-purpose insurance company, Athene Re IV, which is a subsidiary of Athene Annuity and Life Company (AAIA). Athene Re IV is domiciled in Vermont and provides reinsurance to AAIA in order to facilitate the reserve financing associated with a closed block of policies resulting from the demutualization of a prior insurance company currently part of AAIA. As part of the acquisition of AAIA, the liabilities associated with such closed block of insurance policies, including any exposure to payments due from such special-purpose insurance company subsidiary, were reinsured to Accordia. We do not write business that requires the use of captive reinsurers.
State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers over our U.S. insurance subsidiaries with respect to all aspects of their insurance business including: (1) licensing to transact business; (2) licensing of producers; (3) prescribing which assets and liabilities are to be considered in determining statutory surplus; (4) regulating premium rates for certain insurance products; (5) approving policy forms and certain related materials; (6) determining whether a reasonable basis exists as to the suitability of the annuity purchase recommendations producers make; (7) regulating unfair trade and claims practices; (8) establishing reserve requirements, solvency standards and minimum capital requirements (MCR); (9) regulating the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year; (10) regulating the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, the terms thereof and the ability of an insurer to take credit on its financial statements for insurance ceded to reinsurers or other substitute financing solutions; (11) fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans, minimum crediting rates on accumulation products and minimum allowable surrender values; (12) regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted; (13) setting parameters for transactions with affiliates; and (14) regulating other matters.
20

Item 1.    Business

The rates, forms, terms and conditions of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated third parties generally are not directly subject to regulation by any state insurance department in the United States. This contrasts with primary insurance where, as discussed above, the policy forms and premium rates are generally regulated by state insurance departments.
From time to time, increased scrutiny has been placed upon the U.S. insurance regulatory framework, and a number of state legislatures have considered or enacted legislative measures that alter, and in many cases increase, state authority to regulate insurance and reinsurance companies. In addition to legislative initiatives of this type, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and state insurance regulators are regularly involved in a process of reexamining existing laws and regulations and their application to insurance and reinsurance companies.
Furthermore, while the federal government in most contexts currently does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in a number of areas, such as employee benefits regulation, age, sex and disability-based discrimination, financial services regulation and federal taxation, can significantly affect the insurance business. It is not possible to predict the future impact of changing regulation on our operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors–Risks Relating to Insurance and Other Regulatory Matters.
NAIC
The NAIC is an organization, the mandate of which is to benefit state insurance regulatory authorities and consumers by promulgating model insurance laws and regulations for adoption by the states. The NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through the NAIC Accounting Manual. However, model insurance laws and regulations are only effective when adopted by the states, and statutory accounting and reporting principles continue to be established by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices. Changes to the NAIC Accounting Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may affect the statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.
Some of the NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in the various states without affirmative action by the states. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. Also, regulatory actions with prospective impact can potentially have a significant impact on products that we currently sell. The NAIC continues to work to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to life insurance reserves.
In December 2012, the NAIC approved a new valuation manual containing a principle-based approach to life insurance company reserves. Principle-based reserving is designed to tailor the reserving process to specific products in an effort to create a principle-based modeling approach to reserving rather than the factor-based approach historically employed. Pursuant to the NAIC’s Standard Valuation Law (SVL) principle-based reserving became effective prospectively on January 1, 2017. Delaware and Iowa have each adopted a form of the SVL. New York has also passed legislation to adopt principle-based reserving, which will become effective on January 1, 2020. On December 7, 2018, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) issued an emergency regulation to begin the implementation of principle-based reserving for life insurers.
Restrictions on Dividends and Other Distributions
Current law of two of the Athene Domiciliary States, Delaware and Iowa, permits the payment of dividends or distributions which, together with dividends or distributions paid during the preceding twelve months do not exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the immediately preceding year end or (b) the net gain from operations of the insurer for the preceding twelve-month period ending as of the immediately preceding year end. Current law of New York permits the payment of dividends or distributions which, together with dividends or distributions paid during any calendar year, (1) is out of earned surplus and does not exceed the greater of (a) 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or (b) the net gain from operations of the insurer for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains, not to exceed 30% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or (2) do not exceed the lesser of (a) 10% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year or (b) the net gain from operations of the insurer for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains. Any proposed dividend in excess of these amounts is considered an extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution and may not be paid until it has been approved, or a 30-day waiting period has passed during which it has not been disapproved, by the Commissioner. Additionally, under current law of the Athene Domiciliary States, AAIA may only pay dividends from the insurer’s earned profits on its business, which shall not include contributed capital or contributed surplus, and AADE may only pay dividends from that part of its available and accumulated surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and realized capital gains, and ALICNY may only pay dividends pursuant to the “greater of” standard described above from that part of its positive unassigned funds, excluding 85% of the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses less capital gains tax, for the immediately preceding calendar year. The Athene Domiciliary States’ insurance laws and regulations also require that each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ surplus as regards policyholders following any dividend or distribution be reasonable in relation to such U.S. insurance subsidiary’s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs.

Credit for Reinsurance Ceded
The ability of a ceding insurer to take reserve and capital credit for the reinsurance purchased from reinsurance companies is a significant component of reinsurance regulation. Typically, a ceding insurer will only enter into a reinsurance agreement if it can obtain credit on its statutory basis financial statements against its reserves (report lower net reserves) and/or toward its MCR (the denominator in its risk-based capital (RBC) calculation) for the reinsurance ceded to the reinsurer. With respect to U.S.-domiciled ceding companies, credit is usually granted when the reinsurer is licensed or accredited in the state where the ceding company is domiciled. States also generally permit ceding insurers to take credit for reinsurance if the reinsurer: (1) is domiciled in a state with a credit for reinsurance law that is substantially similar to the credit for reinsurance law in the ceding insurer’s state of domicile, and (2) meets certain financial requirements. Credit for reinsurance purchased from a reinsurer that does not meet the foregoing conditions is generally allowed to the extent that such reinsurer secures its obligations with qualified collateral.
AARe has provided, and may in the future provide, reinsurance to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the normal course of business. AAIA has entered into a funds withheld coinsurance agreement with AARe under which it will cede to AARe a 100% quota share of its respective obligations to repay the principal upon maturity or earlier termination and to make periodic interest payments under funding agreements issued by it. AADE has entered into a similar arrangement on a modco basis with ALRe, subject in certain cases to amounts retained by AADE and/or periodic payments based on reserve levels. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries have similar arrangements with AARe with respect to substantially all of their other core business, under which between 80% and 100% of all such business is ceded to AARe on a modco basis, net of third party reinsurance. Our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries are not licensed, accredited or approved in any state in the U.S. and, consequently, must each collateralize its obligations to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or any third-party cedant in order for any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or any third-party cedant to obtain credit against its reserves on its statutory basis financial statements (unless the basis for such reinsurance transaction is modco). AARe and ALRe are both domiciled in Bermuda, which has a regulatory regime deemed to be equivalent to the European Union (EU) Solvency II.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) provides that only the state in which a ceding insurer is domiciled may regulate the financial statement credit for reinsurance taken by that ceding insurer; other states are no longer able to require additional collateral from unauthorized reinsurers or otherwise impose their own credit for reinsurance laws on ceding insurers that are licensed, but not domiciled, in such other states.
Under the amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation, collateral requirements may be reduced from 100% for unauthorized or non-accredited reinsurers meeting certain criteria as to financial strength and reliability that are domiciled in jurisdictions that are found to have strong systems of insurance regulation (each, a “Qualified Jurisdiction”). Pursuant to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation reinsurers are eligible to apply for “certified reinsurer” status and certified reinsurers are permitted to post collateral at reduced levels in the respective state. Delaware and Iowa have adopted the reduced collateral requirements under the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation, and New York has adopted the reduced collateral requirements under a predecessor statute.
Bermuda has been approved as a “Qualified Jurisdiction” with respect to certain classes of insurers, including Class E insurers such as our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries. The recognition of Bermuda as a Qualified Jurisdiction permits our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries to apply for “certified reinsurer” status with the ability (if so certified) to post reduced collateral for coverage provided by our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries to ceding insurers in the United States (including our U.S. insurance subsidiaries). The amount of collateral required to be posted by an insurer with this designation varies based upon the insurers’ credit rating. ALRe has been approved by the Delaware Department of Insurance as a certified reinsurer and is therefore eligible to post reduced collateral equal to 50% of statutory reserves ceded under coinsurance agreements with ceding companies domiciled in the state of Delaware, including AADE, with respect to new reinsurance agreements. ALRe has not been approved as a certified reinsurer in any other jurisdiction.
Statutory Investment Valuation Reserves
Life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S. are required to establish an asset valuation reserve (AVR) to stabilize statutory policyholder surplus from fluctuations in the market value of investments. The AVR consists of two components: (1) a “default component” for possible credit-related losses on fixed maturity investments and (2) an “equity component” for possible market-value losses on all types of equity investments, including real estate-related investments. Although future additions to the AVR will reduce the future statutory capital and surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, we do not believe that the impact under current regulations of such reserve requirements will materially affect our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Insurers domiciled in the U.S. also are required to establish an interest maintenance reserve (IMR) for net realized capital gains and losses, net of tax, on fixed maturity investments where such gains and losses are attributable to changes in interest rates, as opposed to credit-related causes. The IMR provides a buffer to our statutory capital and surplus in the event we have to sell securities in an unrealized loss position. The IMR is required to be amortized into statutory earnings on a basis reflecting the remaining period to maturity of the fixed maturity securities. These reserves are required by state insurance regulatory authorities to be established as liabilities on a life insurer’s statutory financial statements and may also be included in the liabilities assumed by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries pursuant to their reinsurance agreements with U.S.-based life insurer ceding companies.

Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis
The Athene Domiciliary States and other states have adopted laws and regulations with respect to policy and contract reserve sufficiency. Under applicable insurance laws, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are each required to annually conduct an analysis of the adequacy of all life insurance and annuity statutory reserves. A qualified actuary appointed by each such subsidiary’s board must submit an opinion annually for each such subsidiary which states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows resulting from the contractual obligations and related expenses of such subsidiary. The adequacy of the statutory reserves is considered in light of the assets held by such U.S. insurance subsidiary with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items, including, but not limited to, the investment earnings on such assets and the consideration anticipated to be received and retained under the related policies and contracts. At a minimum, such testing is done over a number of economic scenarios prescribed by the states, with the scenarios designed to stress anticipated cash flows for higher and/or lower future levels of interest rates. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries may find it necessary to increase reserves, which may decrease their statutory surplus, in order to pass additional cash flow testing requirements.
U.S. Statutory Reports and Regulatory Examinations
Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual reports, including financial statements, in accordance with prescribed statutory accounting rules, with regulatory officials in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. In addition, each U.S. insurance subsidiary is required to file quarterly reports prepared on the same basis, though with considerably less detail.
As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed examinations, generally once every three to five years, of the books, records, accounts and operations of insurance companies that are domiciled in their states. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other, non-domiciliary states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC. We are currently undergoing such an examination for the period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017. This exam is being led by the Delaware Department of Insurance in coordination with the Iowa Insurance Division and the NYSDFS. In connection with the exam, the Delaware Department of Insurance is conducting an exam of AADE and Athene Life Insurance Company (ALIC), the Iowa Insurance Division is conducting an exam of AAIA and Structured Annuity Reinsurance Company (STAR), and the NYSDFS is conducting an exam of Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York (AANY) and ALICNY.  The exam began on April 1, 2018 and is expected to be completed by July 1, 2019.
Vermont insurance laws and regulations applicable to Athene Re IV require it to file financial statements with the Commissioner of the Insurance Division of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. Additionally, Athene Re IV is subject to periodic financial examinations by the Insurance Division of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation.
Market Conduct Regulation
State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing claims settlement practices, the form and content of disclosure to consumers, illustrations, advertising, sales and complaint process practices. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations. In addition, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries must file, and in many jurisdictions and for some lines of business obtain regulatory approval for, rates and forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are currently undergoing the following market conduct examinations, each in the ordinary course of business: (1) the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions & Professional Registration is conducting a market conduct examination of AAIA, (2) the NYSDFS is conducting a market conduct examination of AANY, (3) the Iowa Insurance Division is conducting a market conduct examination of AAIA, (4) the Maryland Insurance Administration is conducting a market conduct examination of AAIA, and (5) the Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting a market conduct examination of AAIA and AADE. The California Department of Insurance is completing a review of the rating and underwriting practices of AAIA, AADE and AANY and the Massachusetts Division of Insurance is completing a limited scope market analysis of AAIA and AADE.
Capital Requirements
Regulators of each state have discretionary authority in connection with our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ continued licensing to limit or prohibit sales to policyholders within their respective states if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that such entities have not maintained the required level of minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction of business would be hazardous to policyholders.
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement RBC requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantively similar law. The NAIC Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act requires life insurance companies to submit an annual report (the Risk-Based Capital Report), which compares an insurer’s total adjusted capital (TAC) to its authorized control level RBC (ACL), each such term as defined pursuant to applicable state law. A company’s RBC is calculated by using a specified formula that applies factors to various risks inherent in the insurer’s operations, including risks attributable to its assets, underwriting experience, interest rates and other business expenses. The factors are higher for those items deemed to have greater underlying risk and lower for items deemed to have less underlying risk. Statutory RBC is measured on two bases, ACL and company action level RBC (CAL), with ACL calculated as one-half of CAL. Regulators typically use ACL in assessing companies and reviewing solvency requirements. Companies themselves typically report and are compared using the CAL standard.
23

Item 1.    Business

The Risk-Based Capital Report is used by regulators to set in motion appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show indications of weak or deteriorating conditions. RBC is an additional standard for MCR that insurers must meet to avoid being placed in rehabilitation or liquidation by regulators. The annual Risk-Based Capital Report, and the information contained therein, is not intended by the NAIC as a means to rank insurers.
RBC is a method of measuring the level of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, in light of its size and risk profile. It provides a means of assessing capital adequacy, where the degree of risk taken by the insurer is the primary determinant. The value of an insurer’s TAC in relation to its RBC, together with its trend in its TAC, is used as a basis for determining regulatory action that a state insurance regulator may be authorized or required to take with respect to an insurer. The four action levels include:

• | CAL: The insurer is required to submit a plan for corrective action when its TAC is equal to or less than 200% of ACL;


• | Regulatory Action Level: The insurer is required to submit a plan for corrective action and is subject to examination, analysis and specific corrective action when its TAC is equal to or less than 150% of ACL;


• | ACL: Regulators may place the insurer under regulatory control when its TAC is equal to or less than 100% of ACL; and


• | Mandatory Control Level: Regulators are required to place the insurer under regulatory control when its TAC is equal to or less than 70% of ACL.

TAC and RBC are calculated annually by insurers, as of December 31 of each year. As of December 31, 2018, each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ TAC was significantly in excess of the levels that would prompt regulatory action under the laws of the Athene Domiciliary States. As of December 31, 2018, the CAL RBC ratio of AADE (U.S. RBC ratio) was 421%. The calculation of RBC requires certain judgments to be made, and, accordingly, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ current RBC may be greater or less than the RBC calculated as of any date of determination.
Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
The NAIC has established the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) to assist state insurance departments in their oversight of the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS is a series of financial ratios calculated by the NAIC based on financial information submitted by insurers on an annual basis. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. The NAIC shares the IRIS ratios calculated for each insurer with the interested state insurance departments. Generally, an insurance company will be required to explain ratios that fall outside the usual range, and may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and action if one or more of its ratios fall outside the specified ranges. None of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are currently subject to non-ordinary course regulatory scrutiny based on their IRIS ratios.
Regulation of Investments
Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to laws and regulations in each Athene Domiciliary State that require diversification of its investment portfolio and limit the amounts of investments in certain asset categories, such as below-investment grade fixed income securities, real estate-related equity, partnerships, other equity investments, derivatives and alternative investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, could require the divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. Accordingly, the investment laws in the Athene Domiciliary States could prevent our U.S. insurance subsidiaries from pursuing investment opportunities which they believe are beneficial to their shareholders, which could in turn preclude Athene from realizing its investment objectives.
Guaranty Associations
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring insurance companies doing business within those jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations. Guaranty associations are organized to cover, subject to limits, contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by life insurance companies which later become impaired or insolvent. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on each member insurer doing business in a particular state on the basis of their proportionate share of the premiums written by all member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer previously engaged. Most states limit assessments in any year to 2% of the insurer’s average annual premium for the three years preceding the calendar year in which the impaired insurer became impaired or insolvent. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets, usually over a period of years. Assessments levied against our U.S. insurance subsidiaries by guaranty associations during the year ended December 31, 2018 were not material. While we cannot accurately predict the amount of future assessments or future insolvencies of competitors which would lead to such assessments, we believe that assessments with respect to pending insurance company impairments and insolvencies will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 1.    Business

Federal Oversight
Although the insurance business in the United States is primarily regulated by the states, federal initiatives can affect the businesses of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal measures are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance business. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, pension regulation, money laundering, privacy regulation, taxation and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance and reinsurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies.
Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and authorized the FSOC to designate non-bank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), thereby subjecting them to enhanced prudential standards and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). The prudential standards for non-bank SIFIs include enhanced RBC requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single counterparty exposure limits, governance requirements for risk management, stress test requirements, special debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, early remediation procedures, and recovery and resolution planning. On April 21, 2017, the President of the United States issued an executive memorandum (Executive Memorandum) to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department), directing the Secretary of the Treasury Department to conduct a review of, and report to the President regarding, FSOC processes and imposing a temporary moratorium on non-emergency SIFI determinations and designations pending completion of such review and receipt of such report. The requested report, which the Treasury Department published on November 17, 2017, recommends significant changes to the FSOC processes for making SIFI determinations and designations. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which became effective May 24, 2018, made limited changes to Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act but did not make many of the changes recommended in the Treasury Department’s report. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to the future of federal regulation of non-bank SIFIs. If the FSOC were to determine that Athene USA Corporation (Athene USA) or any of our U.S. subsidiaries is a non-bank SIFI, such entity would become subject to certain of these enhanced prudential standards.
The Dodd-Frank Act, which effected the most far-reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades, established the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department. While currently not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the Director of the Federal Insurance Office performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding non-bank financial companies to be designated as SIFIs. 
The Dodd-Frank Act also authorizes the Federal Insurance Office to assist the Secretary of the Treasury Department in negotiating covered agreements. A covered agreement is an agreement between the United States and one or more foreign governments, authorities or regulatory entities, regarding prudential measures with respect to insurance or reinsurance. The Federal Insurance Office is further charged with determining, in accordance with the procedures and standards established under the Dodd-Frank Act, whether state laws are preempted by a covered agreement. Pursuant to this authority, in September 2017, the U.S. and the EU signed a covered agreement to address, among other things, reinsurance collateral requirements (EU Covered Agreement). In addition, on December 11, 2018, the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced their intent to sign a Bilateral Agreement between the U.S. and the UK on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance in anticipation of the UK’s exit from the EU in March 2019 (UK Covered Agreement). The UK Covered Agreement is subject to a 90-day notification period to the U.S. Congress before it can be signed and come into effect. U.S. state regulators have 60 months, or five years, to adopt reinsurance reforms removing reinsurance collateral requirements for EU and UK reinsurers that meet the prescribed minimum conditions set forth in the applicable EU Covered Agreement or UK Covered Agreement or else state laws imposing such reinsurance collateral requirements may be subject to federal preemption. The NAIC is currently working to adopt amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation to conform to the requirements of the EU Covered Agreement and UK Covered Agreement. The reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and the UK Covered Agreement may increase competition, in particular with respect to pricing for reinsurance transactions, by lowering the cost at which competitors of ALRe are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers. We cannot predict with any certainty what impact the EU Covered Agreement or UK Covered Agreement will have on our business, whether either agreement will be implemented or what the impact of such implementation will be on our business.
FIAs
In recent years, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state securities regulators have questioned whether FIAs, such as those sold by our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, should be treated as securities under the federal and state securities laws rather than as insurance products exempted from such laws. On December 17, 2008, the SEC voted to approve Rule 151A, and apply federal securities oversight to FIAs issued on or after January 12, 2011. On July 12, 2010, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals vacated Rule 151A. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, annuities that meet specific requirements are specifically exempted from being treated as securities by the SEC. We expect that the types of FIAs our U.S. insurance subsidiaries currently sell will meet applicable requirements for exemption from treatment as securities and therefore will remain exempt from being treated as securities by the SEC and state securities regulators. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state securities laws or state insurance laws and regulations will not be amended or interpreted to impose further requirements on FIAs. Treatment of these products as securities would require additional registration and licensing of these products and the agents selling them, as well as cause our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to seek new or additional marketing relationships for these products, any of which may impose significant restrictions on their ability to conduct business as currently operated.

Item 1.    Business

Unclaimed Property Laws
Each of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of abandoned or unclaimed money or property. State treasurers, controllers and revenue departments have been scrutinizing escheatment practices of life insurance companies with regard to unclaimed life insurance and annuity death benefits. As with state insurance regulators, state revenue authorities have been looking at how life insurance companies handle unreported deaths, maturity of life insurance and annuity contracts, and contracts that have exceeded limiting age to determine if the companies are appropriately determining when death benefits or other payments under the contracts should be treated as unclaimed property. State treasurers, controllers and revenue departments have audited life insurance companies, required escheatments and imposed interest penalties on amounts escheated for failure to escheat death benefits or other contract benefits when beneficiaries could not be found at the expiration of statutory dormancy periods.
Several states have enacted new laws or adopted new regulations mandating the use by insurance companies of the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Social Security Death Index (Death Master File) or other similar databases to identify deceased persons and to implement more rigorous processes to find beneficiaries. In 2013, prior to our acquisition of Aviva USA, it entered into multi-state settlement agreements with the insurance regulators and treasurers for 48 states in connection with certain of its subsidiaries’ use of the Death Master File. As part of the settlement, AAIA and its subsidiary ALICNY agreed to pay a $4 million assessment for examination, compliance and monitoring costs without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, and further agreed to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure timely payment of valid claims to beneficiaries in accordance with insurance laws and to timely report and remit unclaimed proceeds to the appropriate states in connection with unpaid property laws. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries could continue to be subject to risks related to unpaid benefits, the Death Master File, and the procedures required by the prior multi-state settlement as they relate to our annuity business. Furthermore, administrative challenges associated with implementing the procedures described above may make compliance with the multi-state settlement and applicable law difficult and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.
AADE is currently undergoing a multi-state unclaimed property examination led by Verus Financial, on behalf of California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. AADE is also a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the West Virginia Treasurer, State of West Virginia ex rel. John D. Perdue v. Liberty Life Ins. Co., Case No. 12-C-419, pursuant to which the Treasurer alleges that Liberty Life, now known as AADE, failed to adopt reasonable procedures, such as using the Death Master File, to identify deceased insureds with unpaid death benefits and timely escheat those unclaimed benefits to the state. The Treasurer accordingly seeks to recover unpaid death benefits, statutory interest and penalties. We do not expect that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Regulation of OTC Derivatives
We use derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with our businesses, including options purchased to hedge the derivatives embedded in the FIAs that we have issued, and swaps, futures and/or options may be used to manage the impact of increased benefit exposures from our annuity products that offer guaranteed benefits. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act creates a comprehensive framework for the federal oversight and regulation of the OTC derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in the market and requires U.S. regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing its provisions. Regulations have been finalized and implemented in many areas and are being finalized for implementation in others.
The Dodd-Frank Act divides the regulatory responsibility for swaps in the United States between the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC regulates swaps and swap entities, and the SEC regulates security-based swaps and security-based swap entities. The CFTC and the SEC have jointly finalized certain regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, including critical rulemakings on the definitions of “swap,” “security-based swap,” “swap dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap participant” and “major security-based swap participant.” In addition, the CFTC has substantially finalized its required rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, including regulations relating to the registration and regulation of swap dealers, major swap participants and swap execution facilities, reporting, recordkeeping, mandatory clearing, mandatory on-facility trade execution and mandatory minimum margin requirements. The SEC has yet to implement its regulatory regime for security-based swaps and market participants transacting in security-based swaps, including security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants subject to the SEC’s oversight. As a result of this bifurcation and the different pace at which the agencies have promulgated and implemented regulations, different transactions are subject to different levels of regulation.
26

Item 1.    Business

The Dodd-Frank Act and the CFTC rules thereunder require us, in connection with certain swap transactions, to comply with mandatory clearing and on-facility trade execution requirements, and it is anticipated that the types of swaps subject to these requirements will be expanded over time. In addition, regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act require us to comply with mandatory minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps and, in some instances, uncleared security-based swaps. Derivative clearing requirements and mandatory margin requirements could increase the cost of our risk mitigation and could have other implications. For example, increased margin requirements, combined with netting restrictions and restrictions on securities that qualify as eligible collateral, could reduce our liquidity and require increased holdings of cash and highly liquid securities with lower yields causing a reduction in income. In addition, the requirement that certain trades be centrally cleared through clearinghouses subjects us to documentation that is significantly more counterparty-favorable and may entitle counterparties to unilaterally change terms such as trading limits and the amount of margin required. The ability of any such counterparty to take such actions could create trading disruptions and liquidity concerns. Finally, the requirement that certain trades be centrally cleared through clearinghouses concentrates counterparty risk in both clearinghouses and clearing members. The failure of a clearinghouse could have a significant impact on the financial system. Even if a clearinghouse does not fail, large losses could force significant capital calls on clearinghouse members during a financial crisis, which could lead clearinghouse members to default. Because clearinghouses are still developing and the related bankruptcy process is untested, it is difficult to anticipate or identify all risks related to the default of a clearinghouse.
The Dodd-Frank Act and new regulations thereunder and similar regulations issued by non-U.S. jurisdictions that may indirectly apply to us could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our credit risk exposure. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder and other similar regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable which could adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, we have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures might prove ineffective in reducing the risks to which insurance policies expose us or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Any such losses could be increased by the increased cost of entering into derivatives and the reduced availability of customized derivatives that might result from the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the long-term future of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act and the related regulations implemented by the CFTC and the SEC and their impact on us remain uncertain and unpredictable, particularly in light of actions taken by the federal government. Two executive orders were issued in 2017 that established core principles for regulating the U.S. financial system and provided a framework for comprehensive change to current financial regulation. Additionally, the executive orders required federal agencies to designate a “Regulatory Reform Officer” and a “Regulatory Reform Task Force” to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to repeal, replace or modify regulations that, among others, inhibit job creation, are ineffective or impose costs that exceed benefits. In response to these executive orders, the CFTC announced its project to simplify and modernize the CFTC’s rules and regulations regarding derivatives within its jurisdiction. The CFTC has published various white papers that identify areas for regulatory streamlining and clarity and has indicated that staff is working on regulatory revisions to existing rules. While the CFTC has published some final rules reflecting regulatory revisions, it is anticipated that further regulatory revisions will continue to be forthcoming from the CFTC as a result of the on-going project. We cannot predict the impact of the executive orders on Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, derivatives regulatory schemes in other jurisdictions and our derivatives activities.
Consumer Protection Laws and Privacy and Data Security Regulation
Numerous other federal and state laws also affect our operations, including federal and state consumer protection laws. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services which are offered by issuers of securities in our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ investment portfolio.
Federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions, including insurers, to protect the security and confidentiality of nonpublic personal information, including certain health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of Social Security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain nonpublic personal information, including Social Security numbers. In addition, state laws and regulations restrict the disclosure of the medical record and health status information obtained by insurers.
Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of nonpublic personal information. Furthermore, the issues surrounding data security and the safeguarding of consumers’ protected information are under increasing regulatory scrutiny by state and federal regulators, particularly in light of the number and severity of recent U.S. companies’ data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Communications Commission, the NYSDFS and the NAIC have undertaken various studies, reports and actions regarding data security for entities under their respective supervision. Some states have recently enacted new insurance laws that require certain regulated entities to implement and maintain comprehensive information security programs to safeguard the personal information of insureds and enrollees.

On March 1, 2017, the NYSDFS enacted 23 NYCRR 500, a cybersecurity regulation governing financial companies. This rule requires banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NYSDFS, including us, to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program “designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State’s financial services industry.” Since the rule’s effective date, we have committed significant time and resources to comply with the rule’s requirements. We anticipate that the NYSDFS will examine the cybersecurity programs of financial institutions in the future and such examinations may result in additional regulatory scrutiny, expenditure of resources and possible regulatory actions and reputational harm.
In October 2017, the NAIC adopted a new Insurance Data Security Model Law, which is intended to establish the standards for data security and standards for the investigation and notification of data breaches applicable to insurance licensees in states adopting such law, with provisions that are generally consistent with the NYSDFS cybersecurity regulation discussed above. As with all NAIC model laws, this model law must be adopted by a state before becoming law in such state. We anticipate that more states will begin adopting the model law in the near term. Neither Delaware nor Iowa has adopted a version of the Insurance Data Security Model Law. The NAIC has also adopted a guidance document that sets forth twelve principles for effective insurance regulation of cybersecurity risks based on similar regulatory guidance adopted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the “Roadmap for Cybersecurity Consumer Protections,” which describes the protections to which the NAIC believes consumers should be entitled from their insurance companies, agents and other businesses concerning the collection and maintenance of consumers’ personal information, as well as what consumers should expect when such information has been involved in a data breach. We expect cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant regulatory focus by such regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations.
On June 28, 2018 the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) was signed into law. The CCPA is the first law passed in the U.S. that protects its residents’ rights to have control over the data companies collect about them. The CCPA will go into effect on January 1, 2020 and the California Attorney General will begin enforcement on July 1, 2020. The bill was drafted and passed in short order and while the express purpose of the bill is clear, its application in practice is difficult to ascertain. We expect that additional revisions and/or guidance will be forthcoming. We are closely monitoring legislative changes in the rule and working to implement the requirements in their current form. We may be required to incur significant expense in order to meet the requirements of the CCPA.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which implemented fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the United States, includes privacy requirements for financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers’ nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the re-disclosure and re-use of such information.
Our investment in a limited partnership which is in the business of originating residential mortgage loans (RML), as well as our direct investment in any residential or other mortgage loans, may expose us to various environmental and other regulation. For example, to the extent that we hold whole mortgage loans as part of our investment portfolio, we may be responsible for certain tax payments or subject to liabilities under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. Additionally, we may be subject to regulation by the CFPB as a mortgage holder or property owner. We are currently unable to predict the impact of such regulation on our business.
Broker-dealers
Our securities operations, principally conducted by our limited purpose SEC-registered broker-dealer, Athene Securities, LLC, are subject to federal and state securities and related laws, and are regulated principally by the SEC, state securities authorities and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Athene Securities, LLC does not hold customer funds or safekeep customer securities or otherwise engage in any securities transactions. Athene Securities, LLC was the principal underwriter of a block of variable annuity contracts which has been closed to new investors since 2002. The closed block of variable annuity contracts was issued by a predecessor of AAIA. Athene Securities, LLC continues to receive concessions on those variable annuity contracts. Athene Securities, LLC also provides supervisory oversight to Athene employees who are registered representatives.
Athene Securities, LLC and employees or personnel registered with Athene Securities, LLC are subject to the Exchange Act and to regulation and examination by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, penalties and fines, disgorgement of profits, restitution to customers, cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.
As a registered broker-dealer and member of various self-regulatory organizations, Athene Securities, LLC is subject to the SEC’s net capital rule, which specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer is required to maintain and requires a minimum part of its assets to be kept in relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. The net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of preventing a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and may require that prior notice to the regulators be provided prior to making capital withdrawals. Compliance with net capital requirements could limit operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as trading activities and underwriting, and may limit the ability of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA)
We also may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) when providing a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans governed by ERISA. ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. Among other things, ERISA imposes reporting and disclosure obligations, prescribes standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibits transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions, self-dealing and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a “party in interest.” ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA. We are also subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with ERISA plans, which may affect our ability to, or the terms upon which we may, enter into transactions with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to “party in interest” status. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code) are subject to enforcement by the DOL, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Severe penalties are imposed for breach of duties under ERISA.
The SEC has indicated that it will work with the DOL to propose rules creating a uniform standard of conduct applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers, which, if adopted, may affect the distribution of our products. The NAIC is working to propose changes to the SAT and some states separately are updating their suitability regulations to include the best interest concept. Should the SEC, NAIC or state-specific rules, once adopted, not align, the distribution of our products could be further complicated.
Bermuda
General
The Bermuda Insurance Act regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries, and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under such act by the BMA. The BMA is required by the Bermuda Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. See –Fit and Proper Controllers below.
The continued registration of an insurer is subject to the insurer complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Bermuda Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.
The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies solvency standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below.
Classification of Insurers
The Bermuda Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on special purpose business and insurers carrying on general business. Long-term business is generally defined as life, annuity and accident and health insurance, while general business broadly includes all types of insurance that are not long-term business (property and casualty business). Special purpose business is fully funded insurance business approved by the BMA to be written by a company registered as a Special Purpose Insurer. There are five classifications of insurers carrying on long-term business, ranging from Class A insurers (pure captives) to Class E insurers (larger commercial carriers). Class A insurers are subject to the lightest regulation and Class E insurers are subject to the strictest regulation.
Our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries, which are incorporated to carry on long-term business, are each registered as a Class E insurer which is the license class for long-term insurers and reinsurers with total assets of more than $500 million that are not registrable as a single-parent or multi-owner long-term captive insurer or reinsurer. Our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries are not licensed to conduct general business and have not sought authorization as reinsurers in any state or jurisdiction of the U.S. Consequently, in order for ceding companies of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries to receive statutory reserve or RBC credit for the reinsurance provided, reinsurance transactions are typically structured in one of three ways: (1) coinsurance, where the respective Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary’s obligation to the applicable ceding company in connection with reinsurance transactions is secured by assets held in trust for the benefit of the applicable ceding company, (2) funds withheld, where, although the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary recognizes the insurance reserve liabilities, the assets to secure such liabilities are held and maintained by the applicable ceding company, or (3) modco, where both the insurance reserves and assets supporting the reserves are retained by the applicable ceding company.
29

Item 1.    Business

Cancellation of Insurer’s Registration
The BMA could revoke or suspend the license of one or more of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries in circumstances in which (1) it is shown that false, misleading or inaccurate information has been supplied to the BMA by the subsidiary or on its behalf for the purposes of any provision of the Bermuda Insurance Act, (2) the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary has ceased to carry on business, (3) the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary has persistently failed to pay fees due under the Bermuda Insurance Act, (4) the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary has been shown to have not complied with a condition attached to its registration or with a requirement made of it under the Bermuda Insurance Act, (5) the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary is convicted of an offense against a provision of the Bermuda Insurance Act or (6) the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary is, in the opinion of the BMA, found not to have been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles.
Public Disclosure
The Bermuda Insurance Act provides the BMA with powers to set standards on public disclosure. Using this power, the BMA requires all commercial insurers and insurance groups, subject to certain exceptions, to prepare and publish a Financial Condition Report on their website.
Non-insurance Business
Pursuant to the Bermuda Insurance Act, as Class E insurers, our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries are not permitted to engage in non-insurance business unless such non-insurance business is ancillary to its core business. Non-insurance business means any business other than insurance business and includes carrying on investment business, managing an investment fund as operator, carrying on business as a fund administrator, carrying on banking business, underwriting debt or securities or otherwise engaging in investment banking, engaging in commercial or industrial activities and carrying on the business of management, sales or leasing of real property.
Annual Financial Statements, Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return
Class E insurers must file annual statutory financial statements and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards, accounting principles generally accepted in the UK or accounting principles generally accepted in Canada within four months of the end of each fiscal year, unless such deadline is specifically extended. The Bermuda Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial returns, which include, in statutory form, an insurer information sheet, an auditor’s report, a balance sheet, income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto. The Statutory Financial Statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer.
In addition, each year a Class E insurer is required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with its annual statutory financial return. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return is comprised of: the BMA’s Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR) model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof; a statutory economic balance sheet; the approved actuary’s opinion; and several prescribed schedules, including a schedule of fixed income and equity investments by BSCR rating, a schedule of funds held by ceding reinsurers in segregated accounts/trusts by BSCR rating, a schedule of risk management and a schedule of eligible capital, among others. The BSCR is not available for public inspection.
Minimum Margin of Solvency (MMS), Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
Class E insurers must at all times maintain an MMS and an ECR in accordance with the provisions of the Bermuda Insurance Act. The Bermuda Insurance Act mandates certain actions and filings with the BMA if an insurer fails to meet and/or maintain its ECR or MMS including the filing of a written report detailing the circumstances giving rise to the failure and the manner and time within which the insurer intends to rectify the failure.
The MMS a Class E insurer is required to maintain with respect to its long-term business is the greater of (1) $8 million, (2) 2% of the first $500 million of assets plus 1.5% of applicable assets above $500 million or (3) 25% of the ECR as reported at the end of the relevant year.
The BMA has embedded an economic balance sheet (EBS) framework as part of the BSCR that forms the basis for an insurer’s ECR. The premise underlying the EBS framework is the idea that assets and liabilities should be valued on a consistent economic basis. Under the Bermuda Regulatory Framework there are two solvency calculations: (1) a Class E Insurer must have total statutory capital and surplus as reported on the insurer’s statutory balance sheet greater than the MMS calculated pursuant to the Insurance Account Rules 2016; and (2) under the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class C, Class D and Class E Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 an insurer is required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of its ECR.
A Class E insurer’s ECR is established by reference to the Class E BSCR model. The BSCR model provides a method for determining an insurer’s capital requirements (statutory economic capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurer’s business. The BSCR formula establishes capital requirements for fourteen categories of risk: fixed income investment risk, equity investment risk, long-term interest rate/liquidity risk, currency risk, concentration risk, credit risk, operational risk and seven categories of long-term insurance risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to asset, premium, reserve, creditor, probable maximum loss and operation items, with higher factors applied to items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.

Item 1.    Business

The BMA released the final amended Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class C, Class D, and Class E Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2018 (Prudential Rules) on July 17, 2018 that provides updates to certain aspects of the EBS framework. The Prudential Rules will take effect on January 1, 2019 and increase the ECR over a 10-year grade-in period.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, ALRe’s EBS capital and surplus resulted in BSCR ratios of 340% and 354%, respectively. While not specifically referred to in the Bermuda Insurance Act, target capital level (TCL) is also an important threshold for statutory capital and surplus. TCL is equal to 120% of ECR as calculated pursuant to the BSCR formula. TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA. If an insurer fails to maintain statutory capital at least equal to its TCL, such failure will likely result in increased regulatory oversight by the BMA. A Class E insurer which at any time fails to meet its applicable ECR shall, upon becoming aware of such failure or upon having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, immediately notify the BMA in writing. Within 14 days of such notification, such Class E insurer shall file with the BMA a written report containing details of the circumstances leading to the failure and a plan detailing the specific actions to be taken to rectify the failure, and the time within which the Class E insurer intends to rectify the failure. Within 45 days of becoming aware of such failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, such Class E insurer shall furnish the BMA with (1) unaudited statutory economic balance sheets and unaudited interim statutory financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP covering such period as the BMA may require; (2) an opinion of the approved actuary in relation to total long-term business insurance technical provisions as set out in the statutory economic balance sheet, where applicable; (3) a long-term business solvency certificate in respect of the financial statements; and (4) a capital and solvency return reflecting an ECR prepared using post-failure data where applicable.
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, an insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if in breach of its ECR or MMS or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where an insurer fails to meet its MMS on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA. The Bermuda Insurance Act also prohibits our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s total statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the respective Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary’s board of directors and its principal representative sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause such Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary meeting its MMS and ECR, such Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA. Further, each of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet by 15% or more. Each of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries is also prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends unless the value of its long-term business assets exceeds its long-term business liabilities, as certified by its approved actuary, by the amount of the dividend and at least the MMS. These restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the Bermuda Insurance Act are in addition to those under Bermuda’s Companies Act 1981 (the Companies Act) which apply to all Bermuda companies. Under the Companies Act, a company may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (1) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or (2) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities.
Eligible Capital
To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the insurer’s capital resources, a Class E insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the ‘3-tiered capital system.’ Under this system, all of the insurer’s capital instruments must be classified as either basic or ancillary capital. All capital instruments are further classified into one of three tiers based on their “loss absorbency” characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified as Tier 1 Capital, lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support the insurer’s MMS, ECR and TCL. The Bermuda Insurance Act requires that Class E insurers have Tier 1 Capital equal to or greater than 50% of the value of its ECR, Tier 2 Capital not greater than Tier 1 Capital and Tier 3 Capital of not more than 17.65% of the aggregate of its Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital.
The characteristics of the capital instruments that must be satisfied to qualify as Tier 1, 2 and 3 Capital are set forth in the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules 2012, and any amendments thereto. Under those rules, Tier 1, 2 and 3 Capital may, until January 1, 2026, include capital instruments with the following characteristics: (1) non-redeemable or settled only with the issuance of an instrument of equal or higher quality upon a breach in the ECR (Tier 1, 2 and 3 Capital); (2) coupon payment on the instrument be cancellable or deferrable indefinitely, upon breach in the ECR (Tier 1 and 2 Capital); or (3) coupon payment on the instrument be cancellable or deferrable indefinitely upon breach in the MMS (Tier 3 Capital).
Where the BMA has previously approved the use of certain instruments for capital purposes, the BMA’s consent will need to be obtained if such instruments are to remain eligible for use in satisfying the MMS and the ECR. We do not currently use any such instruments.

Item 1.    Business

Code of Conduct
Every Bermuda registered insurer must comply with the Insurance Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct) which prescribes the duties and standards that must be complied with to ensure sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls are implemented. The BMA will assess an insurer’s compliance with the Code of Conduct in a proportionate manner relative to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Code of Conduct will be taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Bermuda Insurance Act and may result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention and investigation (see below) and, in the case of our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries, as Class E insurers, will be a factor in calculating the operational risk charge under each insurer’s BSCR or approved internal model.
Fit and Proper Controllers
The BMA maintains supervision over the “controllers” of all registered insurers in Bermuda. For these purposes, a “controller” includes (1) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company, (3) a shareholder controller, and (4) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or its parent company are accustomed to act.
The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Bermuda Insurance Act but generally refers to (1) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, (2) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company or (3) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting.
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, shareholder controller ownership is defined as follows:

Actual Shareholder Controller Voting Power | Defined Shareholder Controller Voting Power
10% or more but less than 20% | 10% 
20% or more but less than 33% | 20% 
33% or more but less than 50% | 33% 
50% or more | 50% 

Where the shares of a registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognized stock exchange, and such shareholder becomes a 10%, 20%, 33%, or 50% shareholder controller of the insurer, that shareholder shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that such shareholder has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a controller of any such category.
Under our bye-laws, we have imposed restrictions on the ownership by holders of our Class A common shares (other than the Apollo Group) controlling more than 9.9% of the voting power associated with our common shares. The voting rights exercisable by shareholders of the Company other than the Apollo Group will be limited so that Control Groups are not deemed to hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power conferred by our shares. In addition, our board of directors retains certain discretion to make adjustments to the aggregate number of votes attaching to the shares of any person or group that they consider fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that such person or group will not hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power represented by our then outstanding shares. As such, other than the Apollo Group (at the 33% shareholder controller level), no shareholder will be considered, according to the Bermuda Insurance Act, a shareholder controller of AARe or ALRe.
Any person or entity who contravenes the Bermuda Insurance Act by failing to give notice or knowingly becoming a controller of any description before the required 45 days has elapsed is guilty of an offense under Bermuda law and liable to a fine of $25,000 on summary conviction.
The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person or entity who has become a controller of any category when it appears that such person or entity is not, or is no longer, fit and proper to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person or entity concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person or entity served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. Any person or entity who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection is guilty of an offense and liable on summary conviction to a fine of $25,000 (and a continuing fine of $500 per day for each day that the offense is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of $100,000 and/or 2 years in prison.

Notification of Material Changes
All registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Bermuda Insurance Act. For the purposes of the Bermuda Insurance Act, the following changes are material: (1) the transfer or acquisition of insurance business, including portfolio transfers or corporate restructurings, pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Section 25 of the Bermuda Insurance Act or Section 99 of the Companies Act, (2) the amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm, (3) engaging in unaffiliated, third-party business that is retail business, (4) the acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business which offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer, (5) outsourcing all or substantially all of the company’s actuarial, risk management, compliance or internal audit functions, (6) outsourcing all or a material part of an insurer’s underwriting activity, (7) the transfer other than by way of reinsurance of all or substantially all of a line of business, (8) the expansion into a material new line of business, (9) the sale of an insurer and (10) outsourcing of an “officer” role, as such term is defined by the Bermuda Insurance Act.
As registered insurers, our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries may not take any steps to give effect to such a material change unless they have first served notice on the BMA that they intend to effect such material change and before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary in writing that the BMA has no objection to such change or that period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection.
Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary a preliminary written notice stating the BMA’s intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the applicable Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiary may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA, which the BMA would take into account in making its final determination.
Supervision, Investigation and Intervention
The BMA may appoint an inspector with powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if the BMA believes that an investigation is required in the interests of the insurer’s policyholders or potential policyholders. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to the inspector, the BMA may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with its business.
If it appears to the BMA that there is a risk of an insurer becoming insolvent, or that it is in breach of the Bermuda Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, the BMA may, among other things, direct the insurer (1) not to take on any new insurance business, (2) not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase its liabilities, (3) not to make certain investments, (4) to liquidate certain investments, (5) to maintain or transfer to the custody of a specified bank, certain assets, (6) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to impose restrictions on such payments, (7) to limit its premium income, (8) not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified persons or persons of a specified class, (9) to provide the BMA with such financial information regarding the insurer as the BMA may request, (10) to obtain the opinion of an actuary loss reserve specialist for submission to the BMA, and (11) to remove a controller or officer.
Exchange Control
The permission of the BMA is required, pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of shares (which includes the Class A common shares) of Bermuda companies to or from a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA, in its notice to the public dated June 1, 2005, has granted a general permission for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of a Bermuda company from and/or to a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes for so long as any “Equity Securities” of the company (which includes the Class A common shares) are listed on an “Appointed Stock Exchange” (which includes the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)).
Economic Substance Act 2018 (ESA)
During 2017, the EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council released a list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The stated purpose of this list, and accompanying report, was to promote good governance worldwide in order to maximize efforts to prevent tax fraud and tax evasion. Bermuda was not on the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, but was referenced in the report (along with approximately 40 other jurisdictions) as having committed to address concerns relating to economic substance by December 31, 2018. In accordance with that commitment, Bermuda enacted the ESA. Under the ESA, if a company is engaged in one or more “relevant activities” (which is defined to include insurance) it is required to maintain a substantial economic presence in Bermuda and to comply with the economic substance requirements set forth in the ESA. A company will comply with those economic substance requirements if it: (a) is managed and directed in Bermuda; (b) undertakes “core income generating activities” (as may be prescribed under the ESA) in Bermuda in respect of the relevant activity; (c) maintains adequate physical presence in Bermuda; (d) has adequate full time employees in Bermuda with suitable qualifications; and (e) incurs adequate operating expenditure in Bermuda in relation to the relevant activity undertaken by it. 
Companies that carry on insurance as a relevant activity are deemed to comply with the economic substance requirements, with respect to their insurance business, if they comply with the existing provisions of (a) the Companies Act 1981 relating to corporate governance; and (b) the Insurance Act 1978, that are applicable to the economic substance requirements.

The GDPR went into effect on May 25, 2018. It was enacted by the European Commission to regulate and protect data of individuals located within the EU. As tax residents of the UK, AHL and ALRe are likely subject to the territorial scope of the GDPR under Article 3(1). To the extent that AHL and/or ALRe is under the territorial scope of the GDPR, the regulation would only apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the context of such entity’s UK activities. Currently, the volume of personal data processed in connection with each entity’s UK activities is insignificant. We regularly monitor our business activities to ensure we are prepared for compliance, should the GDPR ever apply to our business more broadly.
Entity-Wide
NAIC
Group Capital – The NAIC is in the process of developing a methodology for the calculation of capital for all the entities in an insurance holding company system group, including non-U.S. entities. The goal is to provide U.S. regulators with a method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in an insurance group in a way that applies to all insurance groups regardless of their structure. The NAIC has stated that the calculation will be a regulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. Nonetheless, any new group capital calculation methodology may incorporate existing risk-based capital concepts. It is not possible to predict what impact any such regulatory tool may have on our business.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act – We are subject to the ORSA Model Act, which has been enacted by each Athene Domiciliary State, and requires insurance companies to assess the adequacy of their and their group’s risk management and current and future solvency position. Under the ORSA Model Act, certain insurers must undertake an internal risk management review no less often than annually (but also at any time when there are significant changes to the risk profile of the insurer or its insurance group), in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual, and prepare an ORSA Report assessing the adequacy of the insurer’s risk management and capital in light of its current and future business plans. The ORSA Report is required to be filed annually with a company’s lead state regulator and made available to other domiciliary regulators within the holding company system.
Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act and Model Regulation (together, the Corporate Governance Model Act) – In November 2014, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Model Act, which requires an insurer to provide an annual disclosure regarding its corporate governance practices to its lead state and/or domestic regulator. As adopted by the NAIC, the requirements of the Corporate Governance Model Act became effective January 1, 2016, with the first annual disclosure due by June 1, 2016. The Corporate Governance Model Act must be adopted by the individual states for the new requirements to apply, and specifically in Delaware, Iowa and New York for the changes to apply to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Both Delaware and Iowa have adopted forms of the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act. To date, New York has not adopted the Corporate Governance Model Act, and it is not possible to predict whether New York will adopt the Corporate Governance Model Act in the future; however, the NAIC has made the Corporate Governance Model Act part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation, which may motivate New York to adopt the Corporate Governance Model Act.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation – Each direct and indirect parent of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (including AHL) is subject to the insurance holding company laws of each of the Athene Domiciliary States. These laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such holding company system to register with their U.S. insurance regulators and to file certain reports with those authorities, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and general business operations. Generally, under these laws, transactions between our U.S. insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates, including any reinsurance transactions, must be fair and reasonable and, if material or included within a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the insurance department of each applicable Athene Domiciliary State.

Item 1.    Business

Most states, including each of the Athene Domiciliary States, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer, which would include a change of control of its holding company. Laws such as these prevent any person from acquiring direct or indirect control of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries or their holding companies unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the commissioner or director of the insurance department of the applicable Athene Domiciliary State (each, a Commissioner) and has obtained the Commissioner’s prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, including those of each of the Athene Domiciliary States, acquiring 10% or more of a voting interest in an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of a voting interest in a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (or AHL) without the prior approval of the Commissioner of the applicable Athene Domiciliary State will be in violation of the applicable Athene Domiciliary State’s law and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the Commissioner or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the Commissioner. Further, a willful violation of these laws is punishable in each Athene Domiciliary State as a criminal offense. In addition, the Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (Amended Holding Company Model Act) requires any controlling person of a U.S. insurer seeking to divest its controlling interest in the insurance company to file with the relevant insurance Commissioner a confidential notice of the proposed divestiture at least thirty days prior to the cessation of control (unless a person acquiring control from the divesting party has filed notice of the proposed acquisition of control with the Commissioner). After receipt of the notice, the Commissioner must determine those instances in which the parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest will be required to file for or obtain approval of the transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of a direct or indirect parent of any of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries (including AHL) (in particular through an unsolicited transaction), even if the shareholders of such parent consider such transaction to be desirable. Our bye-laws include limitations on the voting power exercisable by shareholders of the Company other than the Apollo Group so that certain persons or groups (Control Groups) are deemed not to hold more than 9.9% of the total voting power conferred by our shares.
Holding company system regulations currently in effect in New York require prospective acquirers of New York domiciled insurers to provide detailed disclosure with respect to intended changes to the business operations of the insurer, and expressly authorize the NYSDFS to impose additional conditions on such acquisitions. Pursuant to these regulations, the NYSDFS may limit the changes that the acquirer may make to the insurer’s business operations for a specified period of time following the acquisition without the NYSDFS’ prior approval. In particular, the regulation provides the NYSDFS with the specific authority to require acquirers of New York domiciled life insurers to post assets in a trust account for the benefit of the target company’s policyholders. In making such determination, the NYSDFS may consider whether the acquirer is, or is controlled by or under common control with, an investment manager such as Apollo. The NAIC has also published in its Financial Analysis Handbook specific narrative guidance for state insurance examiners to consider in reviewing applications for an acquisition of insurance and reinsurance companies by a private equity firm.
Although Athene Re IV is not subject to insurance holding company laws, the Vermont insurance regulator may use all or a part of the holding company law framework described above in determining whether to approve a proposed change of control.
Each of the Athene Domiciliary States has adopted a form of the Amended Holding Company Model Act, which requires each ultimate controlling party to file an annual enterprise risk report identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies. An enterprise risk is an activity or event involving affiliates of an insurer that could have a material adverse effect on the insurer or the insurer’s holding company system.
In December 2014, the NAIC adopted additional amendments to the Amended Holding Company Model Act for consideration by the various states that address the authority of an insurance commissioner to act as the group-wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group or to acknowledge the authority of another regulatory official, from another jurisdiction, to so act. These changes to the Amended Holding Company Model Act must be enacted by the individual states before they will become effective, and specifically in Delaware, Iowa and New York for the changes to apply to our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Delaware has adopted a form of these changes to the Amended Holding Company Model Act, and Iowa has adopted similar provisions under a predecessor statute; however, these changes have not yet been adopted by New York and we cannot predict whether New York will do so in the future. However, the NAIC has made these changes to the Amended Holding Company Model Act part of its accreditation standards for state solvency regulation beginning January 1, 2020, which is likely to motivate states, including New York, to adopt these changes to the Amended Holding Company Model Act. It is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these changes may impose in the future.
In addition, the NAIC has adopted a revised Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation (SAT), which places new responsibilities upon issuing insurance companies with respect to the suitability of annuity sales, including responsibilities for training agents. Many states, including Athene Domiciliary States, have already enacted laws and/or regulations based on SAT, thus imposing suitability standards with respect to sales of FIAs and variable annuities. The NYSDFS issued a circular letter emphasizing insurers’ obligations under laws and regulations based on SAT when replacing a deferred annuity contract with an immediate annuity contract. The NAIC is also considering amendments to the SAT to incorporate a “best interest” or similar standard with respect to the suitability of annuity sales; however, the development of such amendments may be delayed until the NAIC has further clarity around the related federal rules which are expected to be proposed by the SEC and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) in 2019. On July 22, 2018, the NYSDFS issued amendments to its regulation based on SAT to incorporate a “best interest” standard with respect to the suitability of life insurance and annuity sales, which amendments take effect on August 1, 2019. Future changes in such laws and regulations, including those that impose a “best interest” standard could adversely impact the way we market and sell our annuity products.

BMA
Group Supervision – The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. An insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts exclusively, or mainly, insurance business. The BMA may make such determination where it ascertains that (1) the group is headed by a “specified insurer” (that is to say, it is headed by either a Class 3A, Class 3B or Class 4 general business insurer or a Class C, Class D or Class E long-term insurer or another class of insurer designated by order of the BMA); or (2) where the insurance group is not headed by a “specified insurer,” where it is headed by a parent company which is incorporated in Bermuda or (3) where the parent company of the group is not a Bermuda company, in circumstances in which the BMA is satisfied that the insurance group is directed and managed from Bermuda or the insurer with the largest balance sheet total is a specified insurer.
When the BMA determines that it should act as the group supervisor, it shall designate a specified insurer that is a member of the insurance group to be the designated insurer (Designated Insurer) and it shall give to the Designated Insurer and other competent authorities written notice of its intention to act as group supervisor.
As group supervisor, the BMA will perform a number of supervisory functions including (1) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities, (2) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of the insurance group, (3) carrying out an assessment of the insurance group’s compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures, (4) planning and coordinating, with other competent authorities, supervisory activities in respect of the insurance group, both as a going concern and in emergency situations, (5) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members and (6) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors (consisting of insurance regulators) in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above.
In carrying out its functions, the BMA may make rules for (1) assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and/or its members and (2) regulating intra-group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure.
Our Bermuda Reinsurance Subsidiaries are not currently subject to group supervision. The BMA may, however, exercise its authority to act as our group supervisor in the future.
