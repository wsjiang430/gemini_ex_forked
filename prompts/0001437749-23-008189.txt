Item 1.         Business
Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from serious diseases. DiaMedica’s lead candidate DM199 is the first pharmaceutically active recombinant (synthetic) form of the human tissue kallikrein-1 (KLK1) protein to be studied in patients. KLK1 is an established therapeutic modality in Asia for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and chronic kidney disease, including hypertensive nephrosclerosis (hypertension). We have also identified a potential novel treatment for inflammatory diseases, DM300, which is currently early in the preclinical stage of development. Our long-term goal is to use our patented and in-licensed technologies to establish our Company as a leader in the development and commercialization of therapeutic treatments from novel recombinant proteins. Our current focus is on the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). We plan to advance DM199, our lead drug candidate, through required clinical trials to create shareholder value by establishing its clinical and commercial potential as a therapy for AIS and CKD.
 
AIS and CKD patients suffer from impaired blood flow in the brain and kidneys, respectively. These patients also tend to exhibit lower than normal levels of endogenous (produced by the body) KLK1 protein, which is produced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. We believe treatment with DM199 could replenish levels of KLK1, thereby allowing the natural function of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) to release bradykinin (BK) in the body where and when needed, releasing nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins (PG) in synergy, via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathways, to relax smooth muscle in arteries to vasodilate the arteries and increase blood flow and oxygen.
 
In September 2021, we announced the initiation of the first site for our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of DM199 for the treatment of AIS and the first participant was enrolled in November 2021. The ReMEDy2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive trial intended to enroll approximately 350 participants at up to 75 sites in the United States. Participants enrolled in the trial will be treated with either DM199 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms. The trial excludes patients with large vessel occlusions and imaging evidence of brain damage and those treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or any other thrombolytic. The study population is representative of the approximately 80% of AIS patients who do not have treatment options today, primarily due to the limitations on treatment with mechanical thrombectomy or tPA, which must be dosed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset.
 
The ReMEDy2 trial has two separate, independent, primary endpoints and is powered for success with either endpoint: 1) physical recovery from stroke as measured by the well-established modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90, and 2) the rate of ischemic stroke recurrence through day 90. Secondary endpoints for the trial will evaluate, among other things, mRS shift (which shows the treatment effect on participants across the full spectrum of stroke severity), participant deaths and the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Barthel Index stroke scale. Recurrent strokes represent 25% of all ischemic strokes, often occurring in the first few weeks after an initial stroke and are typically more disabling, costly, and fatal than initial strokes.

On July 6, 2022, we announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a clinical hold on the investigational new drug application (IND) for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial. The clinical hold was issued following the Company voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the trial to investigate three unexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) occurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. The acutely low blood pressure levels in the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after the IV infusion was stopped, and the participants suffered no injuries. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold letter, on September 16, 2022, we submitted to the FDA supporting in-vitro data that the cause of the hypotensive events was likely related to switching to a new type of IV bag for use in the ReMEDy2 trial rather than continue with the type of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy 1 trial, where DM199 was generally safe and well tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. While there were no differences in the compatibility of DM199 with either type of IV bag, we observed significant differences in DM199 binding between the two types of IV bags used in the studies that we believe altered, and unintentionally elevated, the total amount of DM199 being administered to participants in the ReMEDy2 trial and thereby triggering the hypotensive events. In addition to our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotensive events, we also included in this FDA submission, proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these events, including a reduction in the DM199 dose level for the initial IV dose to effectively match the well tolerated IV dose administered in the ReMEDy1 trial. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to our submission, indicating that the FDA was continuing the clinical hold and requesting, among other items, an additional in-use in vitro stability study of the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the combination of the IV bag, IV tubing and any materials used during the infusion that come in contact with DM199 and the mechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of the hypotension events. In December 2022, we received written comments from the FDA clarifying its expectations for the design of the in-use study. These comments were incorporated into the study protocol and submitted to the FDA. In response the FDA recently indicated that the protocol appeared to be reasonable. The requested in-use study has been initiated and is being performed at an independent laboratory. The study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 simulates actual use in the hospital and part 2 tests worst-case scenarios such as varying storage durations, temperature(s) and light. Part 1 is complete. We believe data from part 1 confirms our conclusions from prior testing that the IV dose administered in the ReMEDy2 study was higher than planned due to the change in IV bag materials and was the cause of the hypotension, and that a dose revision in ReMEDy2 should avoid the clinically significant hypotension. We have submitted these results and conclusions to the FDA for feedback and to request confirmation that all issues of the clinical hold will have been addressed after submission of data from part 2 of the in-use testing anticipated in April 2023.
 
We have also proactively initiated a Phase 1C open label, single ascending dose (SAD) study of DM199 administered with the PVC IV bags used in the ReMEDy2 trial.  The purpose of the study is to confirm, with human data, the DM199 serum concentration level achieved with the IV dose and further evaluate safety and tolerability. In the event that the FDA does not agree that the results of the in-use study support the proposed dose revision, the data from this Phase 1C study can be used to support the rationale for the IV dose selected for the ReMEDy2 trial.  The Phase 1C study is being conducted in Australia and is intended to enroll up to 15 healthy, adult participants. Enrollment in the study has commenced and preliminary data is expected to be available in May 2023.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for the FDA to lift the clinical hold on a timely basis or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may subsequently make additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold, such as requiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than we recently proposed for our DM199 product candidate. We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 trial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial.
 
In September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS where tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy are not indicated or medically appropriate. The FDA may grant Fast Track designation to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. The FDA provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team for a Fast Track product, including pre-IND meetings, end-of-phase 1 meetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings with the FDA to discuss study design, extent of safety data required to support approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA reviews portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.

With respect to our Phase 2 REDUX trial of DM199 in CKD, interim data was presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) annual Kidney Week meeting in November 2021. In the IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) cohort, in addition to continuing to show statistically significant reductions (averaging over 30% decrease) in albuminuria in participants with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria, the trial also demonstrated early signals of potential disease modification with the APRIL and IgA1 biomarkers showing mean decreases of 35% and 22% overall, respectively, after three months of treatment. In the African American cohort, participants were hypertensive with CKD and non-diabetic. Participants in this cohort with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria saw a mean decrease in albuminuria of over 50%, improvement in blood pressure and stable estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). As of March 31, 2022, all participants had completed their treatment periods. We are currently evaluating next steps for our CKD program as we proceed with analyzing the complete data set from the REDUX trial.
 
We believe DM199 has the potential to treat a variety of diseases where restoring healthy function requires sufficient activity of KLK1 and its system, KKS. Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and the pancreas of pigs are approved and sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, CKD, retinopathy, hypertension and related vascular diseases. We believe millions of patients have been treated with these KLK1 therapies and the data from more than 200 published papers and studies support its clinical benefit. However, there are numerous regulatory, commercial and clinical drawbacks associated with KLK1 derived from these sources which can be overcome by developing a synthetic version of KLK1 such as DM199. We believe higher regulatory standards and potential antibody reactions are the primary reasons why KLK1 derived from these sources are not currently available and used in the United States or Europe. We are not aware of any recombinant version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor are we aware of any recombinant version in development other than our drug candidate, DM199.
 
Kallikrein-Kinin System
 
KLK1 is a serine protease, or protein, produced primarily in the kidneys, pancreas and salivary glands. KLK1 plays a critical role in the regulation of local blood flow and vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels, which decreases vascular resistance) in the body, as well as an important role in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress (an imbalance between potentially damaging reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, and antioxidants in the body).
 
KLK1 is involved in multiple biochemical processes. The most well-characterized activity of KLK1 is the enzymatic cleavage of low molecular weight kininogen (LMWK) to produce Lys-bradykinin (BK)-like peptides, collectively known as kinins, which activate BK receptors (primarily BK2R with some BK1R), see graphic below. Activation of BK receptors by kinins sets in motion metabolic pathways which locally produce nitric oxide, prostaglandins and other anti-inflammatory mediators that can improve blood flow (through vasodilation), dampen inflammation and protect tissues and end-organs from ischemic damage. Scientific literature, including publications in Circulation Research, Immunopharmacology and Kidney International, suggests that lower endogenous KLK1 levels in patients are associated with diseases related to vascular disorders, such as stroke, kidney diseases and hypertension. DM199, as a protein replacement therapy, may replenish KLK1 levels to properly activate the KKS driving the local production of nitric oxide, prostaglandins and other anti-inflammatory mediators, to promote endothelial health and protect the brain and kidney from damage. By providing additional supply of the KLK1 protein, DM199 treatment could potentially improve blood flow to and reduce inflammation in damaged end-organs, such as the brain and the kidneys, supporting their structural integrity and normal functioning.

DM199 (KLK1) and Our Therapeutic Hypothesis
 

We have conducted numerous internal and third-party analyses to demonstrate that DM199 is structurally and functionally equivalent to KLK1 derived from human urine. Specifically, the amino acid structure of DM199 is effectively identical to the human urine form, and the enzymatic and pharmacokinetic profiles are substantially similar to both human urine and porcine derived KLK1. The physiological effects of DM199 on blood pressure, from our completed studies, is similar to that of human urine and porcine-derived forms of KLK1. We believe that the results of this work suggest that the therapeutic action of DM199 will be the same or, potentially, better than that of the forms of KLK1 marketed in Asia.
 
We believe DM199 may provide new treatment options with significant benefits over the current standards of care by offering a therapeutic treatment option to a greater number of patients with the potential for fewer side effects.
 
Summary of Clinical Results
 
To date, clinical trials have been and/or are being conducted in the United States, Europe and Australia. We believe the clinical data generated to date by DM199 supports the continued development of DM199 as a treatment for AIS and CKD.

● | Our Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial of DM199 in the treatment of AIS (n=91) met our primary safety and tolerability end points and demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the number of participants with recurrent ischemic stroke (reported as stroke in evolution or stroke progression by the investigators) in the active treatment group: 0 (0%) participants treated with DM199 vs. 6 (13%) on placebo (p=0.012), with 4 of the 6 resulting in participant death. In a subgroup analysis of participants not receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment (n=46), patients treated with DM199 demonstrated a 22% absolute improvement in excellent outcomes (recovering to an NIHS score of 0-1). In participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. supportive care and/or tPA (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed to a full or nearly full recovery at 90 days (NIHSS: 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the placebo group. This represents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants achieving a full or nearly full recovery. Additionally, subject deaths decreased from 24% in the placebo group to 12% in the DM199 treatment group, a 50% relative reduction. This subgroup represents the participants most closely aligned with the target treatment population for DM199 in our ReMEDy2 trial.

● | Interim data from our Phase 2 REDUX trial of DM199 in CKD was presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s (ASN) annual Kidney Week meeting in November 2021. In the hypertensive African American cohort demonstrated an over 50% mean reduction in albuminuria in participants with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria and significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at the 2µg/kg dose level after three months of treatment. The IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) cohort, in addition to showing statistically significant reductions (averaging an over 30% decrease) in albuminuria in participants with moderate to severe baseline albuminuria, the trial also demonstrated early signals of potential disease modification with the APRIL and IgA1 average biomarker decreases of 35% and 22% overall, respectively, after three months of treatment.

In all completed studies, DM199 was shown to be generally safe and well tolerated. The primary adverse events noted in our studies with healthy volunteers included headache, erythema (redness), dizziness, venous puncture (blood draw) site reaction. The most common adverse events in people with diabetes with or without chronic kidney disease included orthostatic hypotension, local injection site irritation/redness, and diarrhea. The most common adverse events seen in people with acute ischemic stroke include constipation, oral candidiasis (yeast/fungal infection of mouth) and nausea.
 
Supporting Data for Use of DM199 (KLK1):
 
KLK1 derived from human urine was approved in China in 2005 and became the standard of care in 2010. KLK1 derived from the pancreas of pigs has been approved in Japan for several decades. There is one company selling human urine derived KLK1 in China. We believe that approximately 20 companies are marketing porcine KLK1 in Japan, China and Korea for hypertension, certain chronic kidney and other vascular diseases. We have identified several hundred papers supporting the clinical use of urinary and porcine derived KLK1 from China, Japan and Korea.
 
Studies have shown that lower KLK1 levels are also a predictor of stroke recurrence. The red line in the graph below represents patients in the lowest KLK1 quartile who were at the highest risk for recurrence of stroke. (2,478 stroke patients and event free survival over 5 years).

AIS Background and Disease Pathology
 
Acute Ischemic Stroke Background
 
Stroke is characterized by the rapidly developing loss of brain function due to a blockage of blood flow in the brain. As a result, the affected tissues of the brain become inactive and may eventually die. Strokes can be classified into two major categories: AIS and hemorrhagic stroke. AIS is characterized by interruption of the blood supply by a blood clot (ischemia), while a hemorrhagic stroke results from rupture, or bleeding, of a blood vessel in the brain. Risk factors for stroke include, among other things, advanced age, hypertension (high blood pressure), previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, physical inactivity and obesity.
 
   8

  

More specifically, with respect to an ischemic stroke, at the site of a blood flow blockage in the brain, there exist two major ischemic zones – the core ischemic zone with nearly complete loss of blood flow (blood flow below 10% to 25%), and the surrounding ischemic penumbra, a rim of mild to moderately ischemic tissue surrounding the core ischemic zone. Within minutes, the significant lack of blood flow in the core ischemic zone deprives these cells of glucose and oxygen which rapidly depletes energy stores and triggers the loss of ion gradients, ultimately leading to neuronal cell death, or apoptosis. The ischemic penumbra zone, however, may remain viable for several hours via collateral arteries that branch from the main occluded artery in the core ischemic zone. Unfortunately, the penumbra is at great risk of delayed tissue damage due to inflammation which may also lead to neuronal cell death. As time goes on, a lack of blood flow in the core ischemic zone (infarct) may lead to fluid buildup (edema) and swelling which creates intracranial pressure. This pressure on the brain leads to tissue compression resulting in additional ischemia. Additional events in AIS include vascular damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium, loss of structural integrity of brain tissue and blood vessels and inflammation. A stroke can lead to permanent damage with memory loss, speech problems, reading and comprehension difficulties, physical disabilities and emotional/behavioral problems. The long-term costs of stroke are substantial, with many patients requiring extended hospitalization, extended physical therapy or rehabilitation and/or long-term institutional or family care. However, provided the extended window of viability in the penumbra, next generation stroke therapies are being developed to protect valuable brain tissue during the hours to a week after a stroke.
 
Unmet Medical Need in AIS
 
According to the World Health Organization, each year approximately 1.7 million people in the U.S., Europe and Japan and approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke, of which 5 million will die and 5 million will be permanently disabled. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) approximately 87% of all strokes are ischemic in nature, meaning a blockage of blood flow in/to the brain. We believe that stroke represents an area of significant unmet medical need and a KLK1 therapy (such as DM199) could provide a significant patient benefit, in particular given its proposed treatment window of up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms. Currently, the only FDA-approved pharmacological intervention for AIS is tPA, which is approved to be given within 3 hours of symptom onset; however, we understand that based upon supplemental clinical research and common practice, it is typically administered up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset. Treating patients with tPA during this time window can be challenging because it is difficult to determine precisely when symptoms began and a patient must undergo brain imaging before treatment to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke, a ruptured blood vessel causing bleeding within the brain. Mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure which attempts to remove the clot using catheter-based tools, is also available to certain patients. Despite the availability of these treatments, we believe they are relevant to approximately 20% of ischemic stroke patients due to the location of the clot, the elapsed time after the stroke occurred or other safety considerations. Thus, we believe DM199 may offer significant advantages over the current treatment options in that it fills a serious, unmet need for patients who cannot receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy. Additionally, we believe DM199 may also offer a complementary follow-on treatment for patients who initially receive tPA or mechanical thrombectomy by enabling sustained blood flow improvements to the brain during the critical weeks and months after a stroke, reducing the risk of stroke recurrence.

Acute Ischemic Stroke Treatment Options
 

According to the CDC, stroke incidence in the United States and its related effects include:
 

● | Every year in the United States, approximately 800,000 people experience a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Approximately 600,000 of these are first events and approximately 25%, or 200,000, are recurrent stroke events.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Approximately one of every 20 deaths in the United States is caused by stroke and is the fifth leading cause of death. On average, someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds and someone dies from a stroke every 3.5 minutes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stroke is the leading cause of serious long-term disability and reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors aged 65 and over.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Risk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for African Americans as for Caucasians, and African Americans have the highest rate of death due to stroke.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Stroke-related costs in the United States came to nearly $53 billion between 2017 and 2018, including the cost of health care services, medications and missed days of work.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
DM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of AIS
 
As depicted in the graphic below, we believe DM199 has the potential to preserve “at risk” brain tissue by increasing cerebral blood flow. DM199 (KLK1) locally activates nitric oxide and prostaglandins to selectively vasodilate arteries in the ischemic penumbra and increase collateral blood flow, in particular in the at-risk penumbra area following a stroke to improve blood flow and oxygen levels to:
 

● | Improve stroke recovery – save cerebral tissue in the ischemic penumbra reducing the size and impact of the stroke
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce burden of stroke recurrence – improved collateral blood flow reduces the risk of arterial re-occlusion (stroke)

DM199 Acute Ischemic Stroke: Proposed Mechanism
 

In January 2019, we published a paper titled “Human Tissue Kallikrein in the Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke” in the peer reviewed journal, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders. The paper reviews the scientific literature covering the biochemical role of KLK1 and presents the mechanistic rationale for using KLK1 as an additional pharmacological treatment for AIS. In addition to the biochemical mechanism of KLK1, the review highlights supporting results from human genetics and preclinical animal models of brain ischemia. It also reviews published clinical results for treatment of AIS by a form of KLK1 that is isolated from human urine. This form has been approved for post-infarct treatment of AIS in China and data has been published from clinical trials involving over 4,000 patients. The paper offers a series of testable therapeutic hypotheses for demonstrating the long-term beneficial effect of KLK1 treatment in AIS patients and the reasons for this action.
 
We are developing DM199 to treat AIS patients with a therapeutic window of up to 24 hours after the first sign of symptoms, well beyond the current window of up to 4.5 hours from symptom onset for tPA, thereby filling a large unmet need for those patients who cannot receive tPA under the currently available treatment window of tPA. This important attribute could potentially make therapy available to the millions of patients worldwide who currently have limited treatment options.
 
Supporting Data from the Use of Urine-derived KLK1 for the Treatment of AIS in China
 
In China, Kailikang® is approved and marketed by Techpool Bio-Pharma Inc., a company controlled by Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co. Ltd. Kailikang has been approved for the treatment of AIS in China. We believe the initial treatment window is up to 48 hours after stroke symptom onset. Based on IQVIA data, other publications and our own internal analysis, we estimate that over 600,000 stroke patients were treated in 2021 with Kailikang in China. More than 50 published clinical studies, covering over 4,000 stroke patients, have demonstrated a beneficial effect of Kailikang treatment in AIS including improvements in standard stroke scores, increased blood flow, reduced infarct size/ischemia in the brain. According to a publication in the China Journal of Neurology, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 446 participants treated with either Kailikang or a placebo with initial treatment administered up to 48 hours after symptom onset showed significantly better scores on the European Stroke Scale and Activities of Daily Living at three weeks post-treatment and after three months using the Barthel Index.
 
Additionally, a comprehensive meta-analysis covering 24 clinical studies involving 2,433 patients published in the Journal of Evidence-Based Medicine concluded that human urinary KLK1 appears to ameliorate neurological deficits for patients with AIS and improves long-term outcomes, though a few treated patients suffered from transient hypotension.
 
   11

  

Furthermore, in a retrospective study covering 300 consecutive AIS patients, published in Brain and Behavior March 2018, patients treated with human urinary KLK1 experienced a 6.5% absolute reduction (p=0.009) in recurrent strokes (39% relative) within one year.
 
CKD Background and Disease Pathology
 
Chronic Kidney Disease Background
 
CKD is characterized by a progressive decline in overall kidney function as measured by the eGFR, a test used to evaluate blood flow through the kidneys, and albuminuria, a marker for glomerular injury which is a measure of the amount of albumin protein excreted in your urine and an indicator for how well the kidneys are filtering excess fluid and waste products out of your blood. As glomerular filtration decreases, the body’s ability to continue to regulate its many functions, including the elimination of metabolic waste, is lost and ultimately, may result in severe physiologic consequences. Among multiple underlying causes, CKD often begins with an increase in blood glucose which leads to the thickening of the glomerular membrane, known as fibrosis. As the kidney function becomes impaired, eGFR generally decreases and albuminuria generally increases. Increased albuminuria means that abnormal amounts of protein are released into the urine collecting tubules of the kidney through damaged capillary pores in the glomerular floor. Additionally, increased blood glucose leads to increased blood pressure, elevated reactive oxygen species, advanced glycation end product formation (harmful compounds that are formed when protein or fat combine with sugar in the bloodstream) and inflammation. As these continue, structural components of the kidney begin to collapse, resulting in cell ischemia and cell death. As the renal damage continues, a progressive thickening of the glomerular basement membrane is seen along with continued pathological changes in the cells and inflammation. Early stages of CKD are characterized as microalbuminuria (small amounts of protein leak into the urine). Late stages are characterized as macroalbuminuria (large amounts of protein leak into the urine). The rate of decline depends on a number of factors including the type of diabetes, genetic predisposition, glycemic controls and blood pressure. At the final stages of CKD, the kidneys fail completely and dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed.
 
Unmet Medical Need in CKD
 
CKD is a widespread health problem that generates significant economic burden throughout the world:
 

● | According to the National Kidney Foundation, 37 million Americans have CKD and 1 in 3 Americans are at-risk for kidney disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The primary causes of CKD are diabetes (Type 2 and Type 1) and hypertension. The Medical Clinics of North America estimates that over 40% of those with Type 2 diabetes and 20% of those with Type 1 diabetes will eventually develop CKD, making it one of the more common risks for diabetics.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with CKD are at greater risk for hypertension and heart disease.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently, there is no cure for CKD and treatment primarily involves management of the symptoms of the disease in order to reduce the rate of decline in kidney function. Blood pressure medications, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), are often prescribed to control hypertension, and hopefully, slow the progression of CKD. Recently sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) have received approval to expand their label to treat diabetic kidney disease to reduce the rate of cardiovascular events. Nevertheless, according to the National Kidney Foundation, many of these patients continue to show declining kidney function and 3.6% of the overall population has a lifetime risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), where dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed. We believe DM199 offers a potentially novel approach for the treatment of CKD because KLK1 protein plays a vital role in normal kidney function.

DM199 – Our Novel Solution for the Treatment of CKD, Including Hypertensive Nephrosclerosis
 
We believe DM199 has the potential to offer meaningful therapeutic benefits for CKD patients. We believe that the KLK1 protein plays a vital role in maintaining normal kidney function, promoting the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin and other anti-inflammatory mediators which are important for kidney health and integrity. Patients with moderate to severe CKD often excrete abnormally low levels of KLK1 in their urine, leading to the hypothesis that a KLK1 deficit contributes to disease progression.
 
Additionally, KLK1 is the main source of bradykinin (BK) in resting conditions. BK opposes the prohypertensive renin, angiotensin, aldosterone system (RAAS) by restoring regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (EnaC) and increasing sodium and fluid excretion. DM199 augments low KLK1 levels and promotes natriuresis (excretion of sodium in urine). This regulation of EnaC with DM199 may contribute to lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients and in particular in patient’s considered to be salt-sensitive.
 
By providing additional KLK1, we believe DM199 has the potential to:
 

Further supporting the hypothesis that an intact KKS is critical for normal kidney function, a series of observational studies published in Immunopharmacology showed the amount of KLK1 released into the urine appears to be inversely correlated with the severity of disease in patients with CKD. Urinary KLK1 excretion was decreased in patients with both mild (not requiring dialysis) and severe (kidney failure/hemodialysis) renal disease compared to controls. Decreases in urinary KLK1 activity were seen especially when the reduction was associated with decreased glomerular filtration rate.
 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels to maintain, or possibly restore, kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, primarily slow the rate of decline in kidney function but are associated with side effects. Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that part of the beneficial effect of ACEi drugs involves preventing the normal breakdown of BK leading to substantial increases in BK levels throughout the body. However, these effects can be unregulated and ACEi drugs therefore can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as persistent cough, angioedema (swelling of skin and tissue) and hyperkalemia (abnormally high potassium levels that can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death). Most importantly, even with the use of ACEi or ARB medications in CKD patients, there remains high unmet need as a majority of CKD patients still experience a progressive loss of renal function over time. We believe DM199 treatment, either alone or in combination with an ARB, could potentially restore normal KLK1 levels allowing the KKS to perform its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects.

We intend to seek approval for use of DM199 as a novel therapy for CKD. Protein replacement therapy with DM199, through the activation of the KKS, may complement and balance RAAS, primarily targeted by ACEis and ARBs, and may potentially improve the function of the diseased renal system by improving blood flow and vasodilation, as well as reducing blood pressure.
 
Supporting Data from the Use of Porcine-Derived KLK1 for the Treatment of CKD in Japan, China and Korea
 
KLK1 derived from the pancreas of pigs is currently used to treat CKD in Japan, China and Korea. Specifically, porcine KLK1 is also used to treat hypertension and retinopathy. Based on data published by the data analytics company IQVIA and our own internal analysis, we estimate that millions of patients have been treated with porcine KLK1 for these and other vascular diseases. We have identified 17 clinical papers, supporting the therapeutic activity of porcine KLK1 in CKD patients, whether given alone or in combination with an ARB. These unblinded studies involve treatment durations ranging from a few weeks up to six months and report improvement in kidney disease based on decreased urinary albumin excretion rates and other clinical endpoints of kidney disease.
 
Our Competition and Current Treatments for Acute Ischemic Stroke and Chronic Kidney Disease 
 
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapidly advancing technologies that focus on rapid development of proprietary drugs. We believe that our DM199 product candidate, development capabilities, experience and scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages. However, we face significant potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for competitive products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize, thus limiting our market share and resulting in a longer period before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our DM199 product candidate.
 
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of competitive product candidates.
 
We also compete for staff, development and clinical resources. These competitors may impair our ability to recruit or retain qualified scientific and management personnel, our ability to work with specific advisors, or our ability to work with clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest or capacity constraints, and may also delay recruitment of clinical study sites and study volunteers, impeding progress in our development programs.
 
We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government or other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more effective or less expensive than any products that we may develop.

Acute Ischemic Stroke
 
Currently, there is one approved pharmaceutical treatment for AIS. That treatment is tPA (marketed under the brand name Activase®), and its therapeutic window is limited to up to 4.5 hours after the AIS. There are, however, a number of companies that are actively pursuing a variety of approaches to develop pharmaceutical products for the treatment of AIS including, among others:

● | Stem cells (Athersys, Inc.)
--+----------------------------


● | tPA extended treatment window (Genentech / Boehringer Ingelheim)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tenecteplase (Genentech / Boehringer Ingelheim)
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Cerebral edema (Biogen Inc.)
--+-----------------------------


● | Anti-inflammatory and clot dissolving (Biogen Inc.)
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Cell protection and anti-inflammation (ZZ Biotech LLC)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Inhibiting platelet aggregation (Acticor Biotech SAS)
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Neuroprotector (Mitsubishi)
--+----------------------------

 
There is a large unmet therapeutic need for AIS treatments that can be administered beyond the 4.5-hour time window of tPA. With this large unmet therapeutic need, there is significant competition to develop new therapeutic options. New therapeutic options in development include tissue protection focused therapies (deliverable from hours to days after the stroke) that are intended to preserve and protect brain cells beyond the tPA therapeutic window. Currently, the most advanced treatments involve the mechanical removal of blood clots in the large arteries supplying blood to the brain through sophisticated catheter-based approaches, referred to as mechanical thrombectomy. According to published research, use of mechanical thrombectomy is growing and the window of time after a stroke where the procedure can be used is widening. The goal is to provide treatment options for the vast majority of AIS patients who do not receive hospital care early enough to qualify for tPA therapy. We believe there is a very significant market opportunity for a drug that has a therapeutic window beyond that of tPA and is able to obtain regulatory approval.
 
Chronic Kidney Disease
 
CKD is primarily associated with diabetes and hypertension along with other disease states. In the United States, we are aware of only two currently approved treatments for CKD. These treatments include an ACEi (marketed under the brand name Captopril®) which is approved for the treatment of patients with CKD caused by Type 1 diabetes and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (marketed under the brand names INVOKANA® and Farxiga®) is approved to reduce the risk of ESRD, worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine.
 
There are several pharmaceutical products for the treatment of CKD currently in clinical development, some of which include:
 

● | Mineralcorticortisteroid receptor agonist (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chymase inhibitor (Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals LLC)
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Transient receptor potential canonical channel 5 (Goldfinch Bio)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | CCR2 receptor antagonists (ChemoCentryx, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Oxidative stress, cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitors (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Glycosylation inhibitors (Glycadia, Inc. aka Glycadia Pharmaceuticals)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   15

  


● | Endothelin A receptor antagonists (Chinook therapeutics, Inc.)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyclin nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Pfizer Inc.)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aldosterone synthase inhibitors (Cincor Pharma/AstraZeneca, Mineralys Therapeutics)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Aldosterone receptor antagonists (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nitric oxide enzyme inhibitor (GenKyoTex SA)
--+---------------------------------------------

 
Current treatment strategies for CKD include the strict control of high blood pressure and high blood sugar. The ACEi drug Captopril® is approved for use in patients with CKD due to Type 1 diabetes and both ACEi and ARBs are widely prescribed to slow the progression of CKD. Note however that the treatment with ACEi has been linked to hyperkalemia (elevated blood potassium levels), which increases the risk for abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. In fact, two clinical trials investigating the use of ACEi and ARB combination therapy in kidney disease were stopped prematurely because participants developed hyperkalemia. The added complication of hyperkalemia may result in patients receiving smaller, or suboptimal, doses or patients being untreated because they cannot tolerate the treatment. Additional side effects with ACEi treatment are angioedema (swelling of skin tissue) and persistent cough.
 
INVOKANA® (canagliflozin) and other SGLT-2 inhibitors are approved for use in patients to reduce the risk of ESRD, worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with Type 2 diabetes and DKD with a certain amount of protein in the urine. Potential side effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors include lower limb amputations, dehydration, diabetic ketoacidosis and genital mycotic infections.
 
We are aware of one approved treatment for IgAN, a disease which leads to CKD. On December 15, 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Calliditas Therapeutics AB’s “TARPEYO™” (budesonide) for the reduction of albuminuria in adult primary IgAN patients at risk of rapid disease progression, generally indicated by a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5g/g. TARPEYO (developed under the project name NEFECON) was specifically designed for and is the first and only FDA-approved treatment in this disease. It has not been established whether TARPEYO slows kidney function decline in patients with IgAN and continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory clinical trial. Additionally, there are several pharmaceutical products specifically for the treatment of IgAN currently in clinical development, some of which include:
 

● | Dual acting ARB and endothelin receptor antagonist (Travere Therapeutics, Inc.)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Antibody MASP-2 inhibitor (Omeros Corporation)
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Small-molecule inhibitor of complement factor B (Novartis AG)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Small-molecule inhibitor Nrf2 activator/NFkB inhibitor (Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | APRIL inhibitor (Vera Therapeutic and Chinook Therapeutics)
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 
DM199 treatment is intended to directly replenish KLK1 levels, maintaining or potentially restoring kidney function. Current treatment options, especially ACEi drugs, only partially restore kidney function and are associated with high-risk side effects. ACEi drugs can generate excessive BK where it is not needed, potentially leading to side effects such as cough and angioedema. DM199 treatment may potentially allow KLK1 to follow its normal physiological processes and release BK when and where it is needed, avoiding these side effects.

DM199 Clinical Trials
 
AIS Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 Trial
 
In September 2021, we announced the initiation of the first site for our pivotal ReMEDy2 trial, a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of DM199 for the treatment of AIS and the first participant was enrolled in November 2021. The ReMEDy2 trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 adaptive trial intended to enroll approximately 350 participants at up to 75 sites in the United States. Participants enrolled in the trial will be treated with either DM199 or placebo within 24 hours of the onset of AIS symptoms. The trial excludes patients with large vessel occlusions and imaging evidence of brain damage and those treated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or any other thrombolytic. The study population is representative of the approximately 80% of AIS patients who do not have treatment options today, primarily due to the limitations on treatment with mechanical thrombectomy or tPA, which must be dosed within 4.5 hours from symptom onset.
 
The ReMEDy2 trial has two separate, independent, primary endpoints and is powered for success with either endpoint: 1) physical recovery from stroke as measured by the well-established modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90, and 2) the rate of ischemic stroke recurrence through day 90. Secondary endpoints for the trial will evaluate, among other things, mRS shift (which shows the treatment effect on participants across the full spectrum of stroke severity), participant deaths and the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Barthel Index stroke scale. Recurrent strokes represent 25% of all ischemic strokes, often occurring in the first few weeks after an initial stroke and are typically more disabling, costly, and fatal than initial strokes.
 
On July 6, 2022, we announced that the FDA placed a clinical hold on the IND for our Phase 2/3 ReMEDy2 trial. The clinical hold was issued following the Company voluntarily pausing participant enrollment in the trial to investigate three unexpected instances of clinically significant hypotension (low blood pressure) occurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199. The acutely low blood pressure levels in the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after the IV infusion was stopped, and the participants suffered no injuries. In response to the FDA’s clinical hold letter, on September 16, 2022, we submitted to the FDA supporting in-vitro data that the cause of the hypotensive events was likely related to switching to a new type of IV bag for use in the ReMEDy2 trial rather than continue with the type of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy 1 trial, where DM199 was generally safe and well tolerated and no hypotensive episodes were reported. While there were no differences in the compatibility of DM199 with either type of IV bag, we observed significant differences in DM199 binding between the two types of IV bags used in the studies that we believe altered, and unintentionally elevated, the total amount of DM199 being administered to participants in the ReMEDy2 trial and thereby triggering the hypotensive events. In addition to our analysis of the events leading to and causing the hypotensive events, we also included in this FDA submission, proposed protocol modifications to address the mitigation of these events, including a reduction in the DM199 dose level for the initial IV dose to effectively match the well tolerated IV dose administered in the ReMEDy1 trial. Following review of this data, the FDA responded to our submission, indicating that the FDA was continuing the clinical hold and requesting, among other items, an additional in-use in vitro stability study of the IV administration of DM199, which includes testing the combination of the IV bag, IV tubing and any materials used during the infusion that come in contact with DM199 and the mechanical infusion pump, to further rule out any other cause of the hypotension events. In December 2022, we received written comments from the FDA clarifying its expectations for the design of the in-use study. These comments were incorporated into the study protocol and submitted to the FDA. In response the FDA recently indicated that the protocol appeared to be reasonable. The requested in-use study has been initiated and is being performed at an independent laboratory. The study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 simulates actual use in the hospital and part 2 tests worst-case scenarios such as varying storage durations, temperature(s) and light. Part 1 is complete. DiaMedica believes data from part 1 confirms its conclusions from prior testing that the IV dose administered in the ReMEDy2 study was higher than planned due to the change in IV bag materials and was the cause of the hypotension, and that a dose revision in ReMEDy2 should avoid the clinically significant hypotension. We have submitted these results and conclusions to the FDA for feedback and to request confirmation  that all issues of the clinical hold will have been addressed after submission of the data from part 2 of the in-use testing anticipated in April 2023.
 
We also have proactively initiated a Phase 1C open label, single ascending dose (SAD) study of DM199 administered with the PVC IV bags used in the ReMEDy2 trial.  The purpose of the study is to confirm, with human data, the DM199 serum concentration level achieved with the IV dose and further evaluate safety and tolerability. In the event that the FDA does not agree that the results of the in-use study support the proposed dose revision, the data from this Phase 1C study can be used to support the rationale for the IV dose selected for the ReMEDy2 trial.  The Phase 1C study is being conducted in Australia and is intended to enroll up to 15 health, adult participants. Enrollment in the study has commenced and preliminary data is expected to be available in May 2023.
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully respond to the FDA’s latest questions sufficiently for the FDA to lift the clinical hold on a timely basis or at all. It is also possible that the FDA may subsequently make additional requests that we would need to fulfill prior to the lifting of the clinical hold, such as requiring us to complete additional clinical testing or imposing stricter approval conditions than we recently proposed for our DM199 product candidate. We may not enroll any additional participants in the ReMEDy2 trial until we provide the FDA with the requested data and the FDA notifies us that the FDA has lifted the clinical hold and we may resume enrollment in the clinical trial.
 
   17

  

Prior to voluntarily halting enrollment, we had experienced slower than expected site activations and enrollment in our ReMEDy2 trial and may continue to experience these conditions if and when we are able to resume enrollment. We believe this was due to a number of factors, including the reduction or suspension of research activities at our current and targeted clinical study sites, as well as staffing shortages, due to COVID-19 and concerns managing logistics and protocol compliance for participants discharged from the hospital to an intermediate care facility. We intend to continue to take certain actions, including bringing certain site engagement responsibilities in-house and engaging a clinical services consulting firm to provide staff support to study sites as needed, to assist study sites in overcoming these issues, if and when we resume enrollment in the ReMEDy2 trial, however no assurances can be provided as to if and when these issues will resolve.
 
In September 2021, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to DM199 for the treatment of AIS where tPA and/or mechanical thrombectomy are not indicated or medically appropriate. The FDA may grant Fast Track designation to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. The FDA provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team for a Fast Track product, including pre-IND meetings, end-of-phase 1 meetings and end-of-phase 2 meetings with the FDA to discuss study design, extent of safety data required to support approval, dose-response concerns, and use of biomarkers. A Fast Track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA reviews portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
 
AIS Phase 2 ReMEDy1 Trial
 
In May 2020, we announced top-line data from our Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial assessing the safety, tolerability and markers of therapeutic efficacy of DM199 in patients suffering from AIS. We initiated treatment in this trial in February 2018 and completed enrollment in October 2019 with 92 participants. The study drug (DM199 or placebo) was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion within 24 hours of stroke symptom onset, followed by subcutaneous injections later that day and once every 3 days for 21 days. The trial was designed to measure safety and tolerability along with multiple tests designed to investigate DM199’s therapeutic potential including plasma-based biomarkers and standard functional stroke measures assessed at 90 days post-stroke. Standard functional stroke measurements include the Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the Barthel Index and C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation. The trial met primary safety and tolerability endpoints and was generally safe and well tolerated. In addition, there was a demonstrated therapeutic effect on the rate of severe stroke recurrence inclusive of all participants and there was also a demonstrated therapeutic effect on the physical recoveries of participants that received tPA prior to enrollment but not in participants receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment.
 
   18

  

Prior to enrollment, 44 of the 91 evaluable participants (48%) received mechanical thrombectomy intervention, a catheter-based treatment intended to physically remove clots and potentially available for patients who have a large vessel occlusion and can be treated within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. While approximately 20% of AIS patients are believed to be eligible for a mechanical thrombectomy, currently only about 5% to 10% receive the treatment due to elapsed time post-stroke or unavailability of the therapy at the hospital where the patient presents. DM199 is intended to treat the approximately 80% of AIS patients who are not eligible for either mechanical thrombectomy or tPA. Treatment for these patients is limited to supportive care. Due to the large volume of participants receiving mechanical thrombectomy prior to enrollment in the ReMEDy1 trial, and a disproportionate distribution of these participants between the active treatment and placebo groups, DM199 did not produce a therapeutic effect on physical recoveries in the overall trial analysis.
 
When participants treated with mechanical thrombectomy are excluded from the trial data set, which represents the group of participants most closely aligned with the target treatment population for DM199 in the ReMEDy2 trial, a positive therapeutic effect on participant physical recoveries was demonstrated. As shown in the table below, when evaluating the participants treated with DM199 (n=25) vs. supportive care and/or tPA (n=21), the results showed that 36% of participants receiving DM199 progressed to a full or nearly full recovery at 90 days (NIHSS: 0-1), compared to 14% of participants in the placebo group. This represents a 22% absolute increase in the proportion of participants achieving a full or nearly full recovery. Additionally, subject deaths decreased from 24% in the placebo group to 12% in the active therapy group, a 50% relative reduction. Note that the number of subjects in these subsets were insufficient for statistical significance.
 
DM199 vs. Supportive Care and/or tPA
 

 | NIHSS Outcomes at 90 Days
---------------+--------------------------
 | | 0-1 | | 2-8 | | ≥ 9 | Death
Placebo (n=21) | | 14 | % | | 57 | % | | 5 | % | 24 | %
DM199 (n=25) | | 36 | % | | 36 | % | | 16 | % | 12 | %

 
In addition, in the evaluable participants (n=91), a significant reduction in the number of participants with recurrent ischemic stroke was noted in the active treatment group: 0 (0%) participants treated with DM199 vs. 6 (13%) on placebo (p=0.012), with 4 of the 6 resulting in participant death.
 
We believe these findings from our Phase 2 ReMEDy1 trial, which are consistent with the use of Kailikang in China, provide a signal that recombinant human KLK1 appears safe and may have promise as a new treatment for physicians who have limited options for the treatment of patients following an AIS.
 
CKD Phase 2 REDUX Trial
 
In October 2019, the FDA accepted our Phase 2 clinical trial protocol for the treatment of CKD caused by rare or significant unmet diseases. Enrollment commenced in December 2019 and was completed in December 2021. The trial named REDUX, Latin for restore, is a multi-center, open-label investigation of participants with mild or moderate CKD (Stage II or III) and albuminuria. The trial was conducted in the United States and was focused on participants with CKD: Cohort 1 was focused on non-diabetic, hypertensive African Americans (AA) with Stage II or III CKD. African Americans are at greater risk for CKD than Caucasians, and those African Americans who have the APOL1 gene mutation are at an even higher risk. Cohort 2 was focused on participants with IgA Nephropathy. Cohort 3 was focused on participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with CKD, hypertension and albuminuria (DKD). The trial evaluated two dose levels of DM199 within each cohort. Study participants received DM199 by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 95 days. The primary study endpoints, evaluated after three months of treatment, included safety, tolerability, blood pressure, albuminuria and kidney function, which are evaluated by changes from baseline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, as measured by the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio.
 
   19

  

In June 2021 we announced interim results and in November 2021 we announced additional interim results. The interim results indicated that DM199, after three months of treatment, was demonstrating clinically meaningful improvements in kidney function in Cohorts 1 and 2, as measured by simultaneously stabilizing estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and decreasing the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). Additionally, in participants who were hypertensive (Cohorts 1 and 3), DM199 reduced blood pressure by clinically significant levels and importantly, there was no effect on participants who were not hypertensive (Cohort 2). We reported the following preliminary data:
 

● | AA: Geometric mean decrease in UACR of -55% in moderate to severe albuminuria (baseline UACR >500 µg/mg) (n=3), Stable eGFR from baseline (n=12) and a mean decrease in systolic/diastolic blood pressure -19/-13 mmHg (n=8) at the 2 µg/kg dose level;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | IgAN: UACR geometric mean decrease of -34% (p=0.002) (baseline UACR>500 µg/mg) (n=11), eGFR and blood pressure were stable (n=16) and mean decreases in the biomarkers April and IgA1 of 35% and 22% overall, respectively; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | DKD: No overall treatment effect was observed for UACR, however, reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n=28) were observed.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
DM199 was generally safe and well tolerated across all cohorts. AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most common being local injection site irritation, and all resolved without medical intervention.
 
We completed enrollment in REDUX with a total 84 subjects enrolled, including 24 African American subjects into Cohort 1, 25 subjects with IgAN into Cohort 2 and 35 subjects with Type 2 diabetes in Cohort 3. As of March 31, 2022, all participants had completed their treatment periods. We are currently evaluating next steps for our CKD program as we proceed with continuing to analyze the complete data set from the REDUX trial.
 
CKD Phase 1b
 
In July 2019, we completed a Phase 1b clinical trial of DM199 in participants with moderate or severe CKD caused by Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. The trial was performed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of three dose levels of DM199 (3, 5 and 8 µg/kg), administered in a single subcutaneous dose, as well as the evaluation of safety, tolerability and secondary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints. The trial results demonstrated that at the 3µg/kg dose level, the PK profiles were similar between moderate and severe CKD participants, and consistent with healthy subjects (normal kidney function) tested previously. Additionally, DM199 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting tolerability observed. There were no deaths, no discontinuations due to a treatment-related adverse event (AE) and no treatment-related significant adverse events (SAEs). AEs were minor and consistent with standard treatment(s) in the CKD patient population. We announced favorable overall interim PD results from the first 28 subjects that included short-term improvements in NO levels, average increase of 35%, PG levels, average increase of 41%, eGFR, average increase of 4.08 mL/min/1732, and the UACR excluding subjects with normal UACR levels at baseline, average decrease of 18.7%. PD results appeared to be drug related in that the greatest improvements occurred approximately 24 hours after DM199 administration and subsequently declined.

Potential DM199 Commercial Advantages
 
Several researchers have studied the structural and functional properties of KLK1. This deep body of knowledge has revealed the potential clinical benefits of KLK1 treatments. Today, forms of KLK1 derived from human urine and the pancreas of pigs are approved and sold in Japan, China and Korea to treat AIS, CKD, retinopathy, hypertension and related diseases. We are not aware of any recombinant version of KLK1 with regulatory approval for human use in any country, nor any recombinant version in development other than our drug candidate DM199. We believe at least five companies have attempted, unsuccessfully, to create a recombinant version of KLK1.
 
The growing understanding of the role of KLK1 in human health and its use in Asia as an approved therapeutic highlight two important potential commercial advantages for DM199:
 

● | KLK1 treatment is sold in Japan, China and Korea. Research has shown that patients with low levels of KLK1 are associated with a variety of diseases related to vascular dysfunction, such as AIS, CKD, retinopathy and hypertension. Clinical trial data with human urine and porcine derived KLK1 has demonstrated statistically significant clinical benefits in treating a variety of patients with KLK1 compared to placebo. These efficacy results are further substantiated by established markets in Japan, China and Korea for pharmaceutical sales of KLK1 derived from human urine and the pancreas of pigs. We estimate that millions of patients have been treated with these forms of KLK1 in Asia. Altogether, we believe this supports a strong market opportunity for a recombinant version of KLK1 such as DM199.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | KLK1 treatment has had limited side effects and has been well tolerated in studies to date. KLK1 is naturally produced by the human body; and, therefore, the body’s own control mechanisms act to limit potential side effects. The side effect observed to limit participant tolerability in our clinical trials was orthostatic hypotension, or a sudden drop in blood pressure, which has been primarily seen at doses 10 to 20 times higher than our anticipated therapeutic dose levels. Most recently, clinically significant, transient hypotension (low blood pressure) occurring shortly after initiation of the intravenous (IV) dose of DM199 was experienced by three participants in our ReMEDy2 trial which were the cause of the Company pausing participant enrollment and the FDA placing a clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 trial. The blood pressure levels of the three participants recovered back to their baseline blood pressure within minutes after IV infusion was stopped and the participants suffered no injuries. We believe that these events were caused by our switching away from the type of IV bag used in the prior ReMEDy1 trial, where no hypotensive episodes were reported, which resulted in an unintended, elevated dose of DM199 being delivered in the ReMEDy2 trial. We believe that by reducing the dose rate for the IV infusion to a level that matches the effective dose rate in the ReMEDy1 trial, we can manage and/or eliminate the clinically significant hypotensive events.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moreover, we understand that routine clinical use of KLK1 treatment in Asia has been well-tolerated by patients for several decades. In 2017, we completed a clinical trial comparing the pharmacokinetic profile of DM199 to the human urinary form of KLK1 (Kailikang), which showed DM199, when administered in intravenous form, had a similar pharmacokinetic profile. Further, when DM199 was administered subcutaneously, DM199 demonstrated a longer acting pharmacokinetic profile, superior to the intravenously administered Kailikang and DM199.

In addition, we believe that there are also significant formulation, manufacturing, regulatory and other advantages for recombinant human KLK1 drug candidate DM199:
 

● | Potency and Impurity Considerations. KLK1 produced from human urine or the pancreas of pigs presents risks related to preventing impurities, endotoxins, and chemical byproducts due to the inherent variability of the isolation and purification process. We believe that this creates the risk of inconsistencies in potency and impurities from one production run to the next. However, we expect to produce a consistent formulation of KLK1 that is free of endotoxins and other impurities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cost and Scalability. Large quantities of human urine and the pancreas of pigs must be obtained to derive a small amount of KLK1. This creates potential procurement, cost and logistical challenges to source the necessary raw material, particularly for human urine sourced KLK1. Once sourced, the raw material is processed using chemicals and costly capital equipment and produces a significant amount of byproduct waste. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials and can be readily scaled for commercial production. Accordingly, we believe our manufacturing process will have significant cost and scalability advantages.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Regulatory. We are not aware of any attempts by manufacturers of the urine or porcine based KLK1 products to pursue regulatory approvals in the United States. We believe that this is related to challenges presented by using inconsistent and potentially hazardous biomaterials, such as human urine and the pancreas of pigs, and their resulting ability to produce a consistent drug product. Our novel recombinant manufacturing process utilizes widely available raw materials which we believe provides a significant regulatory advantage, particularly in regions such as the United States, Europe and Canada, where safety standards are high. In addition, we believe that DM199 could qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
From a strategic perspective, we continue to believe that strategic alternatives with respect to our DM199 product candidate, including licenses and business collaborations, with other regional and global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be important in advancing the clinical development of DM199. Therefore, as a matter of course and from time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding these matters.
 
Regulatory Approval
 
Securing regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products in the United States, Europe, Canada and other commercial territories is a long and costly process that is controlled by each territory’s national regulatory agency. The national regulatory agency in the United States is the FDA, in Europe it is the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and in Canada it is Health Canada. Other national regulatory agencies have similar regulatory approval processes, but each national regulatory agency has its own approval processes. Approval in the United States, Europe or Canada does not assure approval by other national regulatory agencies, although often test results from one country may be used in applications for regulatory approval in another country.
 
Prior to obtaining regulatory approval to market a drug product, every national regulatory agency has a variety of statutes and regulations which govern the principal development activities. These laws require controlled research and testing of products, governmental review, and approval of a submission containing preclinical and clinical data establishing the safety and efficacy of the product for each use sought, approval of manufacturing facilities including adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMP) during production and storage, and control of marketing activities, including advertising, labeling and pricing approval.
 
   22

  

None of our product candidates have been completely developed or tested; and, therefore, we are not yet in a position to seek regulatory approval in any territory to market any of our product candidates.
 
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our current or future product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
U.S. Approval Process
 
In the United States, the FDA is responsible for the drug approval process. The FDA’s mission is to ensure that all medications on the market are safe and effective. The FDA’s approval process examines and thoroughly reviews potential new drugs; only those that are in compliance with the Code of Regulations, 21 CFR 312 and 21 CFR 314 are approved.
 
The U.S. food and drug regulations require licensing of manufacturing facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and approval of test results prior to marketing of therapeutic products, and adherence to GMP, as defined by each licensing jurisdiction, during production.
 
A description of the different stages in the drug approval process in the United States follows.
 
Stage 1: Preclinical Research. After an experimental drug is discovered, research is conducted to help determine its potential for treating or curing an illness. This is called preclinical research. Animal and/or bench studies are conducted to determine if there are any harmful effects of the drug and to help understand how the drug works. Information from these experiments is submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA reviews the information in the IND and decides if the drug is safe to study in humans.
Stage 2: Clinical Research. The experimental drug is studied in humans. The studies are known as clinical trials. Clinical trials are carefully designed and controlled experiments in which the experimental drug is administered to patients to test its safety and to determine the effectiveness of an experimental drug. The four general phases of clinical research are described below.

● | Phase 1 Clinical Studies. Phase 1 clinical studies are generally conducted with healthy volunteers who are not taking other medicines; patients with the illness that the drug is intended to treat are not tested at this stage. Ultimately, Phase 1 studies demonstrate how an experimental drug affects the body of a healthy individual. Phase 1 consists of a series of small studies consisting of tens of volunteers. Tests are done on each volunteer throughout the study to see how the person’s body processes, responds to, and is affected by the drug. Low doses and high doses of the drug are usually studied, resulting in the determination of the safe dosage range in volunteers by the end of Phase 1. This information will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase 2.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   23

  


● | Phase 2 Clinical Studies. Phase 2 clinical studies are conducted in order to determine how an experimental drug affects people who have the disease to be treated. Phase 2 usually consists of a limited number of studies that help determine the drug’s short-term safety, side effects, and general effectiveness. The studies in Phase 2 often are controlled investigations involving comparison between the experimental drug and a placebo, or between the experimental drug and an existing drug. Information gathered in Phase 2 studies will determine whether the drug proceeds to Phase 3.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 Clinical Studies. Phase 3 clinical studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled trials that are used to more fully investigate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. These trials differ from Phase 2 trials because a larger number of patients are studied (sometimes in the thousands) and because the studies are usually double blinded, placebo controlled and of longer duration. As well, Phase 3 studies can include patients who have more than one illness and are taking medications in addition to the experimental drug used in the study. Therefore, the patients in Phase 3 studies more closely reflect the general population. The information from Phase 3 forms the basis for most of the drug’s initial labeling, which will guide physicians on how to use the drug.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4 Clinical Studies. Phase 4 clinical studies are conducted after a drug is approved. Phase 4 studies may be required by the FDA or conducted by companies to more fully understand how their drug compares to other drugs. FDA-required Phase 4 studies often investigate the drug in specific types of patients that may not have been included in the Phase 3 studies and can involve very large numbers of patients to further assess the drug’s safety.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Stage 3: FDA Review for Approval. Following the completion of Phase 3 clinical studies, the pharmaceutical company prepares an electronic common technical document reporting all clinical nonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control studies conducted on the drug that is transmitted to the FDA as a New Drug Application (NDA). The FDA reviews the information in the NDA to determine if the drug is safe and effective for its intended use. An advisory panel meeting is scheduled for a new drug allowing the FDA to gain feedback from experts. If the FDA determines that the drug is safe and effective, the drug will be approved.
 
Stage 4: Marketing. After the FDA has approved the experimental drug, the pharmaceutical company can make it available to physicians and their patients. A company also may continue to conduct research to discover new uses for the drug. Each time a new use for a drug is discovered, the drug once again is subject to the entire FDA approval process before it can be marketed for that purpose.
 
Any FDA approved pharmaceutical products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA guidance documents, and promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet or social media. Failure to comply with FDA requirements is likely to have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, warning or enforcement letters from the FDA or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, product seizures or recalls and state or federal civil or criminal prosecution, injunctions and penalties.
 
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
 
   24

  

DM199 may qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product (BLA) cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA.
 
European Approval Process
 
The EMA is roughly parallel to the FDA in terms of the drug approval process and the strict requirements for approval. The EMA was set up in 1995 in an attempt to harmonize, but not replace, the work of existing national medicine regulatory bodies in individual European countries. As with the FDA, the EMA drug review and approval process follows similar stages from preclinical testing through clinical testing in Phase 1, 2, and 3. There are some differences between the FDA and EMA review process, specifically the review process in individual European countries. Such differences may allow certain drug products to be tested in patients at an earlier stage of development.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the U.S. government, including, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, a company, including its sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act as it relates to advertising and promotion of drugs, the federal False Claims Act, as amended, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and similar state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA), and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products being lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.
 
   25

  

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy; and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists regarding the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
 
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers’ drug formularies or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product candidate to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
 
Research and Development
 
We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development (R&D) which therefore comprises the largest component of our operating costs. Our primary focus over the past approximately 10 years has been our lead product candidate, DM199, which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of AIS and CKD.
 
We expect our R&D expenses will continue to increase in the future as we continue the development and clinical study of our initial product candidate, DM199, in AIS and CKD and seek to expand our product candidate portfolio. The process of conducting the necessary development and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming and we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be integral to our long-term success. The actual probability of success for each product candidate, clinical indication and preclinical program may be affected by a variety of factors including, among other things, the safety and efficacy data for each product candidate, amounts invested in their respective programs, competition and competitive developments, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.
 
   26

  

R&D expenses include:
 

● | expenses incurred under contract research agreements and other agreements with third parties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expenses incurred under agreements with clinical trial sites that conduct research and development activities on our behalf;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | laboratory and vendor expenses related to the execution of clinical trials and non-clinical studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the cost of acquiring, developing, manufacturing, and distributing clinical trial materials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | employee and consultant-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, travel and share-based compensation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facilities and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supply costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities such as clinical trials are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites.
 
Provided that the FDA lifts the clinical hold on the IND for our ReMEDy2 clinical trial, we expect that it will be at least three to four years, if ever, before we have any product candidates ready for commercialization.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of DM199 nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (Catalent), a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) with proven GMP experience in the manufacturing of recombinant proteins for clinical trials, for all of our required raw materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients for our clinical trials. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing relationship with Catalent.
Sales and Marketing
 
We have not yet defined our sales, marketing or product distribution strategy for our initial product candidate, DM199, or any future product candidates. We currently expect to partner with a large pharmaceutical company for sales execution. However, our future commercial strategy may include the use of distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States.
Intellectual Property
 
We view patents and other means of intellectual property protection, including trade secrets, as an important component of our core business. We focus on translating our innovations into intellectual property protecting our proprietary technology from infringement by competitors. To that end, patents are reviewed frequently and continue to be sought in relation to those components or concepts of our preclinical and clinical products to provide protection. Our strategy, where possible, is to file patent applications to protect our product candidates, as well as methods of manufacturing, administering and using a product candidate. Prior art searches of both patent and scientific databases are performed to evaluate novelty, inventiveness and freedom-to-operate. We require all employees, consultants and parties to a collaborative research agreement to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting relationships or a collaboration with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the engagement with us is to be kept confidential. We also maintain agreements with our scientific staff and all parties contracted in a scientific capacity affirming that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, using our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period covered by the agreement are the exclusive property of DiaMedica.
 
   27

  

Our DM199 patent portfolio includes three granted U.S. patents, a granted European patent, a granted Canadian patent, and pending applications in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and the United States. Granted or pending claims offer various forms of protection for DM199 including claims to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, specific formulations and dosing levels and methods for treating a variety of diseases, including stroke, chronic kidney disease and related disorders. These U.S. patents and applications, and their foreign equivalents, are described in more detail below.
 
Issued patents held by us cover the DM199 composition of matter based on an optimized combination of closely-related isoforms that differ in the extent of glycosylation (process by which sugars are chemically attached to proteins). Issued claims in this patent family cover the most pharmacologically active variants of DM199 and methods of using the same for treating ischemic conditions and these patents are due to expire in 2033. A second patent family includes an issued U.S. patent with claims directed to methods of treating subjects by administering a SC formulation of DM199 or related recombinant kallikrein-1 (KLK1) polypeptides and is predicted to expire in 2033. The pending applications are directed to a range of dose levels and dosing regimens of DM199 that are potentially useful for treating a wide range of diseases including, e.g. pulmonary arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, stroke and vascular dementia which, if granted, are predicted to expire in 2038.
 
As previously discussed, we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of DM199. We are contracting with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. We have licensed certain gene expression technology and we contract with Catalent for the manufacture of DM199. Under the terms of this license, certain milestone and royalty payments may become due and are dependent upon, among other factors, performing clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and ultimately the successful commercialization of a new drug, the outcome and timing of which is uncertain. The royalty term is indefinite but the license agreement may be canceled by us on 90 days’ prior written notice. The license may not be terminated by Catalent unless we fail to make required milestone and royalty payments.
 
Methods and reagents required for commercial scale manufacture of DM199 are subject to a series of patents issued to Catalent. We license these patents from Catalent, and such license is exclusive as it relates to the production of DM199 or any human KLK1 protein.
 
We believe that our proprietary technology along with trade secrets and specialized knowledge of the manufacturing process will provide substantial protection from third-party competitors. We also believe that DM199 cannot be easily reverse engineered for the production of a copycat version.
 
   28

  

We believe that the most relevant granted patents and applications with composition of matter or method of use claims covering DM199 are listed below, along with their projected expiration dates exclusive of any patent term extension:

US 16/492,059 | Dosage Forms of Tissue Kallikrein 1 | US | 2038 

 
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 
The term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
 
   29

  

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 16 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage and none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are currently an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act) and anticipate remaining an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first sale of common shares pursuant to a registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As an emerging growth company, although we elected not to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, we are permitted and intend to continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, in this report, we have provided only two years of audited financial statements and have not included certain other information that will be required once we are no longer an emerging growth company, although if we remain a smaller reporting company under the U.S. federal securities laws, we will still be permitted to provided scaled disclosure in certain instances. Accordingly, the information contained in this report may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests or information that we may be required to provide in the future.
