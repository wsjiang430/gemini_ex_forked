Item 1.    Business.
Overview
We are the world’s largest private-sector coal company by volume. As of December 31, 2018, we own interests in 23 coal mining operations located in the United States (U.S.) and Australia. We have a majority interest in 22 of those mining operations and a 50% equity interest in Middlemount Coal Pty Ltd. (Middlemount), which owns the Middlemount Mine in Queensland, Australia. In addition to our mining operations, we market and broker coal from other coal producers, both as principal and agent, and trade coal and freight-related contracts through trading and business offices in the U.S., Australia, China, and the United Kingdom. In 2018, we achieved a global safety incidence rate of 1.45 incidents per 200,000 hours worked, which was 54% better than the 2017 industry average incidence rate of 3.18 incidents per 200,000 hours worked per the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). We were also recognized by the U.S. National Mining Association as the first in the industry to achieve independent certification under the CORESafety® system.
On December 3, 2018, we acquired the Shoal Creek metallurgical coal mine, preparation plant and supporting assets located in Alabama (Shoal Creek Mine) as further discussed in Note 3. “Acquisition of Shoal Creek Mine” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our results of operations include the Shoal Creek Mine’s results of operations from December 4, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The Shoal Creek Mine’s results are reflected in our Seaborne Metallurgical Mining segment.
Our current focus is on enhancing shareholder value through successfully integrating the Shoal Creek Mine, accelerating a safe return to operations at our North Goonyella Mine as further discussed in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 22. “Other Events” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, advancing attractive mine life extension projects in seaborne segments, continuing to emphasize value over volume, particularly in the U.S. thermal operations, and maintaining our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. 
Segment and Geographic Information
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we purchased the Shoal Creek Mine. Due to the acquisition, we updated our reportable segments to reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker (CODM) views our businesses for purposes of reviewing performance, allocating resources and assessing future prospects and strategic execution. We now report our results of operations primarily through the following reportable segments: Powder River Basin Mining, Midwestern U.S. Mining, Western U.S. Mining, Seaborne Metallurgical Mining, Seaborne Thermal Mining and Corporate and Other. 
Refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding our segments. Segment and geographic financial information is also contained in Note 28. “Segment and Geographic Information” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.

Coal Supply Agreements
Customers. Our coal supply agreements are primarily with electricity generators, industrial facilities and steel manufacturers. Most of our sales from our mining operations are made under long-term coal supply agreements (those with initial terms of one year or longer and which often include price reopener and/or extension provisions). A smaller portion of our sales from our mining operations are made under contracts with terms of less than one year, including sales made on a spot basis. Sales under long-term coal supply agreements comprised approximately 87%, 83% and 86% of our worldwide sales from our mining operations (by volume) for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A recent trend has been for our customers under long-term coal supply agreements to seek contracts of shorter duration.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 25% of our revenues from coal supply agreements from our five largest customers. Those five customers were supplied primarily from 48 coal supply agreements (excluding trading and brokerage transactions) expiring at various times from 2019 to 2025. The contract contributing the greatest amount of annual revenue in 2018 was approximately $327 million, or approximately 6% of our 2018 total revenues from coal supply agreements, and is due to expire in 2019. 
Backlog. Our sales backlog, which includes coal supply agreements subject to price reopener and/or extension provisions, was approximately 401 million and 476 million tons of coal as of January 1, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contracts in backlog have remaining terms ranging from one to nine years and represent approximately two years of production based on our 2018 production volume of 182.1 million tons. Approximately 63% of our backlog is expected to be filled beyond 2019. 
U.S. Thermal Mining Operations. Revenues from our Powder River Basin Mining, Western U.S. Mining and Midwestern U.S. Mining segments, in aggregate, represented approximately 52%, 53% and 59% of our revenues from coal supply agreements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective aggregate amounts of approximately 84%, 84% and 81% of our sales volumes from mining operations. We expect to continue selling a significant portion of our Powder River Basin Mining, Western U.S. Mining and Midwestern U.S. Mining segment coal production under long-term supply agreements, and customers of those segments continue to pursue long-term sales agreements in recognition of the importance of reliability, service and predictable coal prices to their operations. The terms of coal supply agreements result from competitive bidding and extensive negotiations with customers. Consequently, the terms of those agreements may vary in many respects, including price adjustment features, price reopener terms, coal quality requirements, quantity parameters, permitted sources of supply, treatment of environmental constraints, extension options, force majeure and termination and assignment provisions. Our approach is to selectively renew, or enter into new, long-term supply agreements when we can do so at prices and terms and conditions we believe are favorable.
Seaborne Mining Operations. Revenues from our Seaborne Metallurgical Mining and Seaborne Thermal Mining segments represented approximately 48%, 46% and 41% of our total revenues from coal supply agreements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, during which periods the coal mining activities of those segments contributed respective amounts of 16%, 16% and 19% of our sales volumes from mining operations. Our production is primarily sold into the seaborne metallurgical and thermal markets, with a majority of those sales executed through annual and multi-year international coal supply agreements that contain provisions requiring both parties to renegotiate pricing periodically. Industry commercial practice, and our typical practice, is to negotiate pricing for seaborne metallurgical coal contracts on a quarterly, spot or index basis and seaborne thermal coal contracts on an annual, spot or index basis. The portion of sales volume under contracts with a duration of less than one year represented 27% in 2018.
Transportation
Methods of Distribution. Coal consumed in the U.S. is usually sold at the mine with transportation costs borne by the purchaser. Our U.S. mine sites are typically adjacent to a rail loop; however, in limited circumstances coal may be trucked to a barge site or directly to customers. Title predominately passes to the purchaser at the rail or barge, as applicable. Our U.S. and Australian export coal is usually sold at the loading port, with purchasers paying ocean freight. In each case, we usually pay shipping costs from the mine to the port, including any demurrage costs (fees paid to third-party shipping companies for loading time that exceeded the stipulated time). 
We believe we have good relationships with U.S. and Australian rail carriers and port and barge companies due, in part, to our modern coal-loading facilities and the experience of our transportation coordinators. Refer to the table in the foregoing “Mining Locations” section for a summary of transportation methods by mine.
Export Facilities. Our U.S. thermal mining operations exported approximately 1%, 1% and 0% of its annual tons sold for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The primary ports used for U.S. thermal exports are the United Bulk Terminal near New Orleans, Louisiana, the St. James Stevedoring Anchorages terminal in Convent, Louisiana and the Kinder Morgan terminal near Houston, Texas. We periodically assess opportunities for access to West Coast port facilities that will allow us to export our Powder River Basin coal products to serve demand in the Asian region, should market conditions warrant. 

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 6

Our seaborne mining operations, which include our Shoal Creek Mine, sold approximately 75%, 73% and 75% of its tons into the seaborne coal markets for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We have generally secured our ability to transport coal in Australia through rail and port contracts and interests in five east coast coal export terminals that are primarily funded through take-or-pay arrangements (refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information on our take-or-pay obligations). In Queensland, seaborne metallurgical and thermal coal from our mines is exported through the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, in addition to the Abbot Point Coal Terminal used by our joint venture Middlemount Mine. In New South Wales, our primary ports for exporting metallurgical and thermal coal are at Port Kembla and Newcastle, which includes both the Port Waratah Coal Services terminal and the terminal operated by Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group. We have secured our ability to transport coal from our Shoal Creek Mine under barge and port contracts; the primary port is the McDuffie Terminal in Mobile, Alabama, which we utilize without a take-or-pay arrangement.
Suppliers
Mining Supplies and Equipment. The principal goods we purchase in support of our mining activities are mining equipment and replacement parts, diesel fuel, ammonium-nitrate and emulsion-based explosives, off-the-road tires, steel-related products (including roof control materials), lubricants and electricity. We have many well-established, strategic relationships with our key suppliers of goods and do not believe that we are overly dependent on any of our individual suppliers.
In situations where we have elected to concentrate a large portion of our purchases with one supplier in lieu of seeking other alternatives, it has been to take advantage of cost savings from larger volumes of purchases, benefit from long-term pricing for parts, ensure security of supply and/or allow for equipment fleet standardization. Supplier concentration related to our mining equipment also allows us to benefit from fleet standardization, which in turn improves asset utilization by facilitating the development of common maintenance practices across our global platform and enhancing our flexibility to move equipment between mines as necessary. 
Surface and underground mining equipment demand and lead times have begun to extend in recent periods due to recovering market conditions experienced across several extractive industry sectors. We do not expect this to impact our own near-term demand for such equipment as we extend the lives of existing equipment through improved maintenance practices and equipment rebuilds in order to defer the requirement for larger capital purchases. We continue to use our global leverage with major suppliers to ensure security of supply to meet the requirements of our active mines. 
Services. We also purchase services at our mine sites, including services related to maintenance for mining equipment, construction, temporary labor, use of explosives and various other requirements. We do not believe that we have undue operational or financial risk associated with our dependence on any individual service providers.
Competition
Demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are highly competitive and influenced by factors beyond our control, including but not limited to global economic conditions; the demand for electricity and steel; the cost of alternative fuels; the cost of electricity generation from alternative fuels, including wind, solar, oil, hydro, nuclear, natural gas and biomass; the impact of weather on heating and cooling demand and taxes and environmental regulations imposed by the U.S. and foreign governments.
Thermal Coal
Demand for our thermal coal products is impacted by economic conditions, demand for electricity, including the impact of energy efficient products, and the cost of electricity generation from coal and alternative fuels. Our products compete with producers of other forms of electric generation, including natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass, that provide an alternative to coal use. The use and price of thermal coal is heavily influenced by the availability and relative cost of alternative fuels and the generation of electricity utilizing alternative fuels, with customers focused on securing the lowest cost fuel supply in order to coordinate the most efficient utilization of generating resources in the economic dispatch of the power grid at the most competitive price.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 7

In the U.S., natural gas is highly competitive (along with other alternative fuel sources) with thermal coal for electricity generation. The competitiveness of natural gas has been strengthened by accelerated growth in domestic natural gas production and transmission facilities over the last five years and comparatively low natural gas prices (versus historic levels). The Henry Hub Natural Gas Prompt Price averaged $3.07 per mmBtu in 2018, versus $3.02, $2.55 and $2.63 per mmBtu in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Natural gas price trends can significantly impact U.S. coal burn and production. We believe the U.S. Powder River and Illinois basins in which we produce are competitive against natural gas when the prices exceed $2.50 to $2.75 per mmBtu and $3.00 to $3.50 per mmBtu, respectively. In addition, the competitiveness of other alternative fuel sources for electricity generation with coal has been strengthened by the growth of low-cost and government subsidized generation fueled by other alternative fuel sources. These pressures, coupled with increasing regulatory burdens, have contributed to a significant number of coal plant retirements. During 2018, approximately 17 gigawatts of U.S. coal power capacity was retired, and since 2010, U.S. coal power capacity has fallen by nearly a quarter. 
Internationally, thermal coal also competes with alternative forms of electric generation. The competitiveness and availability of natural gas, oil, nuclear, hydro, wind, solar and biomass varies by country and region. Seaborne thermal coal consumption is also impacted by the competitiveness of delivered seaborne thermal coal supply from key exporting countries such Indonesia, Australia, Russia, Colombia, the U.S. and South Africa, among others. In addition, seaborne thermal coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in the two leading coal import countries, China and India, among others. 
In addition to our alternative fuel source competitors, our principal U.S. direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) are other large coal producers, including Alliance Resource Partners, Arch Coal, Blackjewel, Cloud Peak Energy, CONSOL Energy, and Murray Energy Corporation, among others. Major international direct coal supply competitors (listed alphabetically) include Anglo American plc, BHP Billiton, China Shenhua Energy, Coal India Limited, Drummond Company, Glencore plc, PT Adaro Energy Tbk, SUEK and Whitehaven Coal Limited, among others.
Metallurgical Coal 
Demand for our metallurgical coal products is impacted by economic conditions, demand for steel and competing technologies used to make steel, some of which do not use coal as a manufacturing input. We compete on the basis of coal quality and characteristics, delivered energy cost (including transportation costs), customer service and support and reliability of supply.
Seaborne metallurgical coal import demand can be significantly impacted by the availability of indigenous coal production, particularly in leading metallurgical coal import countries of China, India, Japan, South Korea and Brazil, among others, and the competitiveness of seaborne metallurgical coal supply, including from leading metallurgical coal exporting countries of Australia, U.S., Russia, Canada, Mongolia and Mozambique, among others.
Major international direct competitors (listed alphabetically) include Anglo American plc, BHP Billiton, China Coal, China Shenhua Energy, Teck Resources, Rio Tinto and Whitehaven, among others.
Cybersecurity Risk Management
We use digital technology to conduct our business operations and engage with our customers, vendors and partners. As we implement newer technologies such as cloud, analytics, automation and “internet of things”, the threats to our business operations from cyber intrusions, denial of service attacks, manipulation and other cyber misconduct increase. To address the risk, we continue to evolve our risk management approach in an effort to continually assesses and improve our cybersecurity risk detection, deterrence and recovery capabilities. Our cybersecurity strategy emphasizes reduction of cyber risk exposure and continuous improvement of our cyber defense and resilience capabilities. These include: (i) proactive management of cyber risk to ensure compliance with contractual, legal and regulatory requirements, (ii) performing due diligence on third parties to ensure they have sound cybersecurity practices in place, (iii) ensuring essential business services remain available during a business disruption, (iv) implementing data policies and standards to protect sensitive company information and (v) exercising cyber incident response plans and risk mitigation strategies to address potential incidents should they occur. For more information regarding the risks associated with these matters, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 
Working Capital
We generally fund our working capital requirements through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from the sale of our coal production to customers. Our current accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facility are also available to fund our working capital requirements to the extent we have remaining availability. Refer to the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding working capital.

Filing Under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
On April 13, 2016 (the Petition Date), Peabody and a majority of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries as well as one international subsidiary in Gibraltar (collectively with Peabody, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the Bankruptcy Petitions) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the Bankruptcy Court). The Debtors’ Chapter 11 cases (collectively, the Chapter 11 Cases) were jointly administered under the caption In re Peabody Energy Corporation, et al., Case No. 16-42529 (Bankr. E.D. Mo.). 
On March 17, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 2763 (the Confirmation Order), confirming the Debtors’ Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession (as further modified, the Plan). On April 3, 2017 (the Effective Date), the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness set forth in the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 10

A group of creditors (the Ad Hoc Committee) that held certain interests in the Company’s prepetition indebtedness appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order confirming the Plan. On December 29, 2017, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri (the District Court) entered an order dismissing the Ad Hoc Committee’s appeal, and, in the alternative, affirming the order confirming the Plan. On January 26, 2018, the Ad Hoc Committee appealed the District Court’s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (the Eighth Circuit). In its appeal, the Ad Hoc Committee does not ask the Eighth Circuit to reverse the order confirming the Plan. Instead, the Ad Hoc Committee asks the Eighth Circuit to award the Ad Hoc Committee members either unspecified damages or the right to buy an unspecified amount of Company stock at a discount. The Company does not believe the appeal is meritorious and will vigorously defend it.
Upon emergence, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 852, we applied fresh start reporting to our consolidated financial statements as of April 1, 2017 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes reflecting the Successor (as defined below) capital structure. As a new entity, a new accounting basis in the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed was established with no retained earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For additional details, refer to Note 1. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 2. “Emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases and Fresh Start Reporting” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Regulatory Matters — U.S.
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, water pollution, plant and wildlife protection, the reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining has been completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the industry is affected by significant requirements mandating certain benefits for current and retired coal miners. Numerous federal, state and local governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. We believe that we have obtained all permits currently required to conduct our present mining operations.
We endeavor to conduct our mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time in the industry. 
Mine Safety and Health 
We are subject to health and safety standards both at the federal and state level. The regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations and other matters.
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is the entity responsible for monitoring compliance with the federal mine health and safety standards. MSHA employs various enforcement measures for noncompliance, including the issuance of monetary penalties and orders of withdrawal from a mine or part of a mine.
In Part I, Item 4. “Mine Safety Disclosures” and in Exhibit 95 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provide additional details on MSHA compliance, through the mine safety disclosures required by SEC regulations.
Black Lung (Coal Workers’ Pneumoconiosis)
Under the U.S. Black Lung Benefits Revenue Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981, each U.S. coal mine operator who was the last to employ a claimant for a cumulative year of employment, with the last day worked for the operator after July 1, 1973, must pay federal black lung benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose claims for benefits are allowed. Coal mine operators must also make payments to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants who last worked in the coal industry prior to July 1, 1973. Historically, very few of the miners who sought federal black lung benefits were awarded these benefits; however, the approval rate has increased following implementation of black lung provisions contained in the Affordable Care Act. The trust fund was funded by an excise tax on U.S. production of up to $1.10 per ton for deep-mined coal and up to $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, neither amount to exceed 4.4% of the gross sales price. The tax reverted to its original level of $0.50 per ton of underground coal and $0.25 per ton of surface coal on January 1, 2019. We recognized expense related to the tax of $78.6 million, $60.9 million, $20.1 million and $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, the period April 2 through December 31, 2017, the period January 1 through April 1, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to various federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations place substantial requirements on our coal mining operations, and require regular inspection and monitoring of our mines and other facilities to ensure compliance. We are also affected by various other federal, state, local and tribal environmental laws and regulations that impact our customers.

Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. In the U.S., the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), which is administered by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), established mining, environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of U.S. surface mining and many aspects of underground mining. Mine operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals for mining operations from the OSMRE. Where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under SMCRA, the state becomes the primary regulatory authority, with oversight from OSMRE. Except for Arizona, states in which we have active mining operations have achieved primacy control of enforcement through federal authorization. In Arizona, we mine on tribal lands and are regulated by the OSMRE because the tribes do not have SMCRA authorization.
SMCRA provides for three categories of bonds: surety bonds, collateral bonds and self-bonds. A surety bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain payable to the regulatory authority, executed by the permittee as principal and which is supported by the performance guarantee of a surety corporation. A collateral bond can take several forms, including cash, letters of credit, first lien security interest in property or other qualifying investment securities. A self-bond is an indemnity agreement in a sum certain executed by the permittee or by the permittee and any corporate guarantor made payable to the regulatory authority.
Our total reclamation bonding requirements in the U.S. were $1,238.9 million as of December 31, 2018. The bond requirements for a mine represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceased to operate in the current period. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state. Our asset retirement obligations calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for our U.S. operations were $503.3 million as of December 31, 2018. The bond requirement amount for our U.S. operations significantly exceeds the financial liability for final mine reclamation because the asset retirement obligation liability is discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition that the final reclamation cash outlay is a number of years (and in some cases decades) away. The bond amount, in contrast with the asset retirement obligation, presumes reclamation begins immediately.
After a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency, it goes through a completeness and technical review. Public notice of the proposed permit is given for a comment period before a permit can be issued. Regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public has the right to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including public hearings and through intervention in the courts. Before a SMCRA permit is issued, a mine operator must submit a bond or other form of financial security to guarantee the performance of reclamation bonding requirements.
In situations where our coal resources are federally owned, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management oversees a substantive exploration and leasing process. If surface land is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, that agency serves as the cooperating agency during the federal coal leasing process. Federal coal leases also require an approved federal mining permit under the signature of the Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior.
The SMCRA Abandoned Mine Land Fund requires a fee on all coal produced in the U.S. The proceeds are used to rehabilitate lands mined and left unreclaimed prior to August 3, 1977 and to pay health care benefit costs of orphan beneficiaries of the Combined Fund created by the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992. The fee amount can change periodically based on changes in federal legislation. Pursuant to the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, from October 1, 2012 through September 30, 2021, the fee is $0.28 and $0.12 per ton of surface-mined and underground-mined coal, respectively. We recognized expense related to the fees of $40.9 million, $31.6 million, $10.3 million and $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, the period April 2 through December 31, 2017, the period January 1 through April 1, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA, enacted in 1970, and comparable state and tribal laws that regulate air emissions affect our U.S. coal mining operations both directly and indirectly. 
Direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations may occur through the CAA permitting requirements and/or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide, ozone and sulfur dioxide (SO2). In recent years the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted more stringent national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM, nitrogen oxide, ozone and SO2. It is possible that these modifications as well as future modifications to NAAQS could directly or indirectly impact our mining operations in a manner that includes, but is not limited to, designating new nonattainment areas or expanding existing nonattainment areas, serving as a basis for changes in vehicle emission standards or prompting additional local control measures pursuant to state implementation plans required to address revised NAAQS.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 12

In 2009, the EPA adopted revised rules to add more stringent PM emissions limits for coal preparation and processing plants constructed or modified after April 28, 2008. The PM NAAQS was thereafter revised and made more stringent in 2012. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule setting the ozone NAAQS at 70 parts per billion (ppb). (80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, (Oct. 25, 2015)). This final rule has been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit), however, the case had been held in abeyance pending the EPA’s review of the final rule. In August 2018, the EPA said it would continue with the rule, meaning the lawsuit was revived and oral arguments were heard in the D.C. Circuit in December 2018. More stringent ozone standards would require new state implementation plans to be developed and filed with the EPA and may trigger additional control technology for mining equipment or result in additional challenges to permitting and expansion efforts. This could also be the case with respect to the implementation for other NAAQS for nitrogen oxide and SO2. 
The CAA also indirectly, but significantly affects the U.S. coal industry by extensively regulating the air emissions of SO2, nitrogen oxides, mercury, PM and other substances emitted by coal-fueled electricity generating plants, imposing more capital and operating costs on such facilities. In addition, other CAA programs may require further emission reductions to address the interstate transport of air pollution or regional haze. The air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the Acid Rain Program, interstate transport rules such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and the CSAPR Update Rule, New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) emissions limits for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the Regional Haze program and source permitting programs, including requirements related to New Source Review.
In addition, since 2011, the EPA has required underground coal mines to report on their greenhouse gas emissions. Regulations regarding reporting requirements for underground coal mines were updated in 2016 and now include the ability to cease reporting if mines are abandoned and sealed. At present, however, the EPA does not directly regulate such emissions.
Final New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electricity Utility Generating Units (EGUs). The EPA promulgated a final rule to limit carbon dioxide (CO2) from new, modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired EGUs under section 111(b) of the CAA on August 3, 2015, and published it in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015.
This rule requires that newly-constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units achieve an emission standard for carbon dioxide of 1,400 lb carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour gross output (CO2/MWh-gross). The standard is based on the performance of a supercritical pulverized coal boiler implementing partial carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). Modified and reconstructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units must implement the most efficient generation achievable through a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades, to meet an emission standard consistent with best historical performance. Reconstructed units must implement the most efficient generating technology based on the size of the unit (supercritical steam conditions for larger units, to meet a standard of 1,800 lb CO2/MWh-gross, and subcritical conditions for smaller units to meet a standard of 2,000 lb CO2/MWh-gross).
Numerous legal challenges to the final rule were filed in the D.C. Circuit. Sixteen separate petitions for review were filed, and the challengers include 25 states, utilities, mining companies (including Peabody), labor unions, trade organizations and other groups. The cases were consolidated under the case filed by North Dakota (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1381). Four additional cases were filed seeking review of the EPA’s denial of reconsideration petitions in a final action published in the May 6, 2016 Federal Register entitled “Reconsideration of Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Generating Units; Notice of final action denying petitions for reconsideration.” Pursuant to an order of the court, these cases remain in abeyance, subject to requirements for the EPA to file 90-day status reports. Thus, the NSPS remains in effect.
On December 6, 2018, the EPA proposed to revise the 2015 NSPS to modify the minimum requirements for newly constructed coal-fired units from partial carbon capture and storage to efficiency-based standards. The proposal now defines the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) as the most efficient demonstrated steam cycle in combination with the best operating practices. The EPA has noted that the primary reason for this proposed revision is the high costs and limited geographic availability of carbon capture and storage technology. The comment period on the proposed rule concluded on February 19, 2019.
Final Rule Regulating Carbon Dioxide Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired EGUs. On October 23, 2015, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register regulating CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs under section 111(d) of the CAA (80 Fed. Reg. 64,662 (Oct. 23, 2015)). The rule (known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP)) establishes emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired EGUs. These final guidelines require that the states individually or collectively create systems that would reduce carbon emissions from any EGU located within their borders by 28% in 2025 and 32% in 2030 (compared with a 2005 baseline).  

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 13

Following Federal Register publication, 39 separate petitions for review of the CPP by approximately 157 entities were filed in the D.C. Circuit. The petitions reflect challenges by 27 states and governmental entities, as well as challenges by utilities, industry groups, trade associations, coal companies, and other entities. The lawsuits were consolidated with the case filed by West Virginia and Texas (in which other states have also joined). (D.C. Cir. No. 15-1363). On October 29, 2015, we filed a motion to intervene in the case filed by West Virginia and Texas, in support of the petitioning states. The motion was granted on January 11, 2016. Numerous states and cities have also been allowed to intervene in support of the EPA.
On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court granted a motion to stay implementation of the CPP until its legal challenges are resolved. Thereafter, oral arguments in the case were heard in the D.C. Circuit sitting en banc by ten active D.C. Circuit judges, but to date, the D.C. Circuit has not issued an opinion. On April 28, 2017, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion by the EPA to hold the case in abeyance for 60 days while the agency reconsidered the rule. The D.C. Circuit renewed the abeyance several times, but the most recent abeyance expired on August 27, 2018. The D.C. Circuit is considering filings by the EPA and the petitioners that ask it to issue an additional abeyance over the opposition of some states and their supporters that asked the court to issue a decision on the merits.
In October 2017, the EPA proposed to change its legal interpretation of CAA section 111(d), the authority that the agency relied on for the 2015 CPP. (82 Fed. Reg. 48,035 (Oct. 16, 2017)). If this proposed reinterpretation is finalized by the EPA, the CPP would be repealed.
The EPA relied on the proposed reinterpretation until August 2018, when it proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule, which proposes to replace the CPP with a system where states will develop emissions reduction plans using BSER measures, which are essentially efficiency heat rate improvements, and the EPA will approve the state plans if they use EPA-approved candidate technologies. Changes in the New Source Review (NSR) program are also proposed to allow efficiency improvements to be made without triggering NSR requirements. If adopted, ACE will provide states with the flexibility to regulate on a plant-by-plant basis with a focus on coal-fired EGUs. Public comments on the rule were due October 31, 2018, and the EPA is expected to finalize the rule in March 2019. Litigation may be initiated, however, and the final timeline may shift.
EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Permitting Regulations for Major Emission Sources. In May 2010, the EPA published final rules requiring permitting and control technology requirements for greenhouse gases under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V permitting programs that apply to stationary sources of air pollution. The EPA determined that these requirements were “triggered” by the EPA’s prior regulation of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles.These rules were subsequently upheld by the D.C. Circuit on June 26, 2012. On June 23, 2014, however, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA could not require PSD and Title V permitting for greenhouse gases emitted from stationary sources if those sources were not otherwise considered to be “major sources” of conventional pollutants for purposes of PSD and Title V (known as Step 2 sources). In accordance with that decision, the D.C. Circuit vacated the federal regulations that implemented Step 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule in 2015. Subsequently, the EPA removed the vacated elements from its rules to ensure that neither the PSD nor Title V rules require a source to obtain a permit solely because the source emits or has the potential to emit greenhouse gases above the applicable thresholds. The EPA therefore no longer has the authority to conduct PSD permitting for Step 2 sources, nor can the EPA approve provisions submitted by a state for inclusion in its SIP providing this authority.
Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and CSAPR Update Rule. On July 6, 2011, the EPA finalized the CSAPR, which requires the District of Columbia and 27 states from Texas eastward (not including the New England states or Delaware) to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and significantly contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Following litigation in the D.C. Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and SO2 emissions reductions required by CSAPR commenced in January 2015; further reductions of both pollutants in the second phase of CSAPR became effective in January 2017. The EPA subsequently revised CSAPR requirements for the state of Texas to remove that state from second phase requirements regarding SO2 (82 Fed. Reg. 45,481 (Sept. 29, 2017)).
On October 26, 2016, the EPA promulgated the CSAPR Update Rule to address implementation of the 2008 ozone national air quality standards. This rule imposed further reductions in nitrogen oxides in 2017 in 22 states subject to CSAPR. Several states and utilities as well as agricultural and industry groups utilities have filed petitions for review of the CSAPR Update Rule in the D.C. Circuit. Other states and interest groups have filed to intervene on behalf of the EPA. These petitions have been consolidated under D.C. Cir. No. 16-1406. Oral argument was held in October 2018 and a decision is pending.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 14

In the meantime, on December 6, 2018, the EPA issued a final determination that the existing CSAPR Update fully addresses the CAA’s “good neighbor” requirements for 20 states with respect to the 2008 ground-level ozone standard. The final rule determines that 2023 is an appropriate future analytic year to evaluate further good neighbor requirements. As a result, these 20 states are not expected to contribute significantly to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance of the NAAQS in any other state. With this determination, the EPA has no obligation to establish additional requirements for sources in theses states to further reduce transported ozone pollution under the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In addition, the covered states do not need to submit state implementation plans (SIPs) that would establish additional requirements beyond the existing CSAPR Update.
Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS). The EPA published the final MATS rule in the Federal Register on February 16, 2012. The MATS rule revised the NSPS for nitrogen oxides, SO2 and PM for new and modified coal-fueled electricity generating plants, and imposed MACT emission limits on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from new and existing coal-fueled and oil-fueled electric generating plants. MACT standards limit emissions of mercury, acid gas HAPs, non-mercury HAP metals and organic HAPs. The rule provided three years for compliance with MACT standards and a possible fourth year if a state permitting agency determined that such was necessary for the installation of controls.
Following issuance of the final rule, numerous petitions for review were filed. The D.C. Circuit upheld the NSPS portion of the rulemaking in a unanimous decision on March 11, 2014, and upheld the limits on HAPs against all challenges on April 15, 2014, in a two-to-one decision. Industry groups and a number of states filed and were granted review of the D.C. Circuit decision in the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA interpreted the CAA unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate HAPs from power plants. The court reversed the D.C. Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 1, 2015, in response to the court’s decision the EPA published a proposed supplemental finding in the Federal Register that consideration of costs does not alter the EPA’s previous determination regarding the control of HAPs in the MATS rule. On December 15, 2015, the D.C. Circuit issued an order providing that the rule will remain in effect while the EPA responds to the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
On April 14, 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding that largely tracked its proposed finding. Several states, companies and industry groups challenged that supplemental finding in the D.C. Circuit in separate petitions for review, which were subsequently consolidated. (D.C. Cir. No. 116-1127). Several states and environmental groups also filed as intervenors for the respondent EPA. Although briefing in this litigation has concluded, the case remains in abeyance.
On December 27, 2018, the EPA issued a proposed revised Supplemental Cost Finding for the MATS rule that would revoke the determination that regulating HAPs from coal-fired power plants is “appropriate and necessary” under Section 112(n)(1)(A) of the CAA. The finding was based on an EPA assessment that health and environmental benefits from the MATS rule that are not directly related to mercury pollution should not be included in the benefit portion of the analysis. In the new proposed cost-benefit analysis, the EPA found the costs “grossly outweigh” any possible benefits.
Federal Coal Leasing Moratorium. President Trump’s Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth (EI Order) signed on March 28, 2017, lifted the Department of Interior’s federal coal leasing moratorium and rescinded guidance on the inclusion of social cost of carbon in federal rulemaking. Following the EI Order, the Interior Secretary issued Order 3349 ending the federal coal leasing moratorium. Environmental groups took the issue to court and in September 2018, Wyoming and Montana opposed the suits in court and defended against the freeze possibly being reinstated. This litigation is ongoing.
Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA of 1972 directly impacts U.S. coal mining operations by requiring effluent limitations and treatment standards for wastewater discharge from mines through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Regular monitoring, reporting and performance standards are requirements of NPDES permits that govern the discharge of water from mine-related point sources into receiving waters. 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates certain activities affecting navigable waters and waters of the U.S., including wetlands. Section 404 of the CWA requires mining companies to obtain Corps permits to place material in streams for the purpose of creating slurry ponds, water impoundments, refuse areas, valley fills or other mining activities.
States are empowered to develop and apply “in stream” water quality standards. These standards are subject to change and must be approved by the EPA. Discharges must either meet state water quality standards or be authorized through available regulatory processes such as alternate standards or variances. “In stream” standards vary from state to state. Additionally, through the CWA section 401 certification program, states have approval authority over federal permits or licenses that might result in a discharge to their waters. States consider whether the activity will comply with their water quality standards and other applicable requirements in deciding whether or not to certify the activity.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 15

A final rule defining the scope of waters protected under the CWA (commonly called the Waters of the United States (WOTUS Rule)), was published by the EPA and the Corps in June 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the 2015 Rule nationwide on October 9, 2015, and that stay remained in place until early 2018. Before the Sixth Circuit lifted its stay, the EPA and the Corps finalized a rule, also known as the “Delay Rule,” on February 6, 2018 that amended the 2015 WOTUS Rule by specifying that the Rule does not apply until February 6, 2020. Consequently, the pre-2015 definitions of WOTUS remained in effect nationwide. However, in August 2018, the U.S. District Court in South Carolina overturned the “Delay Rule” saying the administration had failed to offer the public a proper opportunity to comment. That put the 2015 rule into effect in 26 states, but not in the other 24 states where federal court injunctions are still in place. In September 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas granted an injunction request for three more states; Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Also that month, industry filed a motion in a Georgia district court to expand its previous injunction, which stopped implementation in 11 states, to apply nationwide. Other district courts may also consider the issue in the coming months. The EPA and the Corps are still in the process of repealing the 2015 WOTUS Rule and developing a replacement rule. The agencies proposed to repeal the 2015 Rule in July 2017, but they have not yet finalized a repeal action, and the final rule was expected before the end of 2018, but is now expected in 2019. Further, the EPA and the Corps issued a proposed rule in December 2018 offering a replacement definition of WOTUS. The proposal would remove federal protections for streams that flow only after rain or snowfall, as well as wetlands that do not have surface water connections to larger waterways. The public comment period on the proposed rule ends on February 27, 2019. Depending on the outcome of litigation and/or rulemaking activity, the scope of CWA authority could increase, decrease, or stay the same relative to the current, pre-2015 definitions of WOTUS, which could impact our operations in some areas.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA, signed into law in 1970, requires federal agencies to review the environmental impacts of their decisions and issue either an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. We must provide information to agencies when we propose actions that will be under the authority of the federal government. The NEPA process involves public participation and can involve lengthy timeframes. The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2018 seeking comment on a number of ways to streamline and improve the NEPA process. The comment period closed in August 2018. It is unclear how far reaching the changes will be and if they will be able to withstand expected court challenges. 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA, which was enacted in 1976, affects U.S. coal mining operations by establishing “cradle to grave” requirements for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. Typically, the only hazardous wastes generated at a mine site are those from products used in vehicles and for machinery maintenance. Coal mine wastes, such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes, are not considered hazardous wastes under RCRA.
Subtitle C of RCRA exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the EPA completed a report to Congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous. On December 19, 2014, the EPA announced the final rule on coal combustion residuals (CCR or coal ash). As finalized, the rule continues the exemption of CCR from regulation as a hazardous waste, but does impose new requirements at existing CCR surface impoundments and landfills that will need to be implemented over a number of different time-frames in the coming months and years, as well as at new surface impoundments and landfills. Generally these requirements will increase the cost of CCR management, but not as much as if the rule had regulated CCR as hazardous. This EPA initiative is separate from the OSMRE CCR rulemaking mentioned above.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Although generally not a prominent environmental law in the coal mining sector, CERCLA, which was enacted in 1980, nonetheless may affect U.S. coal mining operations by creating liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Under CERCLA, joint and several liabilities may be imposed on waste generators, site owners or operators and others, regardless of fault.
Toxic Release Inventory. Arising out of the passage of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act in 1986 and the Pollution Prevention Act passed in 1990, the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory program requires companies to report the use, manufacture or processing of listed toxic materials that exceed established thresholds, including chemicals used in equipment maintenance, reclamation, water treatment and ash received for mine placement from power generation customers.
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA of 1973 and counterpart state legislation is intended to protect species whose populations allow for categorization as either endangered or threatened. Changes in listings or requirements under these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our costs or our ability to mine some of our properties in accordance with our current mining plans. The Department of the Interior issued three proposed rules in August 2018 aiming to streamline and update the ESA.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 16

Use of Explosives. Our surface mining operations are subject to numerous regulations relating to blasting activities. Pursuant to these regulations, we incur costs to design and implement blast schedules and to conduct pre-blast surveys and blast monitoring. The storage of explosives is subject to strict federal regulatory requirements. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) regulates the use of explosive blasting materials. In addition to ATF regulation, the Department of Homeland Security is expected to finalize an ammonium nitrate security program rule. The OSMRE has also initiated a rulemaking addressing nitrous clouds that may be produced during blasting. While such new regulations may result in additional costs related to our surface mining operations, such costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule. On October 10, 2017, the Secretary of Energy (the Secretary) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled the Grid Resiliency Pricing Rule (the Proposed Rule). The Proposed Rule was issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act. (42 U.S.C. § 7173). In the Proposed Rule, the Secretary instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose rules to ensure that reliability and resiliency attributes of certain electric generation units with a 90-day on-site fuel supply are fully compensated for the benefits and services they provide to grid operations. The Secretary directed FERC to take final action on the Proposed Rule within 60 days of publication or, in the alternative, to issue the rule as an interim final rule immediately, with provision for later modifications after consideration of public comments. The Proposed Rule cites the retirements of coal and nuclear plants as a potential threat to grid reliability and resilience, and provides for the creation of a “reliability and resiliency rate” that would compensate certain eligible resources for the benefits and services they provide to grid operations, allowing such eligible resources to recover their fully allocated costs and a fair return on equity. The “reliability and resiliency rate” would be available to eligible resources operating within FERC-approved independent system operators or regional transmission organizations with energy and capacity markets. The rate would apply only to generators that are not currently subject to cost-of-service regulation by a state or other authority. On January 8, 2018, FERC unanimously denied the petition and requested additional information from power grid operators thus putting off any new rulemaking by at least two months, dismissing the Secretary’s call to act immediately. FERC  has opened  a new proceeding to “take additional steps to explore resilience issues in the [regional transmission organizations and independent system operators].” That docket will aim to develop an understanding of what resilience actually means for the grid and to understand how each grid operator addresses the issue.
Wyoming Land Quality Division Self-Bonding Rules. On August 20, 2018, the Wyoming Land Quality Division, through the Land Quality Advisory Board, offered for public comment proposed changes to self-bonding rules related to reclamation obligations. The proposal included requiring that the self-bonding guarantor be the ultimate parent company and that the maximum amount of bonding be limited to 75% of the company’s calculated bond amount. Additionally, the proposal required the self-bonding party to be of investment grade quality using ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating services, such as the Moody’s Investor Service or Standard and Poor’s Corporation. This requirement would replace the current qualifying tests using a bonding party’s audited financial statements.
The Company currently meets all its bonding obligations in Wyoming through the use of commercial surety bonds. If the proposed rule becomes effective, the Company would not qualify for self-bonding based on its current credit rating. The proposed rule was approved by the Wyoming Land Quality Advisory Board on September 19, 2018 and the Environmental Quality Council on February 19, 2019. It will now be sent to the Governor for his signature to become effective.
Federal Report on Climate Change. On November 23, 2018, the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a working group comprised of 13 U.S. governmental departments and agencies, issued the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The report lists the observed effects of “increasing greenhouse gas concentrations on Earth’s climate” and enumerates the impacts of those observed effects. The report also discusses the alternatives for reducing the impacts of climate-related risks, including through mitigation and adaptation. While there are no explicit regulatory actions that flow from the issuance of the report, both the legislative and executive branches of government may rely on its conclusions to shape and justify policies and actions going forward.
Regulatory Matters — Australia 
The Australian mining industry is regulated by Australian federal, state and local governments with respect to environmental issues such as land reclamation, water quality, air quality, dust control, noise, planning issues (such as approvals to expand existing mines or to develop new mines) and health and safety issues. The Australian federal government retains control over the level of foreign investment and export approvals. Industrial relations are regulated under both federal and state laws. Australian state governments also require coal companies to post deposits or give other security against land which is being used for mining, with those deposits being returned or security released after satisfactory reclamation is completed.

Native Title and Cultural Heritage. Since 1992, the Australian courts have recognized that native title to lands and water, as recognized under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia, may have survived the process of European settlement. These developments are supported by the federal Native Title Act which recognizes and protects native title, and under which a national register of native title claims has been established. Native title rights do not extend to minerals; however, native title rights can be affected by mining activities unless those rights have previously been extinguished, thereby requiring negotiation with the traditional owners (and potentially the payment of compensation) prior to the grant of certain mining tenements. There is also federal and state legislation to prevent damage to Aboriginal cultural heritage and archaeological sites.
Mining Tenements and Environmental. In Queensland and New South Wales, the development of a mine requires both the grant of a right to extract the resource and an approval which authorizes the environmental impact. These approvals are obtained under separate legislation from separate government authorities. However, the application processes run concurrently and are also concurrent with any native title or cultural heritage process that is required. The environmental impacts of mining projects are regulated by state and federal governments. Federal regulation will only apply if the particular project will significantly impact a matter of national environmental significance (for example, a water resource, an endangered species or particular protected places). Environmental approvals processes involve complex issues that, on occasion, require lengthy studies and documentation. A recent decision of the New South Wales Land and Environment Court refused planning approval for a non-Peabody mining project (Gloucester Resources Limited v Minister for Planning). The judge in that case considered the relevance of downstream greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the consumption of coal to be mined under the proposed project. The decision adds to an existing body of Australian case law concerning greenhouse gas emissions of mining projects and how they are to be assessed in the context of planning approvals, including planning approvals for Peabody mining projects. Typically mining proponents must also reach agreement with the owners of land underlying proposed mining tenements prior to the grant and/or conduct of mining activities or otherwise acquire the land. These arrangements generally involve the payment of compensation in lieu of the impacts of mining on the land.
Our Australian mining operations are generally subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations. At the federal level, these include, but are not limited to, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, Native Title Act 1993, Fair Work Act 2009 and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. 
In Queensland, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mineral Resources Act 1989, Environmental Protection Act 1994 (EP Act), Environmental Protection Regulation 2008, Planning Act 2016, Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999, Minerals and Energy Resources (Common Provisions) Act 2014, Explosives Act 1999, Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2003, Water Act 2000, State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971, Queensland Heritage Act 1992, Transport Infrastructure Act 1994, Nature Conservation Act 1992, Vegetation Management Act 1999, Biosecurity Act 2014, Land Act 1994, Regional Planning Interests Act 2014, Fisheries Act 1994 and Forestry Act 1959. Under the EP Act, policies have been developed to achieve the objectives of the law and provide guidance on specific areas of the environment, including air, noise, water and waste management. State planning policies address matters of Queensland state interest, and must be adhered to during mining project approvals. The Mineral Resources Act 1989 was amended effective September 27, 2016 to include significant changes to the management of overlapping coal and coal seam gas tenements and the coordination of activities and access to private and public land. In November 2016, amendments to the EP Act and the Water Act 2000 became effective and facilitate regulatory scrutiny of the environmental impacts of underground water extraction during the operational phase of resource projects for all tenements yet to commence mineral extraction. The ‘chain of responsibility’ provisions of the EP Act, effective in April 2016, allow the regulator to issue an environmental protection order (EPO) to a related person of a company in two circumstances; (a) if an EPO has been issued to the company, an EPO can also be issued to a related person of the company (at the same time or later); or (b) if the company is a high risk company (as defined in the EP Act), an EPO can be issued to a related person of the company (whether or not an EPO has also been issued to the company). A guideline has been issued that provides more certainty to the industry on the circumstances in which an EPO may be issued.
In New South Wales, laws and regulations related to mining include, but are not limited to, the Mining Act 1992, Work Health and Safety (Mines) Act 2013, Coal Mine Subsidence Compensation Act 2017, Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (EPA Act), Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulations 2000, Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, Contaminated Land Management Act 1997, Explosives Act 2003, Water Management Act 2000, Water Act 1912, Radiation Control Act 1990, Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (BC Act), Heritage Act 1977, Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983, Crown Land Management Act 2016, Dangerous Goods (Road and Rail Transport) Act 2008, Fisheries Management Act 1994, Forestry Act 2012, Native Title (New South Wales) Act 1994, Biosecurity Act 2015, Roads Act 1993 and National Parks & Wildlife Act 1974.

Under the EPA Act, environmental planning instruments must be considered when approving a mining project development application. Decision makers review the significance of a resource and the state and regional economic benefits of a proposed coal mine when considering a development application on the basis that it is an element of the “public interest” consideration contained in the relevant legislation. Effective from March 1, 2018, the EPA Act was amended to introduce a number of changes to planning laws in New South Wales. The EPA Act was further amended in June 2018 to revoke a process for modifying development approvals under the former section 75W of the EPA Act. As a result, new development approvals will need to be obtained unless the proposed project will be substantially the same development as it was when the development approval was last modified under section 75W, in which case the existing development approval can be modified. If a new development approval is required then this could take additional time to achieve.
On August 25, 2017, the BC Act commenced in New South Wales and imposes a revised framework for the assessment of potential impacts on biodiversity that may be caused by a development, such as a proposed mining project. The BC Act requires these potential impacts on biodiversity to be offset in perpetuity, by one or more of the following means: securing land based offsets and retiring biodiversity credits, making a payment into a biodiversity conservation fund or in some cases through mine site ecological rehabilitation. The data collected from the biodiversity impact assessment process is inputted into a new offsets payment calculator in order to determine the amount payable by the proponent to offset the impacts. The proposed development can only proceed once the biodiversity offset obligations have been satisfied.
Mining Rehabilitation (Reclamation). Mine reclamation is regulated by state-specific legislation. As a condition of approval for mining operations, companies are required to progressively reclaim mined land and provide appropriate bonding to the relevant state government as a safeguard to cover the costs of reclamation in circumstances where mine operators are unable to do so. Self-bonding is not permitted. Our mines provide financial assurance to the relevant authorities which is calculated in accordance with current regulatory requirements. This financial assurance is in the form of cash, surety bonds or bank guarantees which are supported by a combination of cash collateral, deeds of indemnity and guarantee and letters of credit issued under our credit facility and accounts receivable securitization program. We operate in both the Queensland and New South Wales state jurisdictions. 
Our reclamation bonding requirements in Australia were $225.4 million as of December 31, 2018. The bond requirements represent the calculated cost to reclaim the current operations of a mine if it ceases to operate in the current period less any discounts agreed with the state. The cost calculation for each bond must be completed according to the regulatory authority of each state. The costs associated with our Australian asset retirement obligations are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and were $246.9 million as of December 31, 2018. The total bonding requirements for our Australian operations differ from the calculated costs associated with the asset retirement obligations because the costs associated with asset retirement obligations are discounted from the end of the mine’s economic life to the balance sheet date in recognition of the economic reality that reclamation is conducted progressively and final reclamation is a number of years (and in some cases decades) away, whereas the bonding amount represents the cost of reclamation if a mine ceases to operate immediately. The bond requirement is lower than the asset retirement obligation as the bond calculation includes the discounts noted above and excludes certain of our mining overhead costs that would not be applicable if the government managed the closure process.
New South Wales Reclamation. The Mining Act 1992 (Mining Act) is administered by the Department of Planning and Environment and the New South Wales Resources Regulator and authorizes the holder of a mining tenement to extract a mineral subject to obtaining consent under the EPA Act and other auxiliary approvals and licenses. 
Through the Mining Act, environmental protection and reclamation are regulated by conditions in all mining leases including requirements for the submission of a mining operations plan (MOP) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the MOP which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and reclamation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines publicly report their reclamation performance on an annual basis. 
In support of the MOP process, a reclamation cost estimate is calculated periodically to determine the amount of bond support required to cover the cost of reclamation based on the extent of disturbance during the MOP period.
Queensland Reclamation. The EP Act is administered by the Department of Environment and Science which authorizes environmentally relevant activities such as mining activities relating to a mining lease through an Environmental Authority (EA). Environmental protection and reclamation activities are regulated by conditions in the EA, including the requirement for the submission of a plan of operations (PO) prior to the commencement of operations. All mining operations must be carried out in accordance with the PO which describes site activities and the progress toward environmental and rehabilitation outcomes and are updated on a regular basis or if mine plans change. The mines submit an annual return reporting on their EA compliance including reclamation performance.
As a condition of the EA, bonding requirements are calculated to determine the amount of bonding required to cover the cost of reclamation based on the extent of disturbance during the PO period.

On November 19, 2018, the Queensland government passed the Mineral and Energy Resources (Financial Provisioning) Act 2018 providing for a new financial assurance (FA) framework and new progressive rehabilitation requirements. The new FA framework creates a pooled fund covering most mines and most of the total industry liability, plus other options for providing FA if not part of the pooled fund (for example, allowing insurance bonds or cash). The percentage rate of the total rehabilitation cost payable into the pooled fund will take into account the financial strength of the holder of the EA for the mine and the project strength of the mine. The total rehabilitation cost is determined using an updated rehabilitation cost calculator, which no longer provides for discounting. The commencement date for the new FA framework is April 1, 2019 and there will be a transitional period. The Company is waiting to receive guidelines from the government on how the new FA framework will be applied in respect of the Company’s Queensland mines.
The new progressive rehabilitation requirements will commence on November 1, 2019 and will require each mine to establish a schedule of rehabilitation milestones covering the life of the mine, and any significant changes to the timing of rehabilitation will require regulatory approval. If there is to remain an area within the mine that is not to be rehabilitated such that it does not have a post-mining land use (referred to as a non-use management area or NUMA) then each such NUMA will need to pass a public interest evaluation test as part of the approval process. An example of a NUMA is the void that remains after open-cut mining activities have been completed. Under the legislation, each current mine is exempt from the requirement to justify its existing NUMAs to the extent that its current approvals provide for such areas. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the new rehabilitation requirements on its Queensland mines including whether there will be a need to seek any further regulatory approvals for any of the NUMAs at any of those mines.
Residual Risks. On November 19, 2018 the Queensland government released for public consultation a discussion paper on managing ‘residual risks’ of mining activities. On completion of all mining activities, the holder of the EA for the mine can apply to surrender the EA once all conditions, requirements and rehabilitation obligations have been met. When approving the surrender, the government can request a residual risk payment from the holder of the EA for the mine to cover potential rehabilitation or maintenance costs incurred after the surrender has been accepted. The discussion paper contemplates two approaches for determining residual risk payments. Depending on the level of risk of a particular site, a cost calculator tool might be used or a panel of appropriately qualified experts might undertake a qualitative and quantitative risk assessment. Industry and the Company continue to consult with the government on the proposed residual risk payment regime.
Federal Reclamation. In February 2017, the Australian Senate established a Committee of Inquiry into the rehabilitation of mining and resources projects as it relates to Commonwealth responsibilities, for example, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Committee is expected to issue a report in due course.
Occupational Health and Safety. State legislation requires us to provide and maintain a safe workplace by providing safe systems of work, safety equipment and appropriate information, instruction, training and supervision. In recognition of the specialized nature of mining and mining activities, specific occupational health and safety obligations have been mandated under state legislation specific to the coal mining industry. There are some differences in the application and detail of the laws, and mining operators, directors, officers and certain other employees are all subject to the obligations under this legislation.
Starting in 2015, a small number of coal mine workers in Queensland and New South Wales have been diagnosed with coal workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP, also known as black lung) following decades of assumed eradication of the disease. The Queensland government held a Parliamentary inquiry into the re-emergence of CWP in the state which included public hearings with appearances by representatives of the coal mining industry, coal mine workers, the regulator and others. The Queensland Parliamentary Committee conducting the inquiry issued its final report on May 29, 2017. In finding that it is highly unlikely CWP was ever eradicated in Queensland, the Committee made 68 recommendations to ensure the safety and health of coal mine workers. These include an immediate reduction to the occupational exposure limit for respirable coal dust equivalent to 1.5mg/m3 for coal dust and 0.05 mg/m3 for silica and the establishment of a new and independent Mine Safety Authority to be funded by a dedicated proportion of coal and mineral royalties and overseeing the Mines Safety Inspectorate. The Queensland government has instituted increased reporting requirements for dust monitoring results, broader coal mine worker health assessment requirements and voluntary retirement examinations for coal mine workers to be arranged by the relevant employer and further reform may follow.
Since August 2017, the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 2003 provides for a medical examination process for retired or former coal workers with suspected CWP, an additional lump sum compensation for workers with CWP, and clarifying that a worker with CWP can access further workers’ compensation entitlements if they experience disease progression.
On October 31, 2018 the Queensland government passed the Mines Legislation (Resources Safety) Amendment Act 2018, which introduces significant changes to the Coal Mining Safety and Health Act 1999 concerning, among other things, duties of officers, reporting requirements for coal mine worker diseases, reporting defects and hazards affecting plant and substances, contractor and service provider safety and health management plans, new powers to suspend or cancel an individual’s statutory certificate of competency and increasing penalties and inspector powers.

Industrial Relations. A national industrial relations system administered by the federal government applies to all private sector employers and employees. The matters regulated under the national system include employment conditions, unfair dismissal, enterprise bargaining, bullying claims, industrial action and resolution of workplace disputes. Many of the workers employed in our mines are covered by enterprise agreements approved under the national system. 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER Act). The NGER Act imposes requirements for corporations meeting a certain threshold to register and report greenhouse gas emissions and abatement actions, as well as energy production and consumption as part of a single, national reporting system. The Clean Energy Regulator administers the NGER Act. The federal Department of Environment and Energy is responsible for NGER Act-related policy developments and review.
On July 1, 2016, amendments to the NGER Act implemented the Emissions Reduction Fund Safeguard Mechanism.  From that date, large designated facilities such as coal mines were issued with a baseline for their covered emissions and must take steps to keep their emissions at or below the baseline or face penalties.
Queensland Royalty. Royalties are payable to the State of Queensland at a rate of 12.5% on coal prices over $100 Australian dollars per tonne and up to $150 Australian dollars per tonne and 15% on pricing over $150 Australian dollars per tonne. The rate is 7% for coal sold below $100 Australian dollars per tonne. The periodic impact of these royalty rates is dependent upon the volume of tonnes produced at each of our Queensland mining locations and coal prices received for those tonnes. The Queensland Office of State Revenue issues determinations setting out its interpretation of the laws that impose royalties and provide guidance on how royalty rates should be calculated.
New South Wales Royalty. In New South Wales, the royalty applicable to coal is charged as a percentage of the value of production (total revenue less allowable deductions). This is equal to 6.2% for deep underground mines (coal extracted at depths greater than 400 meters below ground surface), 7.2% for underground mines and 8.2% for open-cut mines.
Sydney Water Catchment Areas. In November 2017, the New South Wales government established an independent expert panel (Panel) to advise the Department of Planning and Environment on the impact of underground mining activities in Sydney’s water catchment areas, including at Peabody’s Metropolitan Mine. The Panel issued an initial report to the government in November 2018, which was released by the government on December 20, 2018. The initial report only concerns mining activities at two mines, Peabody’s Metropolitan Mine and a competitor’s Dendrobium Mine. A final report is currently expected to be issued in August 2019, which will cover mining activities and effects across the catchment as a whole, with a particular focus on risks to the quantity of water available, the environmental consequences for swamps and the issue of cumulative impacts.
The Panel’s initial report acknowledges the major effort at the Metropolitan and Dendrobium Mines over the last decade to employ best practice modeling and assessment methods undertaken by suitable experts, while recommending continued rigorous monitoring and impact assessment in order to build on the knowledge base regarding mining-induced subsidence and its impacts on groundwater and surface water. The initial report endorses the government taking an incremental approach to mining approvals that provides for considering existing and emerging information and knowledge gaps. The latest extraction plans for the Metropolitan Mine are progressing on an incremental basis and Peabody continues to conduct robust monitoring, data collection and reporting and has been actively consulting with the government on Metropolitan’s approval processes and mine design to ensure that operational impacts are appropriately managed and minimized as far as possible.
Global Climate 
In the U.S., Congress has considered legislation addressing global climate issues and greenhouse gas emissions, but to date, no such legislation has been signed into law. While it is possible that the U.S. will adopt legislation in the future, the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are uncertain. In the absence of new U.S. federal legislation, the EPA is undertaking steps to regulate greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the CAA. In response to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, the EPA commenced several rulemaking projects as described under “Regulatory Matters - U.S.” In particular, in 2015, the EPA announced final rules (known as the CPP) for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing and new fossil fuel-fired EGUs. Twenty-seven states and governmental entities, as well as utilities, industry groups, trade associations, coal companies (including Peabody), and other entities, challenged the CPP in federal court.
Since 2016, implementation of the CPP has been stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court pending resolution of its legal challenges. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to change its legal interpretation of section 111(d) of the CAA, the authority that the agency relied on for the original CPP. If this proposed reinterpretation were finalized by the EPA, the CPP would be repealed.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 21

The EPA relied on the proposed reinterpretation until August 2018, when it proposed the ACE Rule, which would replace the CPP with a system where states will develop emissions reduction plans using BSER measures (essentially efficiency heat rate improvements), and the EPA will approve the state plans if they use EPA-approved candidate technologies. Changes in the NSR program are also proposed to allow efficiency improvements to be made without triggering NSR requirements. If adopted, ACE will provide states with the flexibility to regulate on a plant-by-plant basis with a focus on coal-fired EGUs. Public comments on the rule were due October 31, 2018, and the EPA is expected to finalize the rule during 2019. Litigation may be initiated, however, and the final timeline may shift.
At the same time, a number of states in the U.S. have adopted programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. For example, 10 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont) entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in 2005, which is a mandatory cap-and-trade program to cap regional carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. In 2011, New Jersey announced its withdrawal from RGGI effective January 1, 2012. Six mid-western states (Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin) and one Canadian province have entered into the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGGRA) to establish voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a voluntary multi-sector cap-and-trade system to help meet the targets. It has been reported that, while the MGGRA has not been formally suspended, the participating states are no longer pursuing it. Seven western states (Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington) and four Canadian provinces entered into the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) in 2008 to establish a voluntary regional greenhouse gas reduction goal and develop market-based strategies to achieve emissions reductions. However, in November 2011, the WCI announced that six states had withdrawn from the WCI, leaving California and four Canadian provinces as the remaining members. Of those five jurisdictions, only California and Quebec have adopted greenhouse gas cap-and-trade regulations to date and both programs have begun operating. Many of the states and provinces that left WCI, RGGI and MGGRA, along with many that continue to participate, have joined the new North America 2050 initiative, which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create economic opportunities in ways not limited to cap-and-trade programs. 
Several other U.S. states have enacted legislation establishing greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals or requirements. In addition, several states have enacted legislation or have in effect regulations requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power or that provide financial incentives to electricity suppliers for using renewable energy sources. Some states have initiated public utility proceedings that may establish values for carbon emissions.
We participated in the Department of Energy’s Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program until its suspension in May 2011, and we regularly disclose in our Corporate and Social Responsibility Report the quantity of emissions per ton of coal produced by us in the U.S. The vast majority of our emissions are generated by the operation of heavy machinery to extract and transport material at our mines and fugitive emissions from the extraction of coal.
In 2013, the U.S. and a number of international development banks, including the World Bank, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, announced that they would no longer provide financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants or would do so only in narrowly defined circumstances. Other international development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, have continued to provide such financing. Other banks (such as BNP Paribas and HSBC) have pledged to end financing of certain fossil fuel projects and companies. Some insurance companies (such as Zurich and Swiss Re) have announced that they will no longer insure coal operations and companies. And some large investors (including Lloyd’s of London) have announced that they plan to divest coal stocks from their investment holdings.
The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in December 1997 by the signatories to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), established a binding set of greenhouse gas emission targets for developed nations. The U.S. signed the Kyoto Protocol but it has never been ratified by the U.S. Senate. Australia ratified the Kyoto Protocol in December 2007 and became a full member in March 2008.  There were discussions to develop a treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol after the expiration of its commitment period in 2012, including at the UNFCCC conferences in Cancun (2010), Durban (2011), Doha (2012) and Paris (2015). At the Durban conference, an ad hoc working group was established to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the UNFCCC, applicable to all parties. At the Doha meeting, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, which included new commitments for certain parties in a second commitment period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2012, Australia signed on to the second commitment period. During the UNFCCC conference in Paris, France in late 2015, an agreement was adopted calling for voluntary emissions reductions contributions after the second commitment period ends in 2020. The agreement was entered into force on November 4, 2016 after ratification and execution by more than 55 countries, including Australia, that account for at least 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, which cannot be completed until 2020 under the terms of the agreement.

Peabody Energy Corporation | 2018 Form 10-K | 22

Australia’s Parliament passed carbon pricing legislation in November 2011. The first program involved the imposition of a carbon tax that commenced in July 2012. On July 16, 2014, Australia’s Parliament repealed the legislation, which was retrospectively abolished from July 1, 2014. 
In October 2017, the Australian Federal Government released a plan aimed at delivering an affordable and reliable energy system that meets Australia’s international commitments to emissions reduction. The plan was referred to as the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) and was aimed at changing the National Electricity Market and associated legislative framework. The NEG was abandoned by the Australian government in September 2018. The current Coalition government has confirmed that it remains committed to meeting Australia’s Paris Agreement targets but that the focus of energy policy will be on driving down electricity prices. The opposition Labor party has indicated that it will adopt a NEG-style energy policy if it wins the next Federal election and has committed to a 45% emissions reduction target by 2030, based on 2005 levels. This compares to the Coalition’s previous target under the NEG of a 26% reduction by 2030, which is in line with the Paris Agreement. The Labor party has also committed to a 50% renewables energy target by 2030.
Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the use of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit such emissions, could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power stations could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. The potential financial impact on us of future laws, regulations or other policies will depend upon the degree to which any such laws or regulations force electricity generators to diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws, regulations or other policies, the time periods over which those laws, regulations or other policies would be phased in, the state of development and deployment of CCUS technologies as well as acceptance of CCUS technologies to meet regulations and the alternative uses for coal. Similarly, higher-efficiency coal-fired power plants may also be an option for meeting laws or regulations related to emissions from coal use. Several countries, including some major coal users such as China, India and Japan, included using higher-efficiency coal-fueled power plants in their plans under the Paris Agreement. From time to time, we attempt to analyze the potential impact on the Company of as-yet-unadopted, potential laws, regulations and policies. Such analyses require that we make significant assumptions as to the specific provisions of such potential laws, regulations and policies. These analyses sometimes show that certain potential laws, regulations and policies, if implemented in the manner assumed by the analyses, could result in material adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow, in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these potential laws, regulations and policies. We do not believe that such analyses reasonably predict the quantitative impact that future laws, regulations or other policies may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
