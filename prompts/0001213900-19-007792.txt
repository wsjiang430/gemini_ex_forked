Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 
We are a technology driven, omni-channel company that designs, manufactures and sells unique, high quality furniture comprised of modular couches called Sactionals and premium foam beanbag chairs called Sacs. We market and sell our products through modern and efficient showrooms and, increasingly, through online sales. We believe that our ecommerce centric approach, coupled with our ability to deliver our large upholstered products through nationwide express couriers, is unique to the furniture industry.
 
The name “Lovesac” was derived from our original innovative product, a premium foam beanbag chair, the Sac. The Sac was developed in 1995 and provided the foundation for the Company. We believe that the large size, comfortable foam filling and irreverent branding of our Sacs products have been instrumental in growing a loyal customer base and our positive, fun image.
 
Our Sactionals product line currently represents a majority of our sales. Sactionals are a couch system that consists of two components, seats and sides, which can be arranged, rearranged and expanded into thousands of configurations easily and without tools. Our Sactional products include a number of patented features relating to its geometry and modularity, coupling mechanisms and other features. We believe that these high quality premium priced products enhance our brand image and customer loyalty and expect them to continue to garner a significant share of our sales.
 
Sacs and Sactionals come in a wide variety of colors and fabrics that allow consumers to customize their purchases in numerous configurations and styles. We provide lifetime warranties on our Sactionals frames and the proprietary foam used in both product lines, and 3 year warranties on our covers. Our Designed for Life trademark reflects our dynamic product line that is built to last and evolve throughout a customer’s life. Customers can continually update their Sacs and Sactionals with new covers, additions and configurations to accommodate the changes in their family and housing situations.
 
We believe that our products complement one another and have generated a loyal customer base. We believe the strength of our brand is reflected in the number of customers who routinely share their purchases of Lovesac products with their friends through social media, often displaying our logos or company name in their posts. Our customers include celebrities and other influencers who support our brand through postings made on an uncompensated and unsolicited basis.
 
We currently market and sell our products in over 75 showrooms at top tier malls, lifestyle centers and street locations in 30 states in the U.S. Our modern, efficient showrooms are designed to appeal to millennials and other purchasers looking for comfortable, enduring, premium furniture. They showcase the different sizes of our Sacs, the myriad forms into which our Sactionals can be configured, and the large variety of fabrics that can be used to cover our products. Our retail showrooms are technology driven and focused on educating prospective customers about the many benefits of our unique products, enabling us to require just 506 to 1,350 square feet for each showroom.
 
As part of our direct to consumer sales approach, we also sell our products through our fast growing ecommerce platform. We believe our products are uniquely suited to this channel. Our foam-based Sacs can be reduced to one-eighth of their normal size and each of our Sactionals components weighs less than 50 pounds upon shipping. Our showrooms and other direct marketing efforts work in concert to drive customer conversion in ecommerce.

Company History
 
The Company was formed in the State of Delaware on January 3, 2017, in connection with a corporate reorganization with SAC Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, the predecessor entity to the Company and current majority shareholder of the Company. Our common stock began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol “LOVE” on June 27, 2018 and we consummated our initial public offering of 4,025,000 shares of our common stock, or our IPO, on June 29, 2018, at a public offering price of $16.00 per share.
Product Overview
 
We challenge the notion that a piece of furniture is static by offering a dynamic product line built to last and evolve throughout a customer’s life. Our products serve as a set of building blocks that can be rearranged, restyled and re-upholstered with any new setting, mitigating constant changes in fashion and style. Traditional couches, chairs and sectionals are sold as static products, purchased and used for a current and specific need in the home. As a result, we believe the industry is beholden to the uncertainties of fashion, seasonality, and style, including the accompanying inventory risk.

● | Sactionals. We believe our Sactionals platform is unlike competing products in its adaptability, yet is comparable aesthetically to similarly priced premium couches and sectionals. Our Sactional products include a number of patented features relating to its geometry and modularity, coupling mechanisms and other features Utilizing only two, standardized pieces, “seats” and “sides,” and over 250 high quality, tight-fitting covers that are removable, washable, and changeable, making our Sactionals fully customizable at initial purchase and throughout their product lifecycle providing consumers with thousands of style and layout options with minimal effort. Customization is further enhanced with our specialty-shaped modular offerings, such as our wedge seat and roll arm side. Our custom features and accessories can be added easily and quickly to a Sactional to meet endless design, style and utility preferences, reflecting our Designed for Life philosophy.

● | Sacs. Our original innovative product, the Sac, is one of the most comfortable premium beanbag chairs. The Sac product line offers 6 different sizes ranging from 22 pounds to 95 pounds with capacity to seat 3+ people on the larger model Sacs. Filled with Durafoam, a blend of shredded foam, Sacs provide serene comfort and durability, guaranteed never to go flat, no matter the amount of use. Its removable cover is machine washable and may be easily replaced by purchasing one of our 300+ cover offerings. Sacs are manufactured using patented methods that allow for compression of some components of the Sac product, which facilitates shipping and handling of Sacs. This patented method allows us to shrink the Sac to an eighth of its original volume so that it fits inside a duffle bag. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accessories. Our accessories complement our Sacs and Sactionals by increasing their adaptability to meet evolving consumer demands and preferences. Our current product line offers Sactional-specific drink holders, footsac blankets, decorative pillows, fitted seat tables and ottomans in varying styles and finishes, providing our customers with the flexibility to customize their furnishings with decorative and practical add-ons to meet evolving style preferences. We are in the process of developing additional accessories for the tech-savvy consumer and have recently launched the sale of the Power Hub charging accessory for Sactionals.

Sales Channels
 
We offer our products through an omni-channel platform that provides a seamless and meaningful experience to our customers online and in-store. Compared to traditional retailers, our showrooms require significantly less square footage because of our need to have only a few in-store sample configurations for display and our ability to stack our inventory for immediate sale. Our retail showrooms are technology driven and focused on educating prospective customers about the many benefits of our unique products, enabling us to require just 506 to 1,350 square feet for each showroom. The small footprint requirement provides a cost advantage and flexibility in locating our showrooms strategically in A-rated malls and street locations in our target markets. These logistical advantages underlie our broader tech-driven, internet-based business model, where we leverage our showrooms as both a traditional retail channel to purchase our products and an educational center for prospective online customers to learn about and interact with our products in real time.

Through our fast growing mobile and ecommerce channel, we are able to significantly enhance the consumer shopping experience for home furnishings, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, while simultaneously driving favorable margin expansion. Our technology capabilities are robust, and we are well positioned to benefit from the growing consumer preference to transact via mobile devices. We leverage our strong social media presence and showroom footprint to drive traffic toward our ecommerce platform, where product testimonials and inspirational stories from our Lovesac community create a more engaging consumer experience for our customers. Additionally, our products’ compact packaging facilitates consistent production scheduling, outsourcing of delivery and lower shipping costs, demonstrating our logistical ability to quickly and cost-effectively deliver online orders.
 
We have also enhanced our sales through the use of shop in shops. We have an ongoing working relationship with Costco to operate shop in shop showrooms that typically average ten days at a time. The shop in shop showrooms display select Sacs and Sactionals and are staffed with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products. We continue to explore other shop in shop partnerships and opportunities to promote our products and facilitate customers interacting with our products in the real world.
 
Customers
 

● | Robust customer lifetime value. The fiscal 2019 cohort had an average first year value of $1,540 per new customer, and this is the highest first year value of all cohorts we have tracked since fiscal 2015 and 21% higher than the 3 year benchmark fiscal 2015 cohort whose Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is currently $1,277 which increased from $1,236 in fiscal 2018. We believe this is an outcome of our decision to focus on driving penetration of Sactionals. We calculated our fiscal 2019 cohort CLV by dividing the aggregate gross profits through fiscal 2019 attributed to the fiscal 2019 cohort (approximately $99,613,884) by the total number of new customers from fiscal 2019 (64,686). In addition, our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) was $309.46 for fiscal 2019. This is an increase from our fiscal 2018 CAC which was $283.22. This increase is attributable to our increase in marketing spend targeted at Sactional customers. We expect our CAC to continue to increase as we continue to target Sactional customers. We expect this increase in CAC to correspond with a continued increase in CLV. Our CLV/CAC ratio for fiscal 2019 was 4.98 compared to 4.36 for fiscal 2018. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Target Demographics. Based on our internal data, our typical customer is 25 to 45 years in age with an annual household income of over $100,000. We consider this to be an attractive demographic because of its higher than average rates of household formation and furniture purchasing. Members of the millennial demographic, our primary target market, are entering this age group daily. Our customers have different tastes, styles, purchasing goals and budgets when shopping for couches, and our Sactionals platform’s modularity addresses this wide array of needs. 

Competitive Strengths
 
Our consumers often cross-shop Lovesac with companies such as Crate and Barrel, Pottery Barn, Arhaus, Restoration Hardware, Ikea, Joybird and Wayfair. We believe that the following strengths are central to the power of our brand and business model:
Innovative Business Model


● | Merchandising Strategy. Many home furnishings retailers, online or offline, rely on an assortment of new offerings each season to drive their business and to refashion their offerings. We have avoided this “merchandising” approach in favor of a product platform-based approach that reduces the need for seasonal introductions, designer collections, or broad in-stock assortments. We optimize our in-stock assortment of covers and accessories by limiting them to those that sell in large quantity and therefore present lower risk. We also provide a broad assortment of made-to-order items, which we manufacture after the consumer has purchased and paid for them. This business model yields little to no surplus inventory, less margin erosion due to overstock write-downs, higher than average annual inventory turns, increased focus at the showroom management level, and simplicity at merchandising-display execution. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Product Platform Approach. We have two primary platforms upon which we develop, manufacture and sell our fundamental Sacs and Sactionals products. We market our product platforms as a long term investment that our customers can continually update with new arrangements, coverings and accessories. In turn, these changes and updates provide a recurring revenue source for our business. In addition, our Sactionals platform is an environmentally conscious alternative to fixed couches that tend to be discarded when they go out of style or wear out, a by-product of our Designed for Life approach and an important feature to some consumers.

● | Ecommerce Focus. We build our business processes, systems, compensation structures, and logistical models with an ecommerce-first approach. We continually innovate to make shopping online easier for our customers, and we use social media to drive increased traffic to our web-based sales applications. From a product standpoint, the open-cell nature of the Durafoam filler in our Sacs allows them to be compressed for shipping to one-eighth of their normal size. To facilitate shipping, Sactionals seat cushions and back pillows are compressed to fit inside an otherwise hollow hardwood upholstered seat frame. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | A Culture of Innovation. From inception, we have focused on developing unique, innovative and proprietary product platforms. We are continuously expanding and introducing new extensions to these platforms to broaden the appeal and grow the addressable market of our product offerings. We continually evaluate new products to complement our Sactionals and Sac lines and are currently developing accessories for the tech-savvy consumer. We have 16 issued U.S. utility patents and 21 issued foreign utility patents, 6 pending U.S. utility patent applications, 36 pending foreign utility patent applications and 3 pending international patent applications. We expect to file U.S. and international patent applications for future innovations. We believe that our patent portfolio, combined with our innovative design approach may deter others from attempting to imitate or replicate our products. 

Strong Brand Loyalty
 
We believe our brand, products, and Designed for Life philosophy encourage people to share their stories and develop a personal relationship with Lovesac and its community. We foster these interactions through active direct engagement using all of the most prolific social media platforms. These are products that move, and change, and rearrange. They are soft, and comfortable, and fun to jump on. We believe that all of this causes our customers to uniquely be active ambassadors, providing organic public relations, word of mouth advertising, and customer testimonials and endorsements. In addition, our customers have a high repeat purchasing rate and high expected lifetime engagement.

● | High repeat purchasing rates. We believe our focus on customer interaction and data driven analysis of their behavior and projected needs, drives our high customer repeat rates. In fiscal 2019, our repeat customers accounted for 38% of all transactions. This represents 1pt of the mix of transactions moving into new customer transactions. We expect new transactions to continue to become a larger portion of our transaction mix as we spend on acquisition. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Robust Customer Lifetime Value. Once customers invest in our products, they tend to stay with them, grow with them, and add to them. We believe our customers’ loyalty is an important driver of our CLV. An example of this is that our fiscal 2015 cohort has increased its CLV by 19.3% since year end fiscal 2015.We calculated our fiscal 2015 CLV by dividing the aggregate gross profits through fiscal 2018 attributable to the 2015 cohort (approximately $41,147,646,) by the total number of customers in the 2015 cohort (38,423 customers). 

 
Omni-Channel Approach
 
Our distribution strategy allows us to reach customers through three distinct, brand-enhancing channels, which we refer to as our omni-channel approach.
 

● | Ecommerce. Through our mobile and ecommerce channel, we believe we are able to significantly enhance the consumer shopping experience, driving deeper brand engagement and loyalty, while also realizing margins than our showroom locations. We believe our robust technological capabilities position us well to benefit from the growing consumer preference to transact at home and via mobile devices. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Showrooms. We carefully select the best small-footprint retail locations in high-end malls and lifestyle centers for our showrooms. The architecture and layout of these showrooms is designed to communicate our brand personality and key product features. Our goal is to educate first-time customers, creating an environment where people can touch, feel, read, and understand the technology behind our products. We are updating and remodeling many of our showrooms to reflect our new showroom concept, which emphasizes our unique product platform, and will be the standard for future showrooms. Our new showroom concept, introduced in 2016, utilizes technology in more experiential ways to increase traffic and sales. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shop in shops. We are expanding the use of lower cost shop in shops to increase the number of locations where customers can experience and purchase our products. We have an ongoing working relationship with Costco to operate shop in shop programs, or “roadshows,” that usually run for 10 days at a time. These shop in shops are staffed similarly to our showrooms with associates trained to demonstrate and sell our products and promote our brand. We also believe our shop in shops provide a low cost alternative to drive brand awareness, in store sales, and ecommerce sales. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strong Millennial Appeal
 
We have targeted the millennial generation because we believe the desire brand products, coupled with transparent business practices, innovative solutions and the convenience of on-demand commerce. Additionally, members of the millennial generation, currently the most populous age group in the U.S., are completing their educations, getting married, and starting or expanding their households. The peak ages for home furnishings purchases are 35-54. We believe home furnishings will thrive as millennials and their children need larger residences and the necessary furnishings for household and family formation. The modularity of our Sactionals and ease of cleaning and replacing covers on Sactionals and Sacs provide our customers who are moving and expanding their households with the ability to evolve their purchases to accommodate the changes in their family and housing situations, offering us a competitive advantage.

Unique Distribution Capability
 
Due to the unique modularity of our Sactionals products and the shrinkability of our Sacs, we are able to distribute our products through nationwide express couriers and efficiently utilize warehouse space and international shipping routes. We believe our Sactionals are the only product in its category that enjoys this logistical advantage.
Growth Strategies
 
In order to position Lovesac for future growth, in the last several years we made significant investments in overhead, optimized and integrated our business technologies and processes, and further developed our marketing tactics. In addition, we have refocused our strategy regarding our showrooms, moving to higher end malls and lifestyle centers, to support digital sales, our primary growth channel. We have also altered a number of our lease arrangements to fixed versus variable rent structures. Finally, we have committed to a new showroom design creating a much more interactive, technology driven experience that has resulted in higher traffic levels and conversion than previous showroom models.
 
These long-term initiatives have required significant amount of management’s attention, which has shifted management’s focus away from short-term sales growth. As a result of these efforts, along with the implementation of the strategies noted below, we believe Lovesac is poised for meaningful sales growth. Our goal is to further improve our leadership in the home furnishings market by pursuing the following key strategies:
 
Continue to Build on Our Brand
 
Despite our loyal following, we believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our brand awareness. Based on our own internal study that was concluded in April 2017, we estimate that our brand awareness is less than 1% among all consumers nationally. Before 2017, we invested minimally in advertising. Since then, we have aggressively invested in brand building and direct marketing efforts, including direct mail, 30-second television commercials in select markets and social media. Our focus on building the Lovesac and Sactional brands has led to an increase in our new Sactional customer base, which grew by 55.8% in fiscal 2019. We plan to accelerate our ecommerce sales by building awareness via increased digital and social media, including digital videos and direct response television.
Update Showrooms and Add Other Locations
 
We intend to continue to renovate our current showroom locations, open new showrooms across the country in lifestyle centers, top tier shopping malls, and high street and urban locations, and expand product touch-feel points through the increased use of shop in shop locations. Because of their small size and above average productivity, we believe our approach to our showrooms creates a compelling opportunity to open more showrooms in a wide variety of retail spaces across North America.

● | Showrooms. In our showrooms, we focus on offering potential customers the opportunity to experience the considerable flexibility they have in selecting fabrics and configurations. We are evolving our model for new showrooms and renovating our existing showrooms to reflect the standards of our new model. Our new showroom concept utilizes technology in more experiential ways to increase traffic and sales and communicate our brand personality and key product features. To attract customer traffic, our new model features two giant LED screens embedded in the walls that play videos demonstrating the Sactionals technology in motion. The entire architecture and layout of these new showrooms have been redesigned to communicate the brand personality and key product features, with the goal to educate first-time customers and create a self-service environment where people can touch, feel, read, and understand the technology behind our products. LED screens on the walls and iPads in the hands of the staff enhance what we believe is a “virtually merchandised” showroom in a very small footprint. In connection with these renovations, we have experienced increased sales and negotiated more favorable lease terms. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shop in shops. We have an ongoing working relationship with Costco to operate shop in shop showrooms. We have been expanding the use of these shop in shop showrooms, and plan to seek other partners to operate similar concept showrooms, to increase the number of locations where customers can experience and purchase our products at a lower cost to us than our permanent showrooms. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase Sales and Operating Margins
 
We seek to increase sales and operating margins through our premium pricing strategy and omni-channel platform, which we believe will require relatively small near term increases in fixed overhead.

● | Premium pricing. Lovesac’s products are positioned in the premium couch segment of the furniture market. We market as premium products because of our proprietary foam fillings, higher quality materials and unique modularity requiring a distinct level of manufacturing capability. At our price point, we offer a unique value proposition that combines both beautiful aesthetics and utility to our customers that we believe our competitors cannot offer. Additionally, our high end branding strategy, further enhanced by our unsolicited celebrity endorsements and large social media following, commands premium pricing, as we feel lowering prices may negatively affect perception of our products. The difference is explained by our platform approach, where once a customer buys their first couch, the cost of expanding and adding to it over time is much less expensive than the traditional method of purchasing another new couch to replace the old one. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Omni-Channel Platform. By leveraging our omni-channel platform, we cost-effectively drive traffic to our ecommerce channel, resulting in increased web-based sales and improved operating margins. We continually seek to improve our ecommerce capabilities to drive sales and take advantage of the lower cost of this channel. Our showrooms and other direct marketing efforts work in concert to drive customer conversion in ecommerce. In addition, our shop in shops provide a low cost alternative to drive brand awareness and both in-store and ecommerce sales. 

Supply Chain and Sourcing
 
Our products are manufactured in facilities located in Los Angeles, CA, Fort Worth, TX and Jackson County, NC, as well as in facilities located abroad in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Foshan, China and in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We engage with local third parties for the manufacture of our products in each of those facilities. Lovesac does not own any of the manufacturing facilities where our products are assembled. We believe that our suppliers’ facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs. We believe that additional space will be available as needed to accommodate any needed expansion of our operations.
Seasonality
 
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales. A larger percentage of our sales occur in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which coincides with Cyber Monday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), the holiday season and our related promotional and marketing campaigns. Our fiscal 2019 quarters in sequential order equaled 16.1%, 20.0%, 25.1% and 38.7% of total sales respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
We own 19 U.S. federal trademark registrations, 38 foreign trademark registrations, a number of U.S. and foreign trademark applications and common law trademark rights. Our registered U.S. trademarks include registrations for the Lovesac®, Lovesoft®, Sactionals®, Durafoam®, SAC® and Designed For Life® trademarks. Our trademarks, if not renewed, are scheduled to expire between 2020 and 2028.
 
In order to maintain our U.S. trademark registrations, we must continue to use the marks in commerce on the goods and services identified in the registrations and must make required filings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at intervals specified by applicable statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in abandonment or cancellation of the registrations.
 
We have 16 issued U.S. utility patents and 21 issued foreign utility patents, that are scheduled to expire between 2022 and 2037. We have 6 pending U.S. utility patent applications, 36 pending foreign utility patent applications and 3 pending international patent applications. Our Sactional technology patents include our proprietary geometric modular system and segmented bi-coupling technology. We also have multiple patents pending and expect to file patent applications for future innovations.
 
Competition
 
Our business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our competition includes: furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online furniture retailers and marketplaces.

We believe our combination of proprietary products, brand strength, loyal customer base, omni-channel approach, technological platform, unique consumer experience, logistical advantages and seasoned management team allow us to compete effectively against and differentiate ourselves from the competition.
 
Employees
 
As of February 3, 2019, we employed a total of 257 full time and 333 part time employees, and we contracted with 6 independent contractors. All employees and contractors are subject to contractual agreements that specify, among other things, requirements for confidentiality, ownership of newly developed intellectual property and restrictions on working for competitors as well as other matters.
