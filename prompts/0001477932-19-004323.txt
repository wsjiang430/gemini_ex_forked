Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are "forward-looking statements." These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes," "project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse affect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

Target Market

Health and wellness is becoming a part of everyone's lives, and eating right is usually the first step. What we have done to test the market for a products like this, is to take a look at the types of consumer that would be looking for our solution. The number of diets trends in America continues to grow, and hemp is the perfect solution for many of them.

Global Industries Analyst Report (GIA), states that the global market for foods developed for individuals with allergies or intolerances is expected to grow to 24.8 billion by 2020. Food allergies and intolerances are a growing public health problem causing higher demand of products that meet special dietary requirements. The biggest concerns:


· | Wheat - Immune response to one or more proteins found in wheat, does not have to be gluten 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Lactose - Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities.
· | Dairy - Individuals with a dairy allergy are allergic to either one or both of the milk proteins, casein and whey. Milk allergies are more common in children and some people grow out of them. 
· | Gluten - Only 1% of Americans has celiac disease, but 1/3 of the population claim to be gluten sensitive, and is trying to live a gluten free lifestyle. 
· | Soy - An exact percentage of Americans dealing with a soy allergy is unknown, but it is one of the "Big 8" food allergies 
· | Nut Allergy - Hemp is a wonderful substitute for those with nut allergies

Hemp is not only attractive to those with food allergens; individuals who follow a strict diet for any reason will be extremely attracted to hemp. Some of the more popular lifestyle diets include:


· | Paleo - Based on Google trends, book sales, and website hits, the number of Americans following a paleo lifestyle is in the millions 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Vegetarianism - "Vegetarianism in America" study, published by Vegetarian Times (vegetariantimes.com), shows that 3.2 percent of U.S. adults, or 7.3 million people, follow a vegetarian-based diet
· | Veganism - the Vegetarian Times study shows that 0.5 percent or 1 million people, follow an animal free vegan diet 
· | No GMO - 80% of the food consumed by children in America today are genetically modified. The NO GMO tag is the fastest growing segment in health food 
· | Kosher - it is estimated that 21% of the 5.3 million Jewish Americans keep kosher. 


Hemp based foods can be consumed by anyone in these segments. In 2014, the Hemp Industries Association (HIA), a non-profit trade association, released final estimates of the size of the U.S. retail market for hemp products. The estimated total retail value of hemp products sold in the U.S. in 2014 was at least $620 million. More importantly, the total retail sales of hemp food and body care products in the United States is estimated at $200 million.

Everyone can consume our hemp-based foods, but it is never smart to market a product that way. In order to pinpoint our ideal consumer, we have used research done by IRI and SPINS. In this study they broke down this new category of health CPG consumers into several segments. Those categories called "True Believers", and "Enlightened Environmentalists" are the two main shopper segments for organic food. They make up 46% of organic food purchases. They each make up 9% of the shoppers, so 18% together.

True Believers: Their main concern is to keep a healthy body. They buy only organic, they try new things, are college educated, and have a median income of $65,000.
Enlightened Environmentalists: They care about the environment and buy products and live in a way that doesn't hurt the environment. They specifically shop at places that carry mostly organic and environmentally friendly products; most of them have graduate school degrees and average 57 years of age. They have a median income of $57,000.

By taking these two groups we can highlight some main characteristics of our target consumer:


· | Average Age: 35-57 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Education: College& Graduate School 
· | Income: $55,000-$70,000 
· | Where they shop: a mixture of online & Organic and Health based retail (Whole Foods)

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution Strategies

Marketing Plan

Growth Hacking: We utilize growth hacking techniques to launch our brand. We promote through all social media channels to build brand awareness for our initial products. The first of these attempts will be sending products to popular Bloggers, Vlogers, and social media celebrities, for promotion on their channels. These techniques cost very little, and are extremely effective for Internet businesses. We will also use Google AdWords to push the product through online advertisements and SEO.
Online Marketing: We tailor an online marketing campaign to attract the two market segments mentioned earlier in the target market segment. This position will assure that we are promoting to the most viable group of consumers.
Instagram: Our goal on IG for our brands is to build an obsessed fan base and an engaged community. Hemp education is a vital part of these channels, we will utilize this channel to show the “lifestyle” using our products as well as unique info on our products and drive traffic to the Ecommerce store.
Twitter: The Key to twitter is communication. This will be the key to success on this social channel. The best twitter accounts today are ones that do not broadcast to the consumer, but engage the consumer with interesting content in the form of:

- | Questions/Surveys 
--+--------------------
- | Brand related news 
- | Customer Service 
- | Company News 
- | Follower Engagement

Facebook: Facebook has gone from being a publishing channel for brands, to now a landing page of brand identity. We utilize Facebook as a cornerstone of our online identity. We will be careful about being "too promotional" and we will be aiming for content that people will share. To achieve this we will:

- | Plan Monthly Campaigns 
--+------------------------------------------------------
- | Find Creative way to use consumer generated content 
- | Invest In short catchy video content clips (Mini Ads)
- | Utilize Facebook Ads for major campaigns 


6

Social Contests: We will have regular Social Media Channel contests that span from our website to every single channel we have. These will range from, Photo contest, video contests, cooking contests, etc. These types of contests really boosts followership, sharing and all drive traffic directly back to the landing page. They are relatively cheap and the prizes we will give away consist of actual product, lifestyle related products, and company marketing materials.
Analysis and Execution: We will analyze all of the social media channels using the latest tools (e.g. Google Analytics).

Guerrilla Marketing: Once we have scaled, and doing business with the big box retailers, we will use more traditional marketing techniques including; in store promotions, trade shows, festival, and Brand Ambassador Programs. 
Consumer Outreach & Education: The most important factor in the marketing of our products will be consumer education on the benefits of hemp and CBD. 

Sales Plan

Retail Distribution: Our partnership with distributors across the country will give us a leg up on the competition. The ability to get our products into distributors having access to so many retail locations is a big win for our brands. We are currently focusing on the South, the South-East and the Mid-West, but we plan on moving towards the North-East and West in the near future.
Online Sales: Our website is extremely easy to use. We worked with our website designers to ensure that our marketplace is both beautiful and functional.
