Item 1. Business 
Overview
Cohen & Steers, Inc. (CNS), a Delaware corporation formed on March 17, 2004, is a global investment manager specializing in liquid real assets, including real estate securities, listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, as well as preferred securities and other income solutions. Headquartered in New York City, with offices in London, Hong Kong, and Tokyo, we serve institutional and individual investors around the world. 
CNS is the holding company for its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. (CSCM), Cohen & Steers Securities, LLC (CSS), Cohen & Steers Asia Limited (CSAL), Cohen & Steers UK Limited (CSUK) and Cohen & Steers Japan, LLC (CSJL). CNS and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company, we, us or our. 
Our revenue is derived from fees received from our clients, including fees for managing or subadvising client accounts; investment advisory, administration, distribution and service fees received from Company-sponsored open-end and closed-end funds; and fees for portfolio consulting and other services. Our fees are paid in arrears, based on contractually specified percentages of the value of the assets we manage and, in certain cases, investment performance. Our revenue fluctuates with changes in the total value of our assets under management, which may occur as a result of investment performance, addition or termination of client accounts, inflows or outflows from client accounts, market conditions, or foreign currency fluctuations and is recognized over the period that the assets are managed. 
At December 31, 2018, we managed $54.8 billion in assets—$25.7 billion in institutional accounts, $20.7 billion in open-end funds, and $8.4 billion in closed-end funds. Our assets under management decreased 11.7% from $62.1 billion at December 31, 2017 as a result of net outflows of $1.2 billion, market depreciation of $2.5 billion and distributions of $3.6 billion. At January 31, 2019, our assets under management increased 9.5% from December 31, 2018 to $60.0 billion as a result of net inflows of $427 million and market appreciation of $5.0 billion, partially offset by distributions of $200 million.
Investment Vehicles
We manage three types of investment vehicles: institutional accounts, open-end funds and closed-end funds. 
Institutional Accounts
Institutional accounts for which we serve as investment adviser represent portfolios of securities we manage for institutional clients. We manage the assets in each institutional account in accordance with the investment requirements of that client as set forth in such client’s investment management agreement and investment guidelines. The investment management agreements with our institutional account clients are generally terminable at any time. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investment advisory fees from our institutional accounts totaled approximately $100.3 million, $100.2 million and $92.2 million, respectively, and accounted for 29.4%, 29.8% and 29.6%, respectively, of our investment advisory and administration fee revenue.
Advisory assets, which represent accounts for which we have been appointed as the investment manager, are included in our institutional account assets. As investment adviser, we are responsible to oversee the daily operations and manage the assets in the account while adhering to the specified investment objectives. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $12.1 billion of our institutional account assets were in advisory accounts.
Subadvisory assets, which generally represent collective investment vehicles for which we have been appointed as a subadvisor by the investment manager of that investment vehicle, are included in our institutional account assets. As subadvisor, we are responsible for managing all or a portion of the vehicle's investments, while the investment adviser oversees our performance as subadvisor; the vehicle sponsor is responsible for decisions regarding the amount, timing and whether to pay distributions of income from the investment vehicle to its beneficial owners. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $13.6 billion of our institutional account assets were in subadvisory accounts.

Open-end Funds
The open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser offer and issue new shares continuously as assets are invested and redeem shares when assets are withdrawn. The share price for purchases and redemptions of shares of each of the open-end funds is determined by each fund’s net asset value, which is calculated at the end of each business day. The net asset value per share is the current value of a fund’s assets less liabilities, divided by the fund’s total shares outstanding.
The investment advisory fees that we receive from the open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser vary based on each fund’s investment strategy, fees charged by other comparable funds and the market in which the fund is offered. In addition, we receive a separate fee for providing administrative services to certain open-end funds at a rate that is designed to reimburse us for the cost of providing these services. The open-end funds pay us a monthly investment advisory fee and an administration fee, if applicable, based on a contractual fee rate applied to the fund’s average assets under management. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investment advisory and administration fees from open-end funds totaled approximately $163.6 million, $157.9 million and $143.5 million, respectively, and accounted for 48%, 47% and 46%, respectively, of our investment advisory and administration fee revenue.
Our investment advisory and administration agreements with the U.S. registered open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are generally terminable upon a vote of a majority of the fund’s board of directors on 60 days’ notice, and each investment advisory agreement, including the fees payable thereunder, is subject to annual approval by a majority of the directors of the fund’s board who are not "interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Investment Company Act), following the initial two-year term.
Closed-end Funds
The closed-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are registered investment companies that have issued a fixed number of shares through public offerings. These shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and cannot be redeemed by the fund’s shareholders. The trading price of the shares is determined by supply and demand in the marketplace, and, as a result, the shares may trade at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the fund.
The investment advisory fees that we receive from the closed-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser vary based on each fund’s investment strategy, fees charged by other comparable funds and prevailing market conditions at the time each closed-end fund initially offered its shares to the public. In addition, we receive a separate fee for providing administration services to eight of the nine closed-end funds at a rate that is designed to reimburse us for the cost of providing these services. The closed-end funds pay us a monthly investment advisory fee and an administration fee, if applicable, based on a contractual fee rate applied to the fund’s average assets under management. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, investment advisory and administration fees from closed-end funds totaled approximately $77.3 million, $78.7 million and $76.1 million, respectively, and accounted for 22.6%, 23.4% and 24.4%, respectively, of our investment advisory and administration fee revenue.
Our investment advisory agreements with each U.S. closed-end fund for which we serve as investment adviser are generally terminable upon a vote of a majority of the fund’s board of directors on 60 days’ notice and are subject to annual approval by a majority of the directors of the fund’s board who are not "interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act, following the initial two-year term.
Portfolio Consulting and Other Services
We maintain two proprietary indexes, Cohen & Steers Realty Majors Index (RMP) and Cohen & Steers Global Realty Majors Index (GRM). RMP is the basis for the iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF sponsored by BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. GRM is the basis for Cohen & Steers Global Realty Majors ETF sponsored by ALPS Fund Services, Inc. and iShares Global Real Estate Index ETF sponsored by BlackRock Asset Management Canada Limited. We earn a licensing fee based on a percentage of the funds’ assets for the use of our indexes, which were approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management.
We also provide services in connection with model-based strategies accounts. We provide model portfolios of securities that fulfill the investment objective of a specified strategy on a regular basis. As of December 31, 2018, we provided such services to accounts with aggregate assets of $3.0 billion. While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management.

In addition, we provide several services in connection with assets held by unit investment trusts (UITs). A UIT is a registered investment company that holds a portfolio of securities that generally does not change during the life of the UIT (generally two to five years) except that the sponsor of the UIT may sell portfolio securities under certain narrowly defined circumstances. As a portfolio consultant to a number of UITs, we construct a portfolio of securities that we believe is well suited to satisfy the investment objective of the UIT. We also provide ongoing portfolio monitoring services and provide a license to certain firms to use our name in connection with certain of their investment products. At December 31, 2018, we provided such portfolio consulting services to UITs with aggregate assets of approximately $615 million. While we receive a fee on these assets, they are not included in our reported assets under management.
Our fee schedules for these services vary based on the type of services.
Our Investment Strategies
Each of our investment strategies is overseen by a specialist team, each of which is led by a portfolio manager, or a team of portfolio managers, supported by dedicated analysts. These personnel are located in our New York, London and Hong Kong offices. Each team executes fundamentally driven, actively managed investment strategies and each has a unique and well-defined process that includes top-down macroeconomic and bottom-up fundamental research and portfolio management elements. These teams are subject to multiple levels of oversight and support from our President and Chief Investment Officer, our Chief Administrative Officer-Investments, our Investment Risk Committee, our Investment Operating Committee and our Legal and Compliance Department. Some of our strategies may involve multiple asset classes and are overseen by investment committees led by senior portfolio managers of our specialist teams.
Below is a summary of our core investment strategies:
Real Assets Multi-Strategy invests in a diversified multi-strategy portfolio of listed companies and securities that generally own or are backed by tangible real assets, including real estate securities, global listed infrastructure, commodities and natural resource equities, with the objective of achieving attractive total returns over the long term, while providing diversification and maximizing the potential for real returns in periods of rising inflation and rising interest rates.
U.S. and Global Real Estate Securities invests in a portfolio of common stocks and other securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) and similar REIT-like entities. This strategy draws on the expertise of our integrated global real estate securities investment team. The investment objective is total return with a balance of capital appreciation and income.
Global Listed Infrastructure invests in a diversified portfolio of U.S. and non-U.S. securities issued by infrastructure companies such as utilities, pipelines, toll roads, airports, railroads, marine ports and communications companies located in developed markets with opportunistic allocations to emerging markets. The investment objective is total return with a balance of capital appreciation and income.
MLPs and Midstream Energy invests in a diversified portfolio of energy-related master limited partnerships (MLPs) and securities of companies that derive at least 50% of their revenues or operating income from the exploration, production, gathering, transportation, processing, storage, refining, distribution or marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined petroleum products, coal or and other energy resources. The investment objective is total return with a balance of capital appreciation and income.
Global Natural Resource Equities invests in companies involved in the production, extraction, or processing of commodities and natural resources. Specifically, the strategy invests in energy producers, metals and mining companies and agriculture-based businesses. The investment objective is total return.
Commodities invests in a diversified portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts and other commodity-related financial derivative instruments. We take a fundamental, research-driven approach to commodities management, while seeking alpha through active trade implementation. The investment objective is total return.
Preferred Securities invests in a diversified portfolio of preferred and debt securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The preferred securities are issued by banks, insurance companies, REITs and other diversified financial institutions as well as utility, energy, pipeline and telecommunications companies. We employ a unified investment process that underlies our traditional total return preferred securities strategy as well as the lower duration capital preservation strategies.

In addition, we offer variations on these strategies that may combine multiple strategies in a single portfolio. Individual portfolios may be customized to comply with client-specific guidelines, benchmarks or risk profiles. Certain portfolios may employ leverage.
Our Distribution Network
Our distribution network encompasses the major channels in the asset management industry, including large brokerage firms, registered investment advisers, institutional investors and retirement recordkeepers. The U.S. registered open-end funds for which we serve as investment adviser are available for purchase with and without commissions through full service and discount broker-dealers as well as the significant networks serving financial advisers. Our institutional account clients include corporate and public defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, endowment funds and foundations, insurance companies and other financial institutions that access our investment management services directly, through consultants or through other intermediaries.
Competition
We compete with a large number of global and U.S. investment managers, commercial banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many competing firms are parts of larger financial services companies and attract business through numerous channels, including retail banking, investment banking and underwriting contacts, insurance agencies and broker-dealers.
Our direct competitors in wealth management are other fund and exchange-traded-fund (ETF) sponsors, including large nationally recognized investment management firms that have more diverse product offerings and smaller boutique firms that specialize in particular asset classes. We also compete against managers that manage separate-account portfolios for high net worth clients. In the institutional channel, we compete against a number of investment managers offering similar products and services, from boutique establishments to major commercial and investment banks.
Performance, price and brand are our principal sources of competition. Prospective clients will typically base their decisions to invest, or continue to invest, with us on our ability to generate returns in excess of a benchmark and the cost of doing so. We are evaluated based on our performance and our fees relative to our competitors. In addition, individual fund shareholders may also base their decision on the ability to access the funds we manage through a particular distribution channel.
As interest in real assets increases, we may face increased competition from other managers that are competing for the same client base that we target and serve. Financial intermediaries that offer our products to their clients may also offer competing products. Many of our competitors have greater brand name recognition and more extensive client bases than we do, which could be to our disadvantage. In addition, our larger competitors have more resources and may have more capacity to expand their product offerings and distribution channels and capture market share through ongoing business relationships and extensive marketing efforts. However, compared to our larger competitors, we may be able to grow our business at a faster rate from a relatively smaller asset base and shift resources in response to changing market conditions more quickly.
Regulation
We are subject to regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as applicable laws in the other jurisdictions in which we do business or offer our products and services. Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of engagement in certain activities, reputational harm and loss of clients, suspension of personnel or revocation of their regulatory licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser and/or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions and penalties.

Such requirements may limit our ability to withdraw capital from CSUK. CSUK is also subject to certain pan-European regulations, including MiFID II, the Capital Requirements Directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). MiFID II and MiFIR regulate the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area and the Capital Requirements Directive regulates capital requirements. AIFMD regulates the management, administration and marketing of alternative investment funds domiciled in or marketed within the European Union and establishes a regime for the cross-border marketing of those funds.
CSAL, our Hong Kong-based subsidiary, is a registered investment adviser with the SEC and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (the SFC) and is an approved investment manager with the CSSF and the IFSRA.

CSAL and its employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC.
In their capacity as U.S. registered investment advisers, CSCM, CSUK and CSAL are subject to the rules and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Advisers Act). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including recordkeeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. In addition, our subsidiaries that serve as investment adviser or subadvisor to U.S. registered funds are subject to the Investment Company Act, which imposes additional governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations.

CSS is subject to regulations governing, among other things, sales practices, capital structure and recordkeeping. CSS is also subject to the SEC’s net capital rule, which specifies minimum net capital levels for registered broker-dealers and is designed to enforce minimum standards for the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers. Under certain circumstances, this rule may limit our ability to withdraw capital and receive dividends from CSS. 
Because of the global and integrated nature of our business, regulation applicable to an affiliate in one jurisdiction may affect the operation of affiliates in others or require compliance at a group level.
