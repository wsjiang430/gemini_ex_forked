Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a United States domiciled minerals exploration and development company with a focus on developing mines from mineral deposits principally located in the United States. We seek to support American supply chain independence by finding and delivering the critical metals necessary for electrification of the economy, with a focus on copper. We believe the United States is significantly underexplored and has the potential to yield major new discoveries of these metals.
We are committed to the sustainable development of our projects by embedding Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) criteria in our decision-making framework from the earliest stages of project exploration and development. We are committed to building upon our team’s strong ESG track record, including at Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (“Ivanhoe Mines”), founded by Robert Friedland, our founder and Executive Chairman, leveraging best practices and seeking to establish Ivanhoe Electric as an ESG leader in the mining sector. Key considerations that will influence our decision making include, but are not limited to, using clean and renewable energy in our future mining operations, optimizing and minimizing our water resource utilization, minimizing our environmental footprint, ensuring workforce diversity and hiring from local communities, following best practices to meet the highest health, safety and environmental standards as well as protecting local cultural heritage and biodiversity. Most importantly, our products play a critical ESG role by supporting electrification and enabling the clean energy transition.

Our United States Mineral Projects
Material and Key Mineral Projects
Our two material mineral projects are the Santa Cruz Project in Arizona and the Tintic Project in Utah. Santa Cruz is a copper project situated in a prolific mining region that hosts some of the largest copper mines in the United States. Tintic is an exploration project located in a historically significant silver producing district that also produced significant amounts of copper and gold. We believe the Tintic district has the potential to host a world-class porphyry copper-gold deposit. We have the option to acquire 100% of the mineral rights constituting the Santa Cruz and Tintic projects and we own or have option agreements in place to own the majority of the surface land at our Tintic Project.
Our other key mineral projects are the Hog Heaven Copper-Silver-Gold Project (“Hog Heaven”), located in Montana, and the Sama Nickel-Copper-Palladium Project, located in the Ivory Coast, in which we have both direct and indirect interests.
We use several criteria to distinguish between our material properties, key properties and exploration projects. In particular, we have evaluated each property using the following criteria (without ranking the criteria in any particular order): stage of development of the mineral property; level of ownership of the mineral property and/or level of ownership we have the right to obtain in the future; size and quality of any mineral reserve or mineral resource; prospectivity of each mineral property based on exploration results obtained; current and proposed programs of exploration; current and/or expected proposed expenditure and financing needs for each mineral property; and historical activities and expenditures incurred.

Typhoon™ and Computational Geosciences
In addition to our portfolio of material and key mineral projects, we own through a wholly-owned subsidiary patents to a proprietary exploration technology known as Typhoon™. When we reference “our” Typhoon™ technology, we mean the technology that is owned by our wholly-owned subsidiary Geo27, Inc. (“Geo27”). We also own a controlling interest in a data inversion business, Computational Geosciences Inc. (“CGI”). CGI was founded in 2010 to commercialize innovative technology developed at the University of British Columbia, Canada to improve and enhance mineral exploration. We also are the exclusive worldwide licensee of certain technology from I-Pulse Inc. (“I-Pulse”). I-Pulse is the parent of our predecessor company, High Power Exploration Inc. (“HPX”).
The Typhoon™ technology allows us to cost effectively and efficiently generate geophysical images of large-scale mineral deposits to depths of one and a half kilometers or more. The CGI software technology consists of sophisticated codes to process geophysical data and build 3D subsurface images that could indicate the presence of various metals and minerals.
We own the issued patents shown below. These patents cover certain aspects of our Typhoon™ technology. The actual protection afforded by these patents varies depending on the scope of coverage of each individual patent as well as the availability of legal remedies in each jurisdiction.

Typhoon™ can and has been used to successfully accelerate and de-risk the exploration process enabling a higher frequency of resource discovery and lowering total exploration costs. Typhoon™ has proven to be an important exploration tool during its deployment at Santa Cruz and Tintic. In July 2022, we completed a 26.5 km2 (6,500-acre) Typhoon™ 3D induced polarization and resistivity geophysical survey at Santa Cruz which identified multiple large-scale anomalies. These anomalies may indicate the potential to expand the currently known copper oxide and sulfide mineralization at Santa Cruz. On November 8, 2022, we announced the discovery of the East Ridge oxide copper zone at Santa Cruz, which was related to one of the anomalies identified by Typhoon™ and on which we conducted exploration drilling following the survey. On November 29, 2022, we announced the discovery of a new zone of sulfide mineralization called the Far Southwest Anomaly which was drill tested below 1,000 meters of overlying basin-fill gravel and conglomerates. Typhoon™ has also been utilized at many of our other projects. Current and historical deployment of Typhoon™ by us, HPX and third-party clients is shown on the map below.
We also hold a worldwide, exclusive license to certain legacy technology from I-Pulse to, among other things, use, develop, sell and commercialize products and services incorporating such legacy technology within the field of geological surveying for mineral exploration. The license from I-Pulse is perpetual (subject to the expiration of the patents owned by I-Pulse underlying a portion of the I-Pulse technology). The license is also terminable by us on 120 days' written notice to I-Pulse, and by either party only upon material breach of the license agreement under which the I-Pulse license was granted or insolvency of the other party

History
We were incorporated in Delaware on July 14, 2020, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of HPX.
On April 30, 2021, HPX completed a reorganization whereby HPX contributed (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPX’s subsidiaries, other than those holding direct or indirect interests in its Nimba Iron Ore Project in Guinea; (ii) certain property, plant and equipment; and (iii) certain financial assets, in exchange for shares of our common stock. 
Table of Contents

HPX then distributed the shares of our common stock to HPX stockholders by way of a dividend, with each HPX stockholder receiving one share of our common stock for each HPX share of common stock then held by the stockholder.
On April 30, 2021, we also entered into an intellectual property assignment and novation agreement with HPX, I-Pulse, and several subsidiary companies by which the rights to certain technology and patent license agreements previously held by HPX or a subsidiary, as licensee, were assigned to us. 
On June 30, 2022, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in which we issued and sold 14,388,000 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $11.75 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $169.1 million. BMO Capital Markets Corp. and Jefferies LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the IPO and as representatives of the underwriters.
Ma’aden Transaction
On January 11, 2023, the Company entered into a binding Heads of Terms (the “Agreement”) with Saudi Arabian Mining Company Ma’aden (“Ma’aden”), the largest multi-commodity mining and metals company in the Middle East. The Agreement provides the binding framework of key terms for a strategic investment by Ma’aden of an aggregate of $126.4 million in newly issued shares of common stock of the Company (the “Shares”) and the concurrent establishment of a 50/50 exploration joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia described below (the “Joint Venture”).
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, we will agree to issue and sell to Ma’aden (directly or to a subsidiary) approximately 10.2 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $12.38 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $126.4 million in a private placement. We will contribute $66.4 million of the proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Shares to fund the Joint Venture, including the purchase of three new Typhoon™ machines, and will retain $60 million of the gross proceeds to advance our United States mineral projects, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes.
After the issuance and sale of the Shares, Ma’aden will hold 9.9% of our common stock. We also will grant Ma’aden a right to purchase additional shares of common stock to maintain its 9.9% stock ownership position in the event of any issuances of common stock by us in the future, including stock issued as a result of (i) issuances to employees pursuant to any existing or future equity incentive plan, agreement or arrangement approved by the Board of Directors; (ii) the exercise or vesting of incentive securities; or (iii) shares issued as acquisition consideration. Ma’aden may exercise this right (the “top-up right”) upon the first occurrence after such dilution event in which we issue shares (or securities convertible into shares) for cash as part of an equity financing transaction. In the event that Ma’aden does not exercise its top-up right, the ownership threshold for purposes of the top-up right will be reduced to its ownership level after giving effect to the dilutive issuance. The top-up right will expire on the earlier of (i) five years from the date of completion of Ma’aden’s investment in us (the “Initial Period”), but only if within such five-year period Ma’aden has (a) failed on two separate occurrences to exercise in full its top-up rights, or (b) Ma’aden has sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of any Shares (other than to an affiliate or to the Public Investment Fund of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the “PIF”)); (ii) the first day following the Initial Period on which Ma’aden sells, transfers or otherwise disposes of any of our shares of common stock (other than to an affiliate or to the PIF); and (iii) three years after the Initial Period.
We will also provide Ma’aden with the right to nominate one director to our Board of Directors for so long as Ma’aden owns at least 8% of the outstanding shares of common stock, bringing our board size to nine. Ma’aden will also agree to a five-year standstill preventing it from increasing its share ownership above 19.9% without the approval of the Board of Directors. The standstill will automatically be released in order for Ma’aden and its affiliates to make a competing offer if we enter into any agreement with a third party providing for a transaction that would result in a third party beneficially owning more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Ma’aden will agree not to dispose of any of its Shares (except in open market, non-pre-arranged stock exchange transactions), if, as a result of such disposition, the purchaser of such shares would become the owner of greater than 9.9% of our common stock and is either a mining company or state-owned enterprise, other than the PIF.
Ma’aden will also agree for a five-year period to vote in favor of certain matters for so long as it continues to have a right to nominate a director, including to vote in favor of the election of all of our director nominees and to vote in favor of all matters on which our stockholders are entitled to vote that have been approved by a majority of the independent directors of the Board of Directors. We have also agreed that we will enter into a registration rights agreement with Ma’aden related to a future registration of the Shares.
Saudi Arabian Exploration Joint Venture
The Agreement provides that we will establish a new Saudi exploration Joint Venture with Ma’aden, which will be owned 50/50 and have an initial term of five years, which may be extended up to 10 years upon mutual agreement of the 
Table of Contents

parties. The Joint Venture will be conducted through a newly established limited liability company established under Saudi law (“Saudi JVCo”). Ma’aden will make available approximately 48,500 km2 of land under an exploration license (or license application) within Saudi Arabia for exploration by the Joint Venture. We will contribute $66.4 million of the proceeds from the sale of the Shares to fund Saudi JVCo and the Joint Venture, and will provide Saudi JVCo with a royalty-free license to use Typhoon™ within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the purpose of mineral exploration. The license will remain exclusive to the Joint Venture in Saudi Arabia and effective during the term of the Joint Venture. Saudi JVCo will purchase three new generation Typhoon™ units from the Company’s former parent, I-Pulse, the first of which is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2024, for an aggregate contract price not to exceed $13 million. Prior to the delivery of new Typhoon™ units, we will make available an existing Typhoon™ unit to commence surveying in Saudi Arabia according to the terms of the Agreement. The Joint Venture will also enter into a services agreement with CGI, pursuant to which CGI will be responsible for the supply of the services for the analysis of data and processing of the full spectrum of geophysical datasets in 3D produced by the Typhoon™ systems.
The Joint Venture will be governed by a board of directors and Technical Committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each company. The Technical Committee will supervise the exploration activities of the Joint Venture including an initial “land identification stage” where the land Ma’aden is making available will be reviewed and reduced to the most prospective areas for Typhoon deployment. This stage will be followed by generative exploration and drilling stages aimed at identifying mineral resources of an economically viable scale. We will be the operator during the exploration phase. Ma’aden will assume operatorship if an economically viable deposit is found and is designated by the Joint Venture for further development. We will also provide training and development to an agreed number of employees of the Joint Venture, on mineral exploration, geology, and the operation of the Typhoon™ units. The Joint Venture will not be terminable, other than upon the occurrence of an event of default, by either party until the end of the exploration phase.
The Agreement is a framework agreement that sets out the binding parameters of the transactions described above. The Agreement will be replaced by definitive agreements which will include the key terms set out in the Agreement, which only may be changed if required to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements, for the establishment of the Joint Venture entity, or if required to meet the technical specifications and needs for the use of Typhoon™ in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Agreement will terminate automatically on the earliest to occur of the following: (i) the date on which the definitive agreements are executed by the parties or their respective affiliates; (ii) notwithstanding negotiation by the parties in good faith, in the event the parties have not been able to reach agreement on the definitive agreement, three months after the execution of the Agreement; and (iii) the bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, amalgamation, reconstruction of either party or any analogous proceeding relating to either party. The definitive agreements are expected to be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2023.
In addition to being subject to further confirmatory due diligence by each party and the execution of definitive agreements, the closing of the transactions is subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions, including filing of a supplemental listing application with the NYSE American LLC (“NYSE American”), Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) approval and other customary regulatory approvals, including, if applicable, the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods and requests for information (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and, if required, the parties receiving written confirmation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States that it has completed its review or, if applicable, investigation and determination that there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
We cannot assure you as to (i) the timing of entering into definitive agreements, including the potential failure to enter into definitive agreements at all; (ii) our and Ma’aden’s ability to satisfy the conditions to the proposed transactions on the anticipated timeline or at all; (iii) the satisfaction of conditions, including applicable regulatory clearances and approvals; (iv) that the Joint Venture, if established, will be successful in its exploration activities and fail to identify any economically viable mineral deposits; or (v) our ability to monetize its interest in an economically viable mineral deposit even if one is identified.
Key Business Highlights
We have a portfolio of highly prospective mineral projects, predominantly focused on copper and other metals needed for the clean energy transition, assembled by Robert Friedland and his team over the past decade.
Our two material mineral projects are Santa Cruz and Tintic, situated in the high-quality copper producing jurisdictions of Arizona and Utah, respectively. According to the Fraser Institute’s Annual Survey of Mining Companies, Utah and Arizona rank as some of the most attractive copper mining investment jurisdictions compared to other major copper mining jurisdictions around the world.

Santa Cruz
Santa Cruz is located in a prolific mining district in Arizona, with numerous major copper mines in close proximity. The Santa Cruz project is situated in the Ajo-Globe-Miami structural corridor in Arizona, which we estimate contains significant copper resources. Since 1980, Arizona has produced over 35 Mt of copper, which is approximately 65% of total United States production.
Santa Cruz was discovered in the 1970s, but was undeveloped due to market conditions as well as fragmented title and ownership. After more than seven years of negotiations, we acquired an option to acquire 100% of the mineral rights constituting Santa Cruz and entered into agreements to acquire further surface rights and mineral titles. In order to acquire the principal mineral titles under option from their owner, we will be required to spend an aggregate of $27,870,500 in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of the owner by August 16, 2024. As of December 31, 2022, we had made payments totaling $11,620,500 under the option. See “Business — Material and Key Mineral Projects — Santa Cruz Project, Arizona, USA”.
In 2021, we entered into an agreement with Central Arizona Resources Ltd. (“CAR”), a private company, and acquired the option CAR held over the mineral title described below owned by DRHE, a private company. CAR was also party to a surface use agreement (“SUA”) with Legends Property, LLC (“Legends”), which owns the majority of the surface rights associated with the Santa Cruz Project. We also acquired this surface rights access agreement from CAR.
The agreement with DRHE provides that we (by way of assignment from CAR) have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire 100% of the mineral title in the fee simple mineral estate, 39 Federal unpatented mining claims, and three small, approximately 10 acre surface parcels, by paying $27,870,500 in cash or in shares of our common stock at the election of DRHE over the course of three years. As of December 31, 2022, we paid $11,620,500 to DRHE and $16,250,000 remains to be paid to DRHE by 2024.
The Santa Cruz Project is located in Pinal County, Arizona, to the west of Casa Grande and approximately a one-hour drive south of Phoenix. The Santa Cruz Project encompasses approximately 47.3 km2 of land.

(1)The Mineral Resources in this Estimate were independently prepared, including estimation and classification, by Nordmin Engineering Ltd. and in accordance with the definitions for Mineral Resources in S-K 1300. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. This estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. Verification included multiple site visits to inspect drilling, logging, density measurement procedures and sampling procedures, and a review of the control sample results used to assess laboratory assay quality. In addition, a random selection of the drill hole database results was compared with the original records. The Mineral Resources in this estimate for the Santa Cruz, East Ridge, and Texaco Deposits used Datamine Studio RMTM software to create the block models. The Mineral Resources are current to December 31, 2022. Underground-constrained Mineral Resources for the Santa Cruz Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.70% total copper, Texaco Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.80% total copper and East Ridge Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.90% total copper. The cut-off grade reflects total operating costs to define reasonable prospects for eventual economic extracted by conventional underground mining methods with a maximum production rate of 15,000 tonnes/day. All material within mineable shape-optimized wireframes has been included in the Mineral Resource. Underground mineable shape optimization parameters include a long-term copper price of $3.70/lb, process recovery of 94%, direct mining costs between $24.50-$40.00/processed tonne reflecting various mining method costs (long hole or room and pillar), mining general and administration cost of $4.00/tonne processed, onsite processing and SX/EW costs between $13.40-$14.47/tonne processed, offsite costs between $3.29 – $4.67/tonne processed, along with variable royalties between 5.00-6.96% NSR and a mining recovery of 100%. Specific Gravity was applied using weighted averages by Deposit Sub-Domain. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates, and totals may not add correctly. Excludes unclassified mineralization located along edges of the Santa Cruz, East Ridge, and Texaco Deposits where drill density is poor. Report from within a mineralization envelope accounting for mineral continuity. Total soluble copper means the addition of sequential acid soluble copper and sequential cyanide soluble copper assays. Total soluble copper is not reported for the Primary Domain.
(2)Acid soluble Cu and cyanide soluble Cu are not reported for the Primary Domain.
Based on this resource estimate, we believe that Santa Cruz is currently the second largest undeveloped copper deposit, by tonnes, located in the continental United States with what we believe to be considerable potential to expand the resources. Drilling is ongoing and will continue through 2023. Currently, the Santa Cruz drill program consists of six diamond drill rigs. Drill core samples are being processed at laboratories in Arizona and Vancouver.
The resource at the Santa Cruz Deposit reflects a 0.70% total copper cut-off, while the resources at East Ridge and Texaco reflect a 0.90% and 0.80% total copper cut-off, respectively versus the 0.39% total copper cut-off used in the 2021 resource estimate. At these higher cut-off grades, the overall project-wide contained copper in Indicated Mineral Resources increased by 11% compared to the previous resource estimate. Importantly, project-wide contained copper in Indicated Mineral Resources, excluding primary sulfide mineralization, increased by 86%. This higher grade material tends to be in the soluble categories, potentially allowing for lower operating costs, lower energy usage, and lower water-consuming processing methods. One development option is to integrate this large, high-grade, soluble copper resource with renewable energy power sources, such as solar power, to develop a modern, low footprint, sustainable copper-producing industrial complex. We also intend to evaluate opportunities to utilize VRB-ESS® onsite for potential storage of sustainably generated power.

Tintic
The Tintic exploration area covers approximately 65 km2 of private patented claims, unpatented claims, state leases, and prospecting permits consolidated into a contiguous land package. The location of the Tintic Project benefits from supportive infrastructure and access to a skilled labor workforce. The Tintic Project is located near the City of Eureka, approximately 95 km south of Salt Lake City, and can be accessed from U.S. Highway 6, approximately 30 km west of the Interstate 15 junction. It is conveniently crossed by many historical mine roads and railroad grades, which provide access to most of the property.
The Tintic Mining District (the “Tintic District”) was the third-largest silver mining district in the United States based on past production, remaining resources, and past production plus remaining resources. The Tintic District produced significant amounts of copper and gold from multiple operating mines from 1871 through to 1983, with mining peaking in the 1920s. Total historical production from the Main and Southwest Tintic District is estimated at 2.18 Moz gold, 209 Moz silver, 116 kt copper, 589 kt lead and 63 kt zinc, from both surface and underground sources.
With significant mining activity in the Tintic District concluding in 1983, companies owned by Mr. Spenst Hansen were able to consolidate a significant package of historic mining claims with supporting production and drill data. Mr. Hansen is the principal vendor of Tintic-related mining claims to Ivanhoe Electric.
 We have entered into purchase and sale agreements with five different vendor groups owning mineral titles at the Tintic Project. Under these purchase agreements, payment of the purchase price is deferred and no title will transfer until the purchase price has been paid in full. Until such time, the mineral titles are held with a third party escrow agent. We are required to pay a total of $30,800,000 to acquire all of these titles with all payments to be made by the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid a total of $27,275,000 and have a total of $3,525,000 remaining to pay by the end of 2023. Over a two-year period following the first acquisition of these mining claims, we scanned over 8,700 maps and digitized over 500 maps to construct a comprehensive geological model to enhance our Tintic exploration program.
Tintic Historic and Target Model
The Tintic District lies 60 km south of Rio Tinto’s Bingham Canyon porphyry copper-gold mine, which has been in operation since 1906 and has produced over 19 million tonnes of copper and 28 million ounces of gold, making it one of the most productive copper-gold mines in the world. The intrusive complex at Tintic is similar in age to the Bingham Canyon porphyry deposit. Mineralization at Tintic is hosted in the same Paleozoic sedimentary host rocks as Bingham, and the east-west trending intrusive belt in which Tintic occurs is parallel to, and coeval with, the Bingham-Uinta intrusive belt. The close similarities in geological setting between Tintic and Bingham Canyon highlight what we believe is the porphyry potential at Tintic.
We believe the 72 km2 Typhoon™ survey that we conducted at Tintic in 2018 and 2019 is one of the largest 3D Induced Polarization (“IP”) surveys ever completed. The survey identified three potential porphyry copper targets (Rabbits’ 
Table of Contents

Foot, Sunbeam and Deep Mammoth), which appear to us to have similar characteristics to the mineralized porphyry at the Bingham Canyon mine. These targets are permitted for drilling in 2023 through our subsidiary, Tintic Copper & Gold Inc. (“TC&G”) which holds 100% of these permits.
In addition to testing the porphyry targets, we intend to undertake further drilling at Tintic to extend historically mined deposits beyond their known limits. Historical miners ceased mining once they encountered the water table due to a lack of pumping technology available at the time. We believe that mineralization continues to depth below the water table and that significant potential exists to discover additional mineralized material. As a preliminary step, in September 2022, we re-sampled six sections from historic drill holes. The presence of enargite and pyrite in three of these holes immediately below both the Mammoth “pipe” and water table indicates a continuation of the oxidized high sulfidation mineralization mined historically into unoxidized sulfide-rich mineralization. The appearance of chalcocite in one hole shows potential for hypogene copper replacing pyrite at higher temperatures within replacement-style mineralization and may reflect increasing proximity to the source porphyry copper system. Initial drilling commenced in late November 2022 to test porphyry targets and will continue through 2023.
Focused on discovering, identifying, and developing mineral projects in the United States in order to better secure domestic access to the metals needed for the clean energy transition
We search globally for potential world-class mineral deposits of critical metals, with a predominant focus on exploration and development of these assets within the United States. We have assembled a portfolio of highly prospective assets, headlined by our two material mineral projects, Santa Cruz in Arizona and Tintic in Utah.
Access to critical metals from domestic sources has become a strategic focus to enhance United States supply chain security. As global demand for critical metals strengthens, we believe securing additional sources of supply for these commodities will grow in importance for the United States.
Proprietary cutting-edge TyphoonTM hardware and CGI software de-risk mineral project exploration by lowering costs and increasing the depth, breadth and accuracy of surveys
Typhoon™ is the brand name for our proprietary electrical geophysical surveying transmitter, which can detect the presence of sulfide minerals containing copper, nickel, gold and silver, as well as water and oil (although the Company does not hold any rights to water and oil exploration, as I-Pulse holds an exclusive Typhoon™ license for those commodities). The technology was developed by I-Pulse to unlock exploration in areas where potential deposits are hidden by cover, where target depths exceed the range of conventional geophysical surveying systems, or where the scale and topography of an exploration target area prevents efficient and cost-effective conventional work. Typhoon™ allows us to potentially discover deposits otherwise thought to be undetectable through conventional survey methods and technology.
Typhoon™ in Resource Exploration
We believe the following specifications differentiate Typhoon™ from conventional geophysical systems:
•high current that is adjustable according to the depth and scale of the exploration target;
•high voltages that are also adjustable to overcome near-surface resistance;
•the ability to transmit both electromagnetic and direct current signals;
Table of Contents

•extremely clean signal, which yields a high signal to noise ratio in recorded data;
•the ability to synchronize with multiple types of data receivers, so that the user can choose the receiver system most appropriate for the exploration environment; and
•three deployment configurations, from a large containerized system to a smaller lightweight system that is helicopter portable.
We currently have three Typhoon™ units, which allow us to evaluate multiple prospects at any given time. Saudi JVCo will also order three new Typhoon™ units following establishment of the Joint Venture and which are expected to be delivered to Saudi JVCo in the first half of 2024. We have also ordered the construction of a further six additional Typhoon™ machines and anticipate that the first will be delivered to us in the second half of 2024 following delivery of the new units for Saudi JVCo.
The data processing and artificial intelligence software developed by our subsidiary CGI complements our Typhoon™ technology and represents the only software product that can process the full spectrum of geophysical data produced by Typhoon™ efficiently.
Typhoon™ at Tintic
Typhoon™ completed a 72 km2 fully 3D IP survey of Tintic, with effective penetration depths averaging over 1.5 km. Three potential porphyry copper-gold targets have been identified and were permitted for drilling in 2022 and 2023 through our subsidiary, TC&G which holds 100% of these permits as shown in the first image below. The second image below shows an east-west cross section from Mammoth to Northern Spy that shows the Typhoon™ resistivity and chargeability features that define the Mammoth Porphyry target at depth in the heart of the Main Tintic District.

Typhoon™ at Santa Cruz
In July 2022, we completed a 26.5 km2 (6,500-acre) Typhoon™ 3D induced polarization and resistivity geophysical survey at the Santa Cruz Copper Project. The survey identified multiple large-scale anomalies, which may indicate the potential to expand the currently known copper oxide and sulfide mineralization at Santa Cruz. On November 8, 2022 we announced the discovery of the East Ridge oxide copper zone at the Santa Cruz Copper Project, which was one of the anomalies identified by Typhoon™ and on which we conducted exploration drilling following the survey.
Management track record of success: Robert Friedland-led management team has a compelling track record for discovery and development with an emphasis of ESG principles
Robert Friedland
We were founded by Robert Friedland, a serial entrepreneurial explorer, technology innovator and company builder. He has successfully developed a series of public and private companies which have been at the forefront of some of the 
Table of Contents

world’s most notable mineral discoveries and mine developments including Fort Knox in Alaska, Voisey’s Bay in Canada, Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, Platreef in South Africa and Kamoa- Kakula in the DRC.
Mr. Friedland is currently the Executive Co-Chairman of Ivanhoe Mines, which operates the ultra-high-grade Kamoa-Kakula copper mine. As of January 30, 2023, Wood Mackenzie projects Kamoa Kakula to be the world’s fourth largest copper mine by 2025 once its Phase 3 expansion is completed.
In 1994, Mr. Friedland founded Indochina Goldfields Ltd., now known as Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd., which operates the Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia. Based on estimates prepared by Turquoise Hill Resources, Oyu Tolgoi has the potential to operate for approximately 100 years from five known deposits.
Mr. Friedland and members of his team have discovered a number of other valuable projects prior to the creation of Ivanhoe Electric.
•Platreef Project: This major greenfield discovery of platinum-group metals, nickel, copper and gold is located in South Africa and owned by Ivanhoe Mines. At its final projected production rate of 12 Mtpa, Platreef would be positioned among the largest primary nickel and platinum-group metals mines in the world.
•Voisey’s Bay: Mr. Friedland was a co-founding principal of Diamond Fields Resources, which discovered Voisey’s Bay, a Canadian nickel deposit, in 1993. As Co-Chairman of Diamond Fields Resources, Mr. Friedland was in charge of financing and investor strategy and led the negotiations for the sale of the company to INCO Mining Corp. for C$4.3 billion in 1996.
•Fort Knox: Fort Knox is an Alaskan gold deposit discovered by Mr. Friedland and his team in 1992 and subsequently sold to Amax Gold Inc. for $152 million. The asset is currently owned by Kinross Gold Corporation and has been in production since 1997.
Robert Friedland Led Discoveries
Longstanding Leadership Commitment to ESG Principles
The leadership team at Ivanhoe Electric has a proven track record of implementing ESG-focused policies and strategies pertaining to community engagement, diversity, safety, environmental standards and clean energy. This has been a focus of Robert Friedland from his work in other ventures, including at Ivanhoe Mines.
The Ivanhoe Electric management team has a similar commitment to ESG principles and expects to adopt much of the same philosophy and approach to ESG as it continues to develop the Company’s assets and ultimately begin production.

Robert Friedland generates project opportunities and a pipeline of projects that underpin our future growth potential
Over the past four decades, Mr. Friedland has established a highly successful track record of exploration and mine developments as well as a vast network of relationships in the global metals and mining sector. Both are key reasons why Mr. Friedland continues to attract exploration and mine development opportunities. He and his team at the Company are well placed to evaluate and pursue such opportunities.
Vanadium flow battery business rounds out electrification transition portfolio and provides growth opportunities in a rapidly growing end-user market
We believe that a vertically integrated vanadium flow battery business will round out the Company’s electrification transition portfolio and provides us with additional growth opportunities in what management considers a rapidly growing end-user market. Growing needs for renewable energy sources are expected to drive the demand for longer-lasting, safe and reliable high-performance vanadium flow batteries. VRB’s core technology is VRB-ESS®, engineered for low-cost manufacturing, optimal performance, and long-life. While lithium-ion batteries are well suited to power consumer electronics and electric vehicles, their battery lifetime is limited and would have to be replaced periodically throughout a grid-scale project’s lifetime.
We believe VRB-ESS® can be charged and discharged over an almost unlimited number of cycles without wearing out, providing the lowest lifecycle cost of energy of any type of battery storage. In addition, VRB’s proprietary electrolyte formula contains no heavy metals and the liquid electrolyte is non-toxic, non-flammable and 100% reusable, making VRB-ESS® fundamentally superior to lithium-ion batteries for grid scale energy storage.
Vanadium pentoxide (“V2O5”) is a key input factor and cost driver of VRB-ESS®. As part of its strategic business plan, VRB has been working on vertically integrating into V2O5 production through recycling of vanadium-bearing waste products, principally produced by petroleum refineries. In 2020, VRB established a joint venture with Yang Xing Vanadium (“YX”) to operate a 1,800 tpa V2O5 plant in Vietnam, which agreement terminated in May 2022. This allowed VRB to secure an initial low-cost supply of V2O5 for battery production and realize revenues from the sale of a portion of the vanadium produced. VRB has approximately 1,200 tonnes of feedstock at YX and 44.2 tonnes of semi-finished product with YX which may be processed at the site should production recommence with YX or another processor.

As used herein, references to the “Santa Cruz Technical Report Summary” is to the “Mineral Resource Estimate Update and S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary for the Santa Cruz, Texaco, and East Ridge Deposits, Arizona, U.S.A.”, prepared by Nordmin and Met Engineering, current as of December 31, 2022, which was prepared in accordance with the requirements of S-K 1300. The Technical Report Summary on the Santa Cruz Project, Arizona, U.S.A. is incorporated by reference as Exhibit 96.1 hereto. Scientific and technical information in this section is based upon, or in some cases extracted from these reports.
Location, Infrastructure, Project Description, Location, and Access. Our Santa Cruz Project is located 11 km west of the town of Casa Grande, Arizona, and is an approximately one hour drive south of the State capital of Phoenix. It is less than 10 km southwest of the Sacaton deposit, which was previously mined by American Smelting and Refining Company Inc. (“ASARCO”) and covers a cluster of deposits/targets approximately 11 km long and 1.6 km wide.

Map: Santa Cruz Project Location
The Greater Phoenix area is a major population center (approximately 4.95 million people) with a major international airport, well-developed infrastructure, and services that support the mining industry. The cities of Casa Grande, Maricopa and Phoenix supply sufficient skilled labor for the Santa Cruz Project. The Santa Cruz Project is accessed from the Gila Bend Highway, 11 km from the City of Casa Grande.
Title. The Santa Cruz Project lies primarily on private land, which consists predominantly of split estate between surface and subsurface mineral rights. We hold an option on the purchase of the mineral estate while holding an exclusive agreement on surface access.
In 2021, IE executed an agreement with Central Arizona Resources (“CAR”) for the right to acquire 100% of CAR’s option over the DR Horton Energy (“DRHE”) mineral title and CAR’s Surface Use Agreement (“SUA”) with Legend Property Group (“Legend”). The Santa Cruz exploration area covers 47.71 km2, including 25.79 km2 of private land, 2.6 km2 of Stockraising Homestead Act (“SRHA”) lands, and 238 unpatented claims, or 19.32 km2 of U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) land.
The agreement with DRHE provides that we (by way of assignment from CAR) have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire 100% of the mineral title in the fee simple mineral estate, 39 Federal unpatented mining claims, and three small, approximately 10 acre surface parcels, by paying $27,870,500 in cash or in shares of our common stock at the election of DRHE over the course of four years. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid a total of $11,620,500 to DRHE and expect to pay the balance by 2025. In order maintain the option we must make the following three additional payments:
•on or before August 16, 2023, we must pay a further $6,250,000 to DRHE; and
•if we exercise the option, we must pay to DRHE a final payment at closing of the acquisition of the mineral title of $10,000,000.
27


Table of Contents

We have until August 16, 2024 to exercise the option with DRHE. If we do not exercise the option, payments made to DRHE prior to August 16, 2024 or earlier abandonment of the option, including payments already made, are non-refundable.
The agreement with DRHE also provides us with a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) with respect to certain surface parcels owned by Legends. This ROFR was reserved by DRHE when the property was sold to Legends in 2007, and this right is now part of the option we acquired from DRHE.
Our surface use agreement with Legends gives us the exclusive use of the property for the purposes of drilling and geophysical testing, as well as granting us a separate right of first offer (“ROFO”) on the sale of the surface rights owned by Legends. In order to maintain our surface rights access from Legends we must make certain payments to Legends. As of December 31, 2022, we made payments totaling $1,600,000 to Legends. In order to maintain our surface use access we must make an additional payment to Legends on or before September 9, 2023, of $800,000 to Legends.
The surface use access agreement with Legends ends on August 3, 2025, but we may extend it to August 3, 2026 by making a further payment to Legends of $920,000.
In addition, we have acquired certain options on private parcels and staking of unpatented federal lode mining claims. The Santa Cruz Project exploration area covers 47.71 km2, including 25.79 km2 of private land, 2.6 km2 of SRHA lands, and 238 unpatented claims, or 19.32 km2 of the BLM land.
The following map shows the various mineral and surface rights at the Santa Cruz Project, including unpatented mineral claims we have acquired directly.

Table of Contents

Current exploration is conducted on private land under the SUA with Legends. Permitting has consisted of filing Notices of Intent to Drill and Abandon with Arizona Department of Water Resources (“ADWR”), a dust control permit with Pinal County, and a Construction General Permit/Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan with Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. We intend to identify specific permits to construct and operate mine facilities as the potential design of the Santa Cruz Project advances.
Royalty interests on the Santa Cruz Project include royalties in favor of ASARCO Santa Cruz, Inc. and Freeport Copper Company of a combined 5% NSR derived from DRHE portions of the project area and in favor of Simmons Devcor Company of a 10% NSR on specific parcels (capped to $7 million with consumer price index calculation). In addition, six other NSR royalties in favor of several individuals encumber specified parcels of the project area with NSR royalty rates of 2.25%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.075%, 0.015% and 0.0125%. No royalty encumbers the entire known mineral resources at the Santa Cruz Project, other than the ASARCO Santa Cruz, Inc. and Freeport Copper Company royalty. The Simmons Devcor Company royalty and the several individual royalties aggregating to 2.09% encumber specified parcels of the project. NSR royalties are only payable upon production and sale of product. There are no advance royalties.
Property Condition and Stage of Development. The Santa Cruz Project is an exploration stage project without mineral reserves. No mining activity has ever taken place on the land constituting the Santa Cruz Project. There is no mine in production at the project.
There is currently no significant equipment, infrastructure or facilities at the Santa Cruz Project, and no mine development or operating equipment at the project site.
Permitting and encumbrances. Current exploration is conducted on private land under the SUA with Legend. Current permits are listed in the Table below.

The Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits “Take” without prior authorization by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS”). Santa Cruz has implemented beneficial practices in accordance with USFWS Nationwide Standard Conservation Measures which include employee education, preconstruction surveys, nest monitoring, and avoidance of active nests. This may affect access points and the ability to perform work on the property. 
Table of Contents

Existing and past land uses in the Project area and immediately surrounding areas include agriculture, residential home development, light industrial facilities, and mineral exploration and development. Some dispersed recreation occurs in the area. The climate is dry, and most of the Project area is flat, sandy, and sparsely vegetated. Portions of the Project area are in the 100-year flood plain of the North Branch of Santa Cruz Wash. Within the Project area, approximately 85 acres of land located 1.2 km north of the intersection of N. Spike Road and W. Clayton Road was used during an in situ leaching project in 1991. A Phase 1 Environmental Site Audit (“ESA”) was conducted on the Project area.
There is a large private land package covering the Project area and area of known mineralization. This private land position could result in reduced permitting time relative to projects required to undergo the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) process. The precise list of permits required to authorize the construction and operation of this Project will be determined as the mining and processing methods are designed. If NEPA and other federal permitting are avoided, required permits would be administered by Arizona State, Pinal County, and Casa Grande authorities.
The permit approval process for some permits includes review and approval of the process design. Thus, the project design must be substantially advanced to support the application for those permits. These technical permits typically represent the “longest lead” permits. Technical permits with substantial technical design are needed as part of the applications. The anticipated issuing agencies include:

Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit Types. The Santa Cruz Project lies along a northwest to southeast trending, approximately 600 km long porphyry copper belt that includes many productive deposits such as Mineral Park, Bagdad, Globe-Miami, and the neighboring Sacaton. These deposits lie within the Basin and Range province that covers most of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The porphyry copper deposits within this trend are the product of igneous activity during an approximately 80 Ma to 50 Ma orogenic event that involved northeast-directed subduction and a northwest-southeast-striking magmatic arc. During Basin and Range tectonic extension, porphyry copper systems were dismembered, tilted and buried beneath basinal deposits that now fill the Casa Grande Valley. Prior to concealment, the porphyry systems of Arizona experienced supergene enrichment events that make them economically significant deposits.
The Santa Cruz system (comprising the Santa Cruz, Texaco, Park-Salyer, and Sacaton deposits) represents one or more large, Laramide-aged porphyry copper systems that were subsequently enriched by supergene processes. Supergene enrichment is a mineral deposition process in which near-surface oxidation produces acidic solutions that leach metals, carry them downward, and reprecipitate them, thus enriching sulfide minerals already present. Sometime following the development of supergene mineralization, the Santa Cruz system was dismembered, displaced, and eventually buried as a result of Basin and Range extensional tectonism.
Mineralization at the Santa Cruz Project is generally divided into three main types:
•Primary hypogene sulfide mineralization: chalcopyrite, pyrite, and molybdenite hosted within quartz-sulfide stringers, veinlets, veins, vein breccias, and breccias as well as fine to coarse disseminations within vein envelopes associated with hydrothermal porphyry-style mineralization. Hypogene mineralization appears to be the most concentrated within the Southwest Exploration Area, Texaco Ridge Exploration Area, and Texaco Deposit areas based on IE drill holes. 
•Secondary supergene sulfide mineralization: dominantly chalcocite which rims primary hypogene sulfides and completely replaces hypogene mineralization. Other sulfides that fall within this category include lesser bornite and covellite as well as djurleite and digenite which have been identified by historic XRD analyses. Supergene sulfide mineralization developed as sub-horizontal domains, known as “chalcocite blankets”, within the phreatic zone (below the paleo water table). They result from the weathering, oxidation, and leaching of sulfides under oxidizing conditions in the vadose zone (above the water table) and the transport and re-precipitation of copper sulfides in a more reducing environment below the water table.
•Secondary supergene “oxide” mineralization: chrysocolla (copper silicate) with lesser dioptase, tenorite, cuprite, copper wad, and native copper, and as copper-bearing smectite group clays. This mineralization style resides

immediately above supergene sulfide mineralization near the paleo water table. Superimposed in-situ within the copper oxide zone is atacamite (copper chloride) and copper sulfates (e.g., antlerite, chalcanthite). Atacamite accounts for much of the copper grades within the oxide zone and requires formation of a brine to precipitate.
Exploration and Drilling. We completed a twin hole program in 2021 to validate the historical drill data and produce an initial Mineral Resource Estimate in 2021 (December 8, 2021) and accompanying Technical Report Summary (June 7, 2022).
Our exploration in 2021 – 2022 included:
a.Geophysical surveys – ground gravity, ground magnetics, Typhoon™ three-dimensional Perpendicular Pole Dipole Induced Polarization (“3D PPD IP”), refraction, and passive seismic.
b.Drilling – a combination of diamond drill and rotary drilling totaling 88 holes and approximately 55,291 m.
Combined with the historical exploration, there are over 170 drill holes totaling over 133 km length within the Santa Cruz Project area.
Sampling, Analysis and Data Verification. Nordmin and Met Engineering are not aware of any drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results. In the opinion of Nordmin and Met Engineering, the drilling, core handling, logging and sampling procedures meet or exceed industry standards and are adequate for the purpose of Mineral Resource estimation.
The authors of the Santa Cruz Technical Report Summary consider the QA/QC protocols in place for the Santa Cruz Project to be acceptable and in line with standard industry practice. Based on the data validation and the results of the standard, blank, and duplicate analyses, the authors are of the opinion that the assay and specific gravity databases are of sufficient quality for Mineral Resource estimation for the Santa Cruz Project.
Mineral Resources. The December 31, 2022, Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) includes a detailed geological and structural re-examination of the Santa Cruz, East Ridge, and Texaco Deposits.
The Santa Cruz Deposit MRE benefits from approximately 116,388 m of diamond drilling in 129 drill holes, the East Ridge Deposit MRE has 18 holes totaling 15,448 m, and the Texaco Deposit MRE has 23 drill holes totaling 21,289 m. All drill holes were completed from 1964 to 2022.
Diamond drill hole samples were analyzed for total Cu and acid soluble Cu using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy ("AAS"). A decade after initial drilling, ASARCO re-analyzed select samples for cyanide soluble Cu (AAS) and molybdenum (multi-element ICP). The Company currently analyzes all samples for total Cu, acid soluble Cu, cyanide soluble Cu, and molybdenum. Due to the re-analyses to determine cyanide soluble Cu within historic samples, there are instances where cyanide soluble Cu is greater than total Cu. It has been determined that the historic cyanide soluble assays are valid as they align with recent assays in 2022 drill holes.
The Santa Cruz Project mineral resource estimate is presented in the table below and is current as of December 31, 2022.

(1)The Mineral Resources in this Estimate were independently prepared, including estimation and classification, by Nordmin Engineering Ltd. and in accordance with the definitions for Mineral Resources in S-K 1300. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. This estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. Verification included multiple site visits to inspect drilling, logging, density measurement procedures and sampling procedures, and a review of the control sample results used to assess laboratory assay quality. In addition, a random selection of the drill hole database results was compared with the original records. The Mineral Resources in this estimate for the Santa Cruz, East Ridge, and Texaco Deposits used Datamine Studio RMTM software to create the block models. The Mineral Resources are current to December 31, 2022. Underground-constrained Mineral Resources for the Santa Cruz Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.70% total copper, Texaco Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.80% total copper and East Ridge Deposit are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.90% total copper. The cut-off grade reflects total operating costs to define reasonable prospects for eventual economic extracted by conventional underground mining methods with a maximum production rate of 15,000 tonnes/day. All material within mineable shape-optimized wireframes has been included in the Mineral Resource. Underground mineable shape optimization parameters include a long-term copper price of $3.70/lb, process recovery of 94%, direct mining costs between $24.50-$40.00/processed tonne reflecting various mining method costs (long hole or room and pillar), mining general and administration cost of $4.00/tonne processed, onsite processing and SX/EW costs between $13.40-$14.47/tonne processed, offsite costs between $3.29 – $4.67/tonne processed, along with variable royalties between 5.00-6.96% NSR and a mining recovery of 100%.

Tintic Project, Utah, USA
As used herein, references to the “Tintic Technical Report” is to the “SEC Technical Report Summary, Exploration Results Report, Tintic Project Utah, U.S.A.” prepared by SRK with an effective date of May 5, 2021, which was prepared in accordance with the requirements of S-K 1300. The Technical Report Summary, Exploration Results Report, Tintic Project Utah, U.S.A. incorporated by reference as Exhibit 96.2 hereto. Scientific and technical information in this section is based upon, or in some cases extracted from these reports with the addition of updated lands information and associated expenditures from IE dating from after May 5, 2021.
Location, Map, Location, and Access. Our Tintic Project is located approximately 95 km south of Salt Lake City, Utah and can be accessed by road from U.S. Highway 6 approximately 30 km west of the Interstate 15 junction. The center of our claims and applications lies at approximately at 39° 55’ N latitude and 112° 06’ W longitude. The city of Eureka lies approximately 2 km north of the northeastern Tintic Project property boundary. The exploration area covers approximately 65 km2 of patented claims and unpatented claims and an additional 75 km2 of state leases and prospecting permits that have been consolidated by us into a cohesive grouping of mineral interests.

The Tintic Project area hosted historic mining communities and activities, but only two communities remain today at Eureka and Mammoth. The historic mining area straddles the Tintic Mountains divide between the Utah and Juab Counties. The county line occurs at the watershed divide.
Infrastructure. The Tintic Project is managed out of the city of Eureka (population approximately 700), which is approximately 2 km north of the northeastern Tintic Project property boundary. Eureka offers limited services. Equipment and other services are generally obtained from the towns of Tooele or Payson/Spanish Fork, which are each a 45-minute drive. We have established a permanent presence in the Tintic District and are currently headquartered out of Eureka with office facilities. We have also developed a secure core logging and storage facility at the mouth of the Mammoth Valley.
Water for the Tintic Project can be sourced from the city of Eureka’s maintenance yard at a cost of $0.01 per gallon (~3.8 litres). The exploration area also contains several small ephemeral springs that are productive in the early spring but does not contain any streams or rivers owing to the arid nature of the climate. The Rocky Mountain Power Company provides electric utilities to the Eureka community and a high-power transmission line services Eureka, Mammoth, and Silver City. Gas is supplied by a local company. Limited supplies and personnel are available from Eureka; however, the main source is the Salt-Lake City-Ogden- Provo metropolitan area, a corridor of contiguous urban and suburban development stretched along a 190 km segment of the Wasatch Front with a population of 2.7 million.
Title. The single most limiting factor for the development of mining in recent times relates to the complex land ownership within the district. We have acquired 65 km2 of mineral tenure in the historic mining district surrounding the Tintic Project through various agreements and permit applications made through our subsidiary TC&G. We are in the process of consolidating all interests in respect of the Tintic Project under TC&G.
We or TC&G have entered into purchase and sale agreements with five different vendor groups owning mineral title at the Tintic Project. Under these purchase agreements, payment of the purchase price is deferred and no title will transfer until the purchase price has been paid in full. Until such time, the mineral titles are held with a third party escrow agent. We are required to pay a total of $30,800,000 to acquire all of these titles with all payments to be made by the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid a total of $27,275,000 and have a total of $3,525,000 remaining to pay by the end of 2023.
As of the date of this Annual Report, we hold various types of claims and applications, which consist of the following claims, lease agreements, and permits:
•Patented claims — 190 claims for 10.6111 km2
33

•Unpatented claims — 464 claims for 12.2119 km2
Purchased, but held in escrow
•Patented claims — 254 claims for 7.6542 km2
Leased with Option to Purchase
•Patented claims — 94 claims for 3.8435 km2
•Unpatented claims — 6 claims for 0.5016 km2
Leased without Option to Purchase
•85 claims for 5.2890 km2
SITLA
•12.1 km2 of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Association (“SITLA”) mineral leases in three agreements
Prospecting Permits
•6 Hardrock Prospecting Permit (“HRPP”) applications on Bankhead-Jones lands in the Tintic Valley, comprising 61 km2 (through Continental Mineral Claims Inc. (“CMC”) owned by TC&G)
To retain an unpatented claim on United States federal land, a maintenance fee of $165 per claim is due annually by September 1st. Based on our current landholding this would amount to $74,580 in annual payments for claim retention. The claim positions of the Tintic Project are intended to provide a cohesive, contiguous land package for the potential future extraction of mineralization in relation to the known geology of the area.
The HRPP applications, on non-core areas of the Tintic project, were filed in 2017. In 2019, the US Government passed the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation and Recreation Act, which provided for, in part, a land exchange between the United States and the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands (the “Dingell Exchange”). The Dingell Exchange lands included of a portion of the lands covered by the HRPP Applications. Based on the authorization of the Dingell Exchange, BLM issued rejections of the HRPP Applications in and around July 2022. TC&G appealed the rejections, in part, on the basis that BLM lacked authority to reject the pending HRPP Applications solely on the basis of the Dingell Exchange. TC&G’s appeal is currently pending before the Interior Board of Land Appeals.

Significant portions of the patented claims at the Tintic Project are subject to NSR royalties ranging between 1% and 4%. NSR royalties are only payable upon production and sale of product. There are no advance royalties.
Property Condition and Stage of Development. The Tintic Project is an exploration stage project without mineral reserves or mineral resources. There is no mine in production at the Tintic Project and no mining activity by us has ever taken place on the land constituting the Tintic Project.
There is currently no significant equipment, infrastructure or facilities at the Tintic Project, and no mine development or operating equipment at the project site. There is no mining or operating infrastructure at the Tintic Project that would be intended to be used in future mine operations.
History. Mineralization in the Tintic District was discovered in 1869, and by 1871 significant mining camps were established in the nearby city of Eureka, and the now defunct towns of Silver City and Diamond. Mineral extraction focused on high-grade Ag-Pb-Zn oxide carbonate replacement deposits (“CRD”) hosted in Paleozoic limestone both at surface and underground, with lesser production from steeply dipping Au-Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu fissure veins. The Tintic precious and polymetallic mining district saw nearly continuous mining operations from 1871 through to 2002 with variations in the level of activity and commodity extracted. Total historic production from deposits located within our acquired property, predominantly in the Tintic mining districts, totals approximately 1.9 Moz Au, 136 Moz Ag, 105 kt Cu, 416 kt Pb and 6 kt Zn.
The main precious and base metal bearing minerals in the Tintic District are enargite, tetrahedrite, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite, and native gold, silver, and copper. However, many more mineral species are present, including exotic tellurium-bearing species. There are clear metalliferous domain changes across the Tintic District with Cu-Au dominance in the Main Tintic District transitioning northwards into Pb-Ag and finally into Pb-Zn in the northern portion of the district. This zonation leads us to believe that the Main Tintic district likely contains the porphyry source of the polymetallic bearing fluids.
Permitting and encumbrances. In March 2021, TC&G submitted a Notice of Intention to Conduct Exploration to the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining of the Department of Natural Resources of the State of Utah. The approved permit will allow our proposed drilling program to be undertaken. The Tintic Project has no other required permits for current activities.

There are two Recognized Environmental Conditions (“REC”) present on the Tintic project lands in the form of old mill sites. We do not anticipate doing any work in these areas, and therefore do not expect to trigger any potential environmental liability.

Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit Types.
The host rocks at Tintic are Pre-Cambrian through Paleozoic sediments and carbonate rocks and were emplaced to their current position primarily during the Sevier orogeny (Cretaceous), forming a series of folds and thrusts, including a synform which forms the key host sequence in the Main Tintic District.
The ‘Deep Creek-Tintic’ mineral belt is an east trending zone of basement highs marked by Cenozoic calderas and associated metal endowment all along the belt. The East Tintic Mountains, where the belt terminates, host the Tintic District, the second biggest mining district in Utah after the Bingham District, located approximately 65 km north of the Tintic Project. The Bingham stock lies approximately at the intersection of the Wasatch hinge line and the ‘Bingham-Park City’ mineral belt, coinciding with the Cheyenne suture zone and the Uinta arch, concentrating tectonic and igneous activity. The Tintic District lies at the eastern margin of the ‘Deep Creek-Tintic’ mineral belt where it terminates against two or more north-south trending range front faults. Metallic minerals at Tintic and Bingham are hosted along northeast striking, steeply dipping, thrust faults, related to the Sevier orogeny. Intrusions along the Uinta arch in the Wasatch intrusive belt are high potassium calc-alkaline and metaluminous I-type granitoids similar to the igneous intrusions at Tintic. Eocene to early Oligocene intrusions, the source of mineralizing fluids, were emplaced in an extensional stress regime with northwest-southeast least principal stress. Basin and Range extension began around 18 Ma, forming high-angle normal faults which resulted in block tilt and the present Basin and Range topography. Fluid inclusion studies from plutons in the Wasatch Mountains indicate a 15-20 eastward tilt of the range and paleomagnetic data from the Oquirrh Mountains are consistent with an 11 eastward tilt related to the Basin and Range. The East Tintic Mountains were uplifted and rotated 10-20 east, similar to the Oquirrh Mountains.
The Tintic District has been broadly divided into four sub-districts: North, East, Main and Southwest. The following describes the stratigraphy, structure, volcanism, mineral deposit types and zoning patterns, including mineralization and alteration, observed in the four sub-districts, and summarizes the effects of Basin and Range extension on the Tintic District. The East Tintic Mountains are underlain by a basement sequence of more than 800 m of phyllic slate, quartzite and dolomite from the Neoproterozoic Big Cottonwood Formation, outcropping along the axis of the North Tintic anticline. A sequence of more than 3,700 m of Paleozoic (ranging from Cambrian to Mississippian periods) carbonate and clastic sedimentary strata lies unconformably on top. This sequence is characterized by a thick basal Cambrian Tintic Quartzite, succeeded by a thick sequence of dominantly limestone and dolomite. During the Sevier orogeny, from Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous, the East Tintic Mountains were uplifted and deformed in a series of north-trending, north- plunging asymmetrical folds cut by coeval thrust faults, high-angle strike-slip and tear faults. Three major folds deform the Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic sequence in the Tintic district.
Our interests in the Tintic District are focused on the southern portion of the Main District where Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and late Eocene — Oligocene volcanic rocks are intruded by the Silver City intrusive complex. Over 2,000 m of Paleozoic stratigraphy is exposed at the property ranging from the early Cambrian Tintic Quartzite at the western flank through the Mississippian Humbug Formation on the east. The rocks above the Tintic Quartzite are predominantly comprised of limestone and dolomite with a few units that have a greater siliciclastic component. Thin-skinned thrusting during the Sevier orogeny resulted in a complex pattern of faults and folds in the Paleozoic stratigraphy dominated by the east-west Sioux-Ajax fault through Mammoth and a large, east-verging asymmetric anticline-syncline pair that is cut by northeast trending faults. The thrust faults that underly this folding have been identified in mines in the East Tintic District and locally at surface when not covered by later volcanic rocks. North of the Sioux-Ajax fault, the ‘ore runs’ of the Main District occur as sub-horizontal bodies connected by chimneys or pipes where crossed by faults in the shared subvertical limb of the anticline-syncline pair and along the axis of the Tintic syncline at the eastern margin. Exposure of Paleozoic rocks south of the Sioux-Ajax fault is limited to a less than 2 km2 area between the Silver City intrusive complex to the southwest and overlying volcanic rocks to the southeast; it does not show the magnitude of folding found to the north of the fault. Instead, the beds here dip moderately to the northeast and are cut by steep reverse faults referred to as fissures when mineralized which continue south to the contact with the intrusion. These fissures and the subvertical chimneys and pipes tend to be more Cu-Au rich than the sub-horizontal Ag-Pb-Zn rich ‘runs’ north of the fault. Where these fissures intersect the contact with the Silver City intrusive complex, deposits of massive Fe-oxide and halloysite occur such as the Dragon Mine.
Mineralization in the Tintic District is typical of a porphyry-epithermal magmatic hydrothermal system. Known deposits predominantly occur as CRDs and epithermal veins with a few small porphyry deposits including the SWT

porphyry in the Southwest District and the Big Hill porphyry in the East District. Exploration prospects identified by us on the Tintic Project include CRDs in the Paleozoic stratigraphy, areas with porphyry exploration potential in the Silver City intrusive complex and at depth below the CRDs, and skarns at intrusive contacts in the carbonate rocks.
Exploration and Drilling. Exploration by us on the Tintic Project commenced in late 2017 with an airborne geophysical survey. On-the-ground exploration commenced in early 2018 and included a ground geophysical survey and a geological baseline work program consisting of soil and rock grab sampling, age dating, petrology, mapping, prospecting, and identification of key intrusive and alteration phases. Additional work through 2018 into 2019 included the re-logging of deep historic drillholes at the Dragon exploration area and the compilation and 3D digitization of historical mines, underground workings, and mineralized zones termed ‘runs’.
In late 2021 we completed a small exploration drill program consisting of two reverse circulation (“RC”) holes and a fan of four diamond drill holes. We have also compiled a drillhole database from over 125 years of exploration and development operations in the Tintic Project district by dozens of historical owners and operators. A total of 489 drillholes were completed historically on the Tintic Project by several prior owners and operators. However not all of the details are available.
Typhoon™ has also completed a 72 km2 fully 3D IP survey, with effective penetration depths averaging over 1.5 km, which revealed never before seen porphyry Copper-Gold exploration potential areas that are ready to drill. Diamond drilling commenced in late November 2022 in the Silver City area testing between two Typhoon™ anomalies. Drilling will continue into 2023 with assay results not expected to start until at least the first quarter of 2023.
Our current database contains known collar locations for 442 diamond, RC and rotary air blast drillholes totaling approximately 72,212 m. The accuracy and certainty of collar locations are variable, due to the many sources of information. Some collar coordinates were derived from georeferenced maps and figures, and abandoned mine-grid translations, each of which have uncertainties attached to them regarding their positions. Forty-seven holes have collar locations recorded in undocumented or unknown mine-grid datums and will be added to the database when their locations can be deduced. 193 drillholes are collared on the Applied Minerals “Dragon” halloysite mine property (12,635 m total), and consist primarily of geotechnical, geological, and mineral data pertinent to the clay and iron-oxide mining operations there. While the authors of the Tintic Technical Report note that drillhole positions should be treated with caution when utilized for geological modelling, due to the varied level of accuracy, they note that they can be utilized for regional scale geological modelling, which we have completed in Leapfrog Geo™.
Assay results have been compiled from 221 drillholes across the Tintic Project district. Records of analytical methods for assay data are limited and the assay database consists of variable element analyses. These range from comprehensive 43 element ICP-MS data from analyses performed on drillhole core from the Big Hill diamond drillhole program conducted from 2008 to 2014 in the East Tintic sub-district, to Cu-Au only results from RC drilling in the Treasure Hill area. In the opinion of the authors of the Tintic Technical Reports, historical drillhole analytical results should be treated with caution and only utilized for indicative purposes until twin drilling is completed to verify position, orientation and grade, as no supporting QA/QC information is available for the respective drillholes.
Sampling, Analysis and Data Verification. All soil and rock grab samples collected by us during exploration programs undertaken to date have been prepared and analyzed by ALS Global-Geochemistry Analytical Lab in Elko, Nevada (“ALS”). ALS is a reputable analytical laboratory with a global quality management system that meets all requirements of the international standards ISO/IEC 17025:2017 and ISO 9001:2015. ALS has a robust internal QA/QC program to monitor and ensure quality of assay and other analytical results.
The security measures employed by us for both the soil geochemical survey and rock grab sampling programs were as follows. At the completion of each field day, all samples were bagged in large rice sacks with approximately 20 samples (20 kg) per sack. Each rice sack was labeled with the company name, bag number and the sample IDs contained within it. This information was recorded into an inventory spreadsheet. The sacks were sealed using zip ties and marked with colored flagging tape. All samples were secured at our field office in Mammoth prior to dispatch to the lab. The Mammoth facility doubles as a bunkhouse for our geologists who maintained control and security of all samples. Samples were dispatched to the ALS prep-lab by our geologists who maintained chain of custody until the samples were received by ALS. Prior to dispatch, a senior geologist of ours prepared an inventory and shipping slip of the dispatch. All rice bags were checked against the inventory slip which was then approved and signed. A chain of custody form was completed and signed by both our and ALS staff upon delivery to the Elko facility.
The soil samples were prepared using a standard ALS preparation package, which analysis yielded raw spectral files in ASD and ASCII format, and a spreadsheet with mineral assemblage interpretations with the spectral parameters of the soil.

The rock grab samples were prepared using a standard ALS preparation package, which measured 48 elements. Gold was measured by fire assay and ICP-AES analysis.
We have implemented two standard insertion protocols for soil and stream sediment samples (which have 5% duplicate and 4% standard insertion rates) and drill core, rock grab, pit, trench, and chip samples (which have 5% blank, 5% duplicate, and 4% standard insertion rates). Inert crushed white marble is used as blank material. OREAS 151b standards in 60g packets are used for the porphyry-epithermal samples including all 2018 soil and rock grab samples. This is a certified OREAS low-grade Cu standard for porphyry Cu-Au exploration. Lab assay certificates were imported into an access database that merged geochemical and spectral data with the sample field data and location information. We have implemented an internal QA/QC program to monitor all assay results from laboratories by comparing results of our inserted standards, blanks and duplicates against expected values. If any assay certificate fails the QA/QC check, the lab is immediately notified for investigation and possible re-assay. The blank samples generally produced values substantially lower than 5 times the lower detection limit for Au, Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which is within industry acceptable standards, however there were no failures. The performance of the certified reference material analyses was also within acceptable limits.
The 2018 soil and rock grab sample collection, security, preparation, and analytical procedures used are appropriate for the type of mineral exploration that is being undertaken and the stage of the Tintic Project. The authors of the Tintic Technical Report consider the QA/QC measures taken to be appropriate and the performance of blanks and standards to be acceptable, and note that the duplicates indicate no significant biases in the data.
Data verification conducted by the authors of the Tintic Technical Report included a site visit to the Tintic Project and a desktop study. SRK personnel completed a site visit to the Tintic Project in November 2020, which included an overview of the history and geological setting of the Tintic Project area, and a field examination of selected historical mine workings and the prospective areas identified for exploration drill testing. This included the underground workings at the Mammoth Mine and the Sioux-Ajax Tunnel which occur in CRD exploration potential areas and the porphyry deposit drilling exploration potential areas as well as the Mammoth Shaft and the Glory Hole Shaft. The authors of the Tintic Technical Report reviewed and accepted the information supplied by us. Historical information was verified from several web and literary sources where possible. The analytical results were checked against the relevant laboratory certificates, and no transcription errors were noted by the QPs. The QPs did not request any check assays as no mineral resources or exploration tonnages and grades have been delineated at the Tintic Project.
The authors of the Tintic Technical Report found the information to be comprehensive and logically archived and the data management and database compilation procedures are consistent with standard industry practices, and also reviewed and accepted the supplied information and considered it to be geologically appropriate and adequate for use in the Company’s ongoing exploration efforts at the Tintic Project.
Hog Heaven Project, Montana, USA
The Hog Heaven Project is located on private land approximately 85 km south-southwest of the town of Kalispell in Flathead County, Montana and is accessed by driving 16 km of gravel road from the highway.
Brixton Metals Corporation (“Brixton”) owns the Hog Heaven Project through its subsidiary Brixton USA, covering an area of 24.32 km2 through the following interests: 2.59 km2 of deeded fee simple land both surface and minerals and 14.06 km2 of fee simple mineral rights held by Brixton USA. The balance, 7.67 km2, is held via lease of three parcels owned by the Chester Company Ltd.
We entered into an earn-in agreement on February 26, 2021 with Brixton as well as a subsidiary of Brixton, pursuant to which we may earn up to a 75% interest in the Hog Heaven Project by making cash payments totaling $4,500,000 and incurring an aggregate of $40,000,000 in exploration expenditures by 2032. We own 3% of the outstanding shares of Brixton, which we acquired from Newstar Advantage Ltd., an entity affiliated with Mr. Friedland (“Newstar”) on October 1, 2021 for C$2.0 million. Newstar acquired shares and warrants of Brixton in a private placement for a purchase price of C$2.0 million. Brixton used the funds to purchase a portion of a royalty on the Hog Heaven Project owned by Pan American Silver Corp. on which the Company had an earn-in.
Under our earn-in agreement with Brixton, we have the right to earn a 51% interest in the Hog Heaven Project by making a total of $4,500,000 in cash payments and incurring $15,000,000 in exploration expenditures at stage 1. We may also earn an additional 24% interest (for a total 75% interest) in the Hog Heaven Project by incurring an additional $25,000,000 in exploration expenditures at stage 2. In order to complete stage 1, in addition to incurring $15,000,000 in exploration expenditures, we are required to make $500,000 in cash payments each year for four years, and $1,000,000 in

cash payments on or before each of the fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date of the earn-in agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we had incurred $3.1 million in exploration expenditures and made $1,000,000 in cash payments.
In order to complete stage 2, which is at our sole discretion, we would be required to incur an additional $25,000,000 in expenditures of which we must incur $10,000,000 by February 26, 2030 and $15,000,000 by February 26, 2032. For purposes of this earn-in, a joint venture company, Brixton JVC, a Nevada corporation, was established. We earn into the Hog Heaven Project by acquiring stock of Brixton JVC. Pursuant to the earn-in agreement, we are the operator of the Hog Heaven Project. We also control and direct all exploration, development and other related activities while we are earning-into the Hog Heaven Project.
From the date that stage 2 is complete until the date that Brixton JVC makes a decision to commence the development and construction of an operating mine at the Hog Heaven Project, we and Brixton must each fund the activities and operations of Brixton JVC pro rata to our respective interests in the Hog Heaven Project, provided that, if requested by Brixton, we are required to fund its pro rata portion of the costs of the activities and operations of Brixton JVC, with such amount accruing with interest calculated at the annual rate equal to the U.S. Federal Reserve Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus seven percent. At the date a construction decision is made, the amounts we previously funded to Brixton will become due and payable to us, and shall be paid within 12 months of the date a construction decision is made, failing which Brixton would be subject to dilution pursuant to a standard dilution calculation.
Royalties. If a party’s interest in Brixton JVC is diluted below 10%, then the interest of such party in Brixton JVC will be cancelled and its shareholding interest converted into a 2.0% NSR. In addition, one NSR royalty at a rate of 1.5%, three Net Profit Interest (“NPI”) royalties with rates of 5% and 10%, and one Net Revenue Interest (“NRI”) royalty with a rate of 10% (capped at $1,314,702) exist on various portions of the property. The three sections of Chester Company Ltd. lands are subject to a long-term lease that requires a $12,500 annual lease payment.
History. There are several high sulfidation epithermal mineral deposits and prospects within the bounds of the Hog Heaven Project as well as several now-closed mines, including the Flathead Mine. The past producing Flathead Mine was a silver-rich, high sulfidation epithermal mineral system positioned on the margin of a diatreme breccia body and had one of the highest silver to gold ratios (2,233:1) of any high sulfidation epithermal deposit in the world. We believe that the Flathead Mine is just one small part of a much larger mineralized system that has remained unrecognized by past miners and explorers.
The Flathead Mine was mined by Anaconda Mining Inc. from 1929 to 1946, producing approximately 241,000 tons of direct-ship Ore averaging 26.6 oz/ton Ag. A lessee mined the Flathead Mine from 1963 to 1975 producing 49,700 tons averaging 9.35 oz/ton Ag. Other previously mined high sulfidation epithermal mineral deposits within the bounds of the Hog Heaven Project including the Ole Hill and West Flathead Mines located 1.6 km west of the Flathead Mine; the Margarite Mine, south of Flathead Mine; the Martin Mine just northwest of Margarite Mine with indications of very high-grade Ag, Au, Cu, Pb, and Zn mineralization at lower levels of the mine; the Battle Butte Mines west of Margarite Mine; and the Donald and Francis Mines west of Martin Mine.
Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit Types. Mineralization in the Hog Heaven Project area comprises silver-gold-copper-lead-zinc high sulfidation epithermal replacement and vein-breccia deposits. The Hog Heaven Project is located in the Little Bitterroot Valley, a north-northwest trending, 6 to 8 km wide valley bounded by mountains with elevations of 1,500 m to 2,500 m and rising 300 m to 800 m above the valley floor. The Hog Heaven Project is underlain by Proterozoic Belt Supergroup strata just east of the axis of the north-northwest-trending Purcell Anticlinorium and is intruded and unconformably overlain by Early Oligocene volcanics. At the Flathead Mine, stratabound and replacement orebodies occur along stratigraphic horizons in the upper bedded diatreme zone adjacent to a mega-clast of latite porphyry (previously referred to as the central latite porphyry dome).
Exploration. Prior exploration in the greater Hog Heaven Project area consisted of surface soil geochemical surveys over airborne electromagnetic geophysical targets, confirmation and/or updating of surface mapping, and rock chip sampling. We have completed due diligence studies on recent and historic drilling and on surface geochemical results. This includes relogging approximately 13,700 m of drill core to confirm and/or update the geologic model; surface rock chip sampling at the Flathead Mine to confirm metal distribution and grades; and re-sampling of approximately 2,600 pulp samples from historic drill holes at the Flathead and Ole Hill Mines with results pending. We have also reprocessed Brixton’s 2018 airborne electromagnetic survey data, and an inversion model was produced to help guide exploration. Initial drill targets were picked from the inversion results and drill pads were permitted and bonded with the Montana Department of Environmental Quality. A three dimensional IP survey was completed over the Hog Heaven Project area in the summer of 2021 to further assess target potential and to generate new drill targets. A detailed ground gravity survey covering the Hog Heaven project area was completed in September of 2021.

Drilling. Drill targeting for both extensions to existing deposits and new target concepts was based on the results of the geophysical and geochemical surveys. A drill program commenced in October 2022 with two holes drilled before weather shut down drilling for the winter. The drill program is expected to continue in 2023.
Planned Work Programs. In 2023, we plan to continue geological mapping and sampling activities, in addition to continuing the drilling program to investigate several deep anomalies.
Sama Nickel-Copper-Palladium Project, Ivory Coast
The Ivory Coast Project is located approximately 650 road km northwest of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. As of December 31, 2022, our interest in the Ivory Coast Project was held through our 22.8% equity interest in Sama and our 30% interest in the Sama Nickel Corporation Inc. (“Sama Nickel”) joint venture described below. As the Ivory Coast Project is the only significant mineral project in which we have an interest outside of the western hemisphere, we are considering longer term strategic alternatives for our interest in the project (as well as our interest in Sama Nickel and our 22.8% equity interest in Sama as of December 31, 2022) in order to maintain our focus on our other projects in the western hemisphere. While we currently intend to complete our earn-in and acquire a 60% interest in the Ivory Coast Project, following such time we may consider a disposition of such interests, a joint venture or other structure to monetize the value of these interests. We are not currently in negotiations or discussions with any party regarding our interest in the Ivory Coast Project.
The Ivory Coast Project consists of three exploration permits owned by Sama Nickel, a subsidiary of Sama, which is the joint venture vehicle in which we are partnering with Sama to advance the Ivory Coast Project, which cover a total of 517 km2, as well as two additional exploration permits held in a joint venture with Société pour le Développement Minier de la Côte d’Ivoire (“SODEMI”), a parastatal organization established by the Ivory Coast and which together cover 318 km2.
In March 2018, we entered into a binding term sheet for an earn-in and joint venture agreement with Sama which was subsequently formalized in March 2021 (the “Sama Earn-In and JV Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Sama Earn-In and JV Agreement, we have the ability to earn a 30% shareholding interest in the Ivory Coast Project by incurring expenditures of C$15,000,000 over a maximum of six years. By incurring additional expenditures of C$10,000,000 within the same time period, including the financing of a bankable Feasibility Study and the acquisition of an exploitation permit on part of the Ivory Coast Project, we will be entitled to earn an additional 30% shareholding interest in the Ivory Coast Project, such that our aggregate shareholding interest therein shall be 60%. In August 2021, we reached the initial C$15,000,000 expenditure threshold and as a result we acquired a 30% shareholding interest in Sama Nickel.
In April 2018, pursuant to an investment agreement, Sama granted to us a right to nominate to the Sama board of directors two (2) directors as long as our shareholding interest of Sama remains above 10% but less than 50%, and four (4) directors if our shareholding rises to greater than 50%. As of the date of this Annual Report, Mr. Eric Finlayson and Mr. Govind Friedland are our director nominees on the board of Sama, both of whom were most recently re-elected at the annual meeting of shareholders of Sama held on June 17, 2021. Other than as shareholders of Sama, we do not have any interest in Sama’s gold projects in Liberia or its nickel-copper project in Québec, Canada.
Overview. In 2009, Sama entered into an agreement with SODEMI, a parastatal organization established by the Ivory Coast, under which Sama was to explore the area covered by the former Permit No. 123 (“PR123”), held by SODEMI in the Ivory Coast. The former PR123 encompassed approximately 446 km2. As a result, Sama became responsible for financing exploration work programs until the completion of a bankable Feasibility Study. SODEMI was not required to contribute to the exploration work conducted by Sama Nickel.
In June 2019, two new exploration permits, Samapleu East (“PR838”) and Samapleu West (“PR839” together with PR838, the “PRs”), replacing the former PR123, were granted to SODEMI. The PRs together cover 318 km2, expire on June 18, 2023, and can be renewed for periods totaling up to 12 years. In accordance with both PRs, Sama Nickel agreed to complete an exploration program budgeted at approximately $5,200,000 for PR838 and approximately $1,700,000 for PR839 before the term of the exploration permits expires. In September 2019, Sama Nickel and SODEMI signed an amendment to their agreement under which the parties confirmed Sama Nickel and SODEMI respectively hold a 66.7% interest and a 33.3% interest in the two new exploration permits, notwithstanding any future request for an exploration permit.
PR838 is close to the village of Yorodougou, about 50 km west of Biankouma and 25 km east of the border with Guinea. PR838 has an irregular shape, with a maximum north-south extent of 24 km and 16 km along the east-west direction, for a total area of 258 km2.
Upon completion of a bankable Feasibility Study, an advisory committee which consists of two Sama Nickel representatives and two SODEMI representatives would conclude on the feasibility of the Ivory Coast Project. If the 
40


Table of Contents

advisory committee were then to decide to proceed with the project, an exploitation (mining) entity would be established whereby future funding would be split between Sama Nickel and SODEMI at 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively.
Sama Nickel, through other subsidiaries, owns exploration rights on three additional exploration permits (PR300, PR604 and PR837) adjacent to PR838 and PR839 for a combined 839 km2. These three PRs are 100% owned by Sama Nickel. PR300 expired December 18, 2021, and application to renew was filed before such expiry. The renewal process is ongoing. PR604 expires on December 8, 2022 and a renewal application has been lodged. The remaining permits expire on July 18, 2023.
Technical Report. Sama has filed a technical report prepared in accordance with NI-43-101, which is an instrument developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators and administered by the provincial and territorial securities commissions that govern how issuers in Canada disclose scientific and technical information about their mineral projects to the public, for the Ivory Coast Project, titled “NI 43-101 Technical Report — Preliminary Economic Assessment Samapleu Project” and which was prepared jointly by Daniel M. Gagnon, P.Eng., Schadrac Ibrango, P. Geo, Ph.D, MBA, Nalini Singh, P.Eng., Ryan Cunningham, P.Eng., Volodymyr Liskovych, Ph.D, P.Eng., Marie-Claude Dion St-Pierre, P.Eng., dated June 1, 2020 but with an effective date of May 22, 2019 (“Ivory Coast Technical Report”). The report was filed on the System For Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”). Scientific and technical information in this section regarding the Ivory Coast Project is based upon, or in some cases extracted from, the Ivory Coast Technical Report.
Preliminary Economic Assessment. The Ivory Coast Project was the subject of a June 2020 Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “Sama PEA”). Highlights of the Sama PEA included estimated average annual production of 3,900 t of carbonyl nickel powder, 8,400 t of carbonyl iron powder and 14,100 t of copper concentrate over a 20-year mine life. Capital costs to develop the project were estimated at $282,000,000 including contingency of $37,000,000, with operational costs of $2,062/t products and $23.96/t milled. The Sama PEA generated an after-tax NPV (at an 8% discount rate) of $391,000,000 and after-tax IRR of 27.2%.

(1)Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio- political, marketing, or other relevant issues. The CIM definitions were followed for the classification of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred Resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is reasonably expected that a portion of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded with continued exploration. Pit shell defined using 52-degree pit slope, copper concentrate price of $2.1/lb and nickel powder price of $13.5/lb, $3/t mining costs, $15/t of processing and G&A costs, and a resulting cut-off grade of 0.1% NiEq.
Planned Work Programs.
In 2023, we will be focusing on technical trade off studies of the Samapleu and Extension deposits and the Grata discovery to support estimates of the value of these deposits, which may lead to an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) of the Ivory Coast Project.

White Hill Project, Nevada, USA (the “White Hill Project”). Our White Hill Project is located in the Gillis Range, Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 32 km east of Hawthorne and 160 km southeast of Reno, Nevada. The project is situated within the Fitting Mining District and comprises 1,016 federal mineral claims covering 84.95 km2 managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The project hosts demonstrated copper-bearing skarn-style mineralization.
We entered into an agreement with the project owner, Exiro Minerals USA Corp. (“Exiro”) on February 22, 2023 which give us the right to earn an 80% interest in the White Hill Project by incurring $10.0 million of expenditures and making payments to Exiro totaling $4.95 million ($3.55 million in cash and $1.4 million in our common stock) within six years of signing the agreement. During the earn-in period, we have the exclusive right to operate, control and direct all exploration and mineral development activities at the White Hill Project. There are no minimum expenditures required in any given year, and we have the right to cease making payments at any time, resulting in us earning no interest in the project.
Should we earn into 80% of the project, the joint venture will form, and we will then be obligated to fund the next $30 million of development expenditures to advance the project. After that expenditure, each joint venture partner will contribute pro rata to the joint venture or be subject to standard dilution provisions related to its project interest. In the event that Exiro is to be diluted to less than 10%, it will retain a 10% project interest and we will carry Exiro’s funding obligation through to commercial production. At commercial production, Exiro will become obligated to repay such funded amounts to us within 12 months of commercial production. No royalties are to be granted as part of this agreement. We also have a right of first refusal over Exiro’s interest in the joint venture.
We have not yet commenced exploration activities at the White Hill Project.
Bitter Creek Project, Arizona, USA (the “Bitter Creek Project”). Our Bitter Creek Project is located in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States, approximately 20 km east of Wickenburg. The project area is accessible via a 40-minute drive from Wickenburg. We operate the Bitter Creek Project through a wholly- owned subsidiary, Bitter Creek 
43


Table of Contents

Exploration, Inc. The Bitter Creek Project consists of 348 lode mining claims that are valid through to September 1, 2022. The total area of the project is 35.21 km2 comprised of three exploration permits totaling 6.87 km2 and 348 unpatented claims. The Bitter Creek Project has hosted two historic mines and several exploration projects.
We initially commenced field work and staking in late 2019 which carried through into 2020. This field work included prospecting, soil sampling (33 samples), stream sediment sampling (122 samples), rock grabs (110 samples) and heavy mineral sampling (48 samples). In 2021, a contractor flew an airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey over the entirety of the Bitter Creek Project area. In spring 2022, we conducted a Typhoon™ 3D IP survey, which revealed a large chargeability anomaly. Interpretation and integration with surface mapping and sampling is underway to produce drill ready targets. Our exploration activities have not included any drilling activities nor are we aware of any historic drilling on the Bitter Creek property.
Carolina Mining, North Carolina, USA (the “Carolina Joint Venture”). We entered into a binding letter of intent in November 2021 to form a joint venture with the Carolina Mining Company (“CMC”), a private company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Once the joint venture agreement has been executed, we will have the obligation to spend up to $1,000,000 over two years to acquire private mineral rights and surface access with the rights to drill test a series of electromagnetic (EM) conductors defined by CMC’s VTEM survey flown in 2021. Once these funds have been expended, we then will have the right to earn 51% in the joint venture formed with CMC by spending an additional $5,000,000 over a 3-year period and the further right to increase our interest in the joint venture to 85% by spending an additional $20,000,000 over 5 years or by completing a Feasibility Study.
CMC owns mineral rights and surface access to two historic mining sites that operated in the early to late 1800s. These include the Silver Valley mine, a VMS deposit discovered in 1880 with limited zinc, lead, silver, and gold production due to the difficulty of Smelting and recovering precious metals from zinc-rich ores and Conrad Hill, a deposit mined in the early 1830s that produced high grade gold (>1 oz/t) from a series of orogenic quartz veins carrying significant copper values.
In 2021, CMC flew a Geotech VTEM survey over a 16 km by 19 km area to explore for additional massive sulfide mineralization in the Ordovician volcanic-sedimentary rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt. This resulted in defining seven EM conductors ranging in strike length from 300 m to 1300 m. Inversion modelling by CGI showed two of the EM conductors extend from 200 m below surface to depths >700 m and are potentially tens of meters in thickness. Inversion modelling was not possible on the remaining EM conductors due to the proximity to cultural interference by cast iron water pipes and power lines located along most North Carolina County roads.
Starting in late September 2022, a 3-week program of ground Typhoon™ EM was carried out over three of the VTEM anomalies to better define their geometry and depth extent. CGI 3D inversion modeling was completed in January 2023 over one of the EM grids that will provide targeting detail for drill testing in 2023.
The EM conductors are located on fee-simple private land in Davidson County, North Carolina that include both surface and mineral title. Options to purchase mineral rights and surface access for exploration and mining are being negotiated with the individual owners based on overall acreage and strike extent of the EM conductors within their land holdings. All the land that constitutes the Carolina Joint Venture will be subject to a 1.5% NSR and a further 2.0% NSR should CMC take dilution of their 15% interest in the Carolina Joint Venture.
Desert Mountain Project, Utah, USA (the “Desert Mountain Project”).  Our Desert Mountain Project is located in southwest Utah in Juab County. The closest towns include Delta and Eureka. The Desert Mountain Project is approximately 100 km southwest of Salt Lake City with access via paved roads and 22 km of gravel roads. We operate the Desert Mountain Project through a wholly-owned subsidiary company, LSE. The only previous mineral exploration and development on the property was historic in nature and focused on the now-closed Porter Mine. Historic production is not known. Copper was the primary target of the former mine. The Desert Mountain Project consists of 13.86 km2 of unpatented Federal mining claims (166 claims) wholly-owned by Little Sahara Exploration Inc. (“LSE”).
Our exploration at Desert Mountain has included rock grab samples (50 samples), whole rock analysis (18 samples), magnetic and gravity geophysics and two RC drill holes. Both holes were completed by early September, 2021 with DMR-002 intercepting low-grade Cu mineralization from surface to 68.6 m of 299 ppm Cu including 6.1m at 938 ppm Cu and DRM-001 awaiting a diamond core tail. Exploration plans for 2023 include completing the suspended drill program, which will include diamond tails of rotary holes.
Grasshopper, Montana, USA (the “Grasshopper Project”). Our Grasshopper Project is located in southwestern Montana. The closest towns are Bannack and Argenta. The Grasshopper Project is about 60 km south of Butte. A circular topographic feature centered on a magnetic anomaly was first identified in 1976. Since 1977, 24 shallow rotary holes and 1

diamond drill hole have been completed along with mapping, soil sampling, ground magnetics, and an IP Survey. The Grasshopper Project consists of 7.19 km2 of unpatented Federal mining claims (86 claims) wholly-owned by IE Montana Holdings Corp.
Lincoln Project, Utah, USA (the “Lincoln Project”). Our Lincoln Project is located in southwest Utah in Beaver County. The Lincoln Project is approximately 330 km from Salt Lake City and accessible by gravel roads from the paved road. We operate the Lincoln Project through our wholly-owned subsidiary Lincoln Cave Exploration Inc. (“LCE”). The project area consists of 34 patented claims and 121 unpatented Federal mining lode claims optioned from Grand Central Silver Mines Inc. (“GCSM”). There are another 330 unpatented Federal mining lode claims covering 22.87 km2 and SITLA leases covering 11.86 km2.
GCSM is selling the mineral titles to LCE for cash payments totaling $3,000,000 over six years and retains a 2% NSR royalty, of which one half (1%) can be purchased by LCE for $1,000,000, and a further quarter (0.5%) can be purchased for $1,500,000 within ten years of the effective date (July 23, 2021). LCE holds a right of first refusal on the sale of GCSM’s royalty.
The Lincoln Project area encompasses numerous historic small underground workings with little record of production. Almost no modern exploration has occurred on the Lincoln Project. 
Starting in October 2022, using Typhoon™, a program of 3D-style pole-dipole DCIP was carried out over an area approximately 2.5 km wide and 5.5 km long. CGI 3D inversion modeling is complete. 
Unity Project, Oregon, USA (the “Unity Project”). Our Unity Project is located in Baker County, eastern Oregon southwest of Baker City, just outside the community of Unity and at the southern end of the Wallowa Whitman National Forest. The Unity Project is approximately 515 km southeast of Portland, Oregon, 225 km northwest of Boise, Idaho and is accessible by paved road. We operate the Unity Project through CMC, our wholly-owned subsidiary.
The Unity Project comprises 458 unpatented claims filed with the BLM. The Unity Project is centred on a Tertiary porphyry system of the same age as the Bingham Canyon Copper-Gold Mine in Utah owned by Rio Tinto as well as our Tintic Project in Utah. A 2% NSR royalty on all minerals encumbers the project. Three-quarters of the royalty (1.5% NSR) can be bought back for $12,000,000 within 12 months of the public announcement of the start of construction of a mine. We retain a right of first refusal for the remaining 0.5% of the NSR. Consultants, Seven Devils Exploration Ltd., will operate the first $5,000,000 in project expenditures with a 7.5% management fee.
We acquired the claims comprising the Unity Project in June 2018 through an agreement for staged payments payable to two vendors totaling $5,000,000 over six years. As of December 31, 2022, we had paid $750,000 to the vendors. Option payments of $2,000,000 on the fifth anniversary of the agreement and $2,250,000 on the sixth anniversary are required to complete the acquisition of the claims.
No exploration work had been conducted at the project area since the 1980s until we optioned the property in 2018 and we expanded the claim holdings. In 2018, we flew a helicopter-borne magnetic and radiometric survey over the Unity and Pole Creek claim blocks and the area between them. In 2021, we followed up the geophysical surveys with surface geologic mapping and sampling.
Starting in July 2022, using Typhoon™, a program of 3D-style pole-dipole DCIP was carried out over an area approximately 3 km wide and 5 km long. CGI 3D inversion modeling is complete.
Yangayu, Papua New Guinea. Exploration license EL2668 Yangayu (“Yangayu”) is located between the headwaters of the southerly flowing Tauri and Kapau Rivers in the Morobe and Gulf Provinces of Papua New Guinea (“PNG”). Yangayu covers 1,100 km2 and is currently registered to Goldsearch International Pty Ltd (“GSI”), a private Australian company.
In October, 2021, we and our PNG subsidiary entered into an Exploration Alliance Agreement with GSI (the “Exploration Alliance Agreement”). Under the agreement, GSI has agreed to exclusively help us identify, acquire, explore and develop promising mineral titles in PNG, of which Yangayu is the first. As mineral title transfers are not allowed in PNG within the first two years after title grant, GSI has agreed to transfer 100% of Yangayu to us after the expiration of this two-year transfer restriction in May 2023. Under the Exploration Alliance Agreement, GSI will inform us of other prospective licenses and we will have 60 days to determine whether to acquire them. If we do, they will become “designated projects” under the Exploration Alliance Agreement, similar to Yangayu. We manage all designated projects and will approve and pay for all programs of work (including all third party payments). GSI acts as the operator of all designated projects under our direction. Early stage geochemical sampling commenced at Yangayu in December 2021 and is ongoing.

San Matias Project, Colombia (the “San Matias Project”). The San Matias Project, which is 100% owned by Cordoba, is located in the Municipality of Puerto Libertador, Department of Córdoba, Colombia, and is approximately 200 km north of the city of Medellín. The site is road-accessible from the town of Puerto Libertador, approximately 20 km away. Cordoba holds exploration licenses covering around 146 km2 and has an additional 893 km2 of exploration licenses under application. The Alacran Deposit is subject to a 2% NSR, with an advanced royalty payment of $500,000 commencing at the earlier of three years after the receipt of approvals to commence construction at Alacran, or six years after filing for approval to commence construction at Alacran. We hold the right to 62.5% of this 2% NSR.

On July 31, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement with Cordoba. Under that agreement, Cordoba granted us a right to nominate directors to its board of directors based on our pro rata interest in Cordoba. The investment agreement provides for our nominees to the Cordoba board to be reduced to less than a majority of the directors if our ownership interest in Cordoba is diluted to below 50%, with further proportional reductions thereafter. Assuming the board of Cordoba is to be comprised of seven directors and we hold a 50% or greater interest in Cordoba, we are entitled to nominate four, with at least one of such nominees being independent.
Cordoba has filed a Canadian NI 43-101 technical report for the San Matias Project, titled “NI 43-101 Technical Report and Prefeasibility Study, San Matías Copper-Gold-Silver Project, Colombia” and which was prepared jointly by Glen Kuntz, P. Geo., Joanne Robinson, P.Eng., Steve Pumphrey, P.Eng., Kurt Boyko, P.Eng., Harold Harkonen, P.Eng., Chris Martin, C.Eng., Wilson Muir, P.Eng., Patrick Williamson, P.G., and Peter Cepuritis, MAusIMM, and with an effective date of August 3, 2021 (“San Matias Technical Report”). The San Matias Technical Report was filed on SEDAR. Scientific and technical information in this section regarding the San Matias Project is based upon, or in some cases extracted from, the San Matias Technical Report.
In January 2020, Cordoba began the studies required to secure the necessary Colombian mining approvals at the San Matias Project. Cordoba commenced an Environmental Impact Assessment (the “EIA”) and the Mining Technical Work Plan (the “PTO”), which are required to secure the necessary Colombian mining approvals for the Alacran Deposit. Cordoba submitted the PTO to the appropriate Colombian authorities in November, 2021. Cordoba must submit the EIA in the first half of 2024 in order maintain the validity of the licenses and be eligible for receipt of applicable mining approvals.
The National Mining Agency suspended the Alacran title from May 2020 through to November 2020 as a result of security concerns. Some residents of the local communities in the San Matias Project area have historically been involved in activities that would be disruptive to the orderly development of the Project, including civil insurrection and illegal artisanal mining on the property. Since recommencing work on the San Matias Project in November 2020, there have been incidents in which some members of the Alacran Community have demonstrated opposition to Cordoba’s operations. These incidents have included blockades on transport of equipment and personnel and initiation of legal proceedings contesting Cordoba’s rights to the San Matias Project. Cordoba has been able to continue operations despite these incidents, although such incidents have slowed the progress of work on site.
Cordoba completed a PFS for the Alacran Deposit in January 2022. The PFS, conducted by Nordmin, indicates Probable Mineral Reserves totaling 102.1 Mt grading 0.41% Cu, 0.26 g/t Ag, and 2.30 g/t Au diluted. Setting the life of the mine at 13 years, the PFS also estimated production of 22,000 t per day through conventional open pit mining operation with an average annual production of 68.8 Mlbs Cu, 55 koz Ag, and 386 koz Au. Total recovered production is estimated to be 849 Mlbs Cu, 0.7 Moz Ag, and 4.7 Moz Au, with metallurgical recoveries averaging 92.5% Cu, 78.1% Ag, and 62.9% Au in copper and precious metal concentrates. The Cu concentrate is expected to contain very low contents of deleterious elements, such as arsenic and lead.
The PFS estimates initial capital expenditures to be $434.9 million, while total capital expenditures for the Life of Mine, including sustaining capital, reclamation and closing costs, are estimated at $591.0 million. The financial analysis in the PFS anticipates that 60%, or $292.1 million, of the initial capital expenditure can be financed by debt. The PFS further sets expected payback at the 2.4 year mark at metals prices of $3.60/lb Cu, $1,650/oz Ag, and $21.00/oz Au as of January 2022, with after-tax Net Present Value estimated to be $415 million. The Alacran Mine is expected to generate $190.4 million in government royalty revenue, plus $514.2 million in income tax revenue to support government programs in Colombia. In its analysis, the PFS did not include the satellite deposits at Montiel East, Montiel West and Costa Azul.

(1)The Mineral Resources in this estimate were independently prepared by Nordmin Engineering Ltd., and the Mineral Resources were prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014) and the CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (2019). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not demonstrate economic viability. This estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant issues. Verification included multiple site visits to inspect drilling, logging, density measurement procedures and sampling procedures, and a review of the control sample results used to assess laboratory assay quality. In addition, a random selection of the drill hole database results was compared with original records. The Mineral Resources in this estimate for the Alacran deposit used Datamine Studio RM™ Software to create the block models and Geovia’s Surpac™ and Whittle™ software to constrain the resources and create a conceptual OP shell for the deposit. Assumptions used to prepare the conceptual pit for the Alacran deposit include:
•Metal prices of $3.25/lb Cu, $1,600.00/oz Au, and $20.00/oz Ag;
•Operating cost inputs include:
•Mining cost of $1.73/t for saprolite and $2.30/t for transition and fresh rock for the overall LOM;
•Processing costs of $1.78/t for saprolite and $8.85/tonne fresh and transition rock. This includes assumptions for milling, G&A, and tailings. These equate to approximately 0.03% copper equivalency for saprolite and 0.17% copper equivalency for fresh and transition rock;
•98.0% mining recovery, 2.0% dilution and 41°-48° pit slope in fresh and transitional rock, and 36.5° in weathered saprolite;
•Freight costs of $30.00t concentrate from the mine to port and $82.00t concentrate port to a smelter;
•Treatment costs of $85.00/t dry concentrate, payable metal factors of 95.0% for Cu, 96.5% for Au, and 90.0% for Ag;
•Refining charges of $0.085/lb Cu, $5.00/oz Au, and $0.30/oz Ag;
•An NSR cut-off of $1.78/t for saprolite and $8.85/t for transition and fresh rock has been applied to Alacran. The NSR value was calculated using preliminary production and processing parameters and commodity metal prices as follows:
•NSR_Cu = Cu_% * MiningRec_% * MillCuRec_% * 51.53/% Cu (On Site Value);
•NSR_Au = Au_g/t * MiningRec_% * MillAuRec_% * 46.55 $/g (On Site Value);
•NSR_Ag = Ag_g/t * MiningRec_% * MillAgRec_% * 0.54 $/g (On Site Value);
•NSR = NSR_Cu + NSR_Au + NSR_Ag; • Mill recoveries include a 0% Cu and Ag recovery for saprolite material;
•Copper equivalencies incorporate all the same dilution values, mining recovery values, mill recovery values, and downstream costs as NSR and are calculated directly from the NSR values and the 51.53 copper conversion factor above through the following formula:
•Copper Equivalency = NSR / 51.53;
The Mineral Reserves documented below are estimated based on CIM guidelines that define Mineral Reserves as “the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource” (CIM, 2014, p. 6)... “demonstrated ... by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study” (CIM, 2014, p. 7). This must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve “includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined” (CIM, 2014, p. 6).

The Mineral Resources in this estimate for the Satellite deposits used Datamine Studio 3™ software to create the block models and Datamine NPV Scheduler™ to constrain resources and create conceptual OP shells using Indicated and Inferred mineralized material (oxide and sulphide). Assumptions used to prepare the conceptual pits for the Satellite deposits include:
•Metal prices of $3.10/lb Cu, $1,400/oz Au, and $17.75/oz Ag;
•An NSR cut-off of $13.75/tonne has been applied. This equates to approximately 0.22% Copper equivalency as calculated in the Satellite deposit block models;
•Operating cost inputs include:
•Mining cost of $2.43/t mined for the first five years and $1.69/t thereafter;
•Processing cost of $8.63/t milled for the first five years and $7.50/t thereafter;
•G&A costs of $2.56/t milled for the first five years and $1.32/t thereafter;
•97.0% mining recovery, 4.0% dilution, and 45° pit slope in fresh and transitional rock and 32.5° in weathered saprolite;
•Variable process recoveries of 50.0% to 90.0% for Cu, 72.0% to 77.5% for Au, and 40.0% to 70.0% for Ag depending on the domain (saprolite, transition, or fresh sulphide) and Cu grade;
•Freight costs of $100.00/t concentrate, and treatment costs of $90.00/t dry concentrate, payable metal factors of 95.5% for Cu and 96.5% for Au and 90.0% for Ag. Refining charges of $0.090/lb Cu, $5.00/oz Au and $0.30/oz Ag;
•Cu equivalency has been used for the three Satellite pits and was calculated using: Copper equivalency % = Cu % + (Au Factor x Au Grade g/t + Ag Factor x Ag Grade g/t) x 100.
•Au Factor = (Au Recovery % x Au Price $/oz / 31.1035 g/oz) / (Cu Recovery % x Cu Price $/lb x 2204.62 lb/t);
•Ag Factor = (Ag Recovery % x Ag Price $/oz / 31.1035 g/oz) / (Cu Recovery % x Cu Price $/lb x 2204.62 lb/t);
•Variable process recoveries of 50.0% to 90.0% for Cu, 72.0% to 77.5% for Au and 40.0% to 70.0% for Ag depending on the domain (saprolite, transition, or fresh sulphide) and Cu grade;
Totals may not sum due to rounding.

(1)The Mineral Reserve Estimate was prepared by Nordmin. The effective date of the Mineral Reserves estimate is October, 31, 2021. The Mineral Reserve Estimate is based metallurgical recovery algorithms, that result in an overall recovery of 92.5% of Cu in the fresh and transition material, 78.1% Au in fresh, transition and saprolite, and 62.9% Ag in the fresh and transition material. Metal prices were set at 3.25 $/lb Cu, 1,600 $/oz Au, 20 $/oz Ag. The Mineral Reserve Estimate incorporates mining dilution and mining loss assumptions through regularization of block size and a mining recovery factor of 98%.
On March 15, 2021, Cordoba announced that it had been informed of an operation carried out by the Colombian National Police in Colombia to shut down illegal gold mining activities and to improve regional security at El Alacrán. The intervention by the Colombian authorities was in response to illegal gold mining activities being undertaken by a group of individuals on Cordoba’s title and was a direct result of the National Government’s initiative to eliminate illegal mining, through which there have been several similar interventions recently in other parts of the country. The Colombian National Police and Police against Illegal Mining act independently and take actions they consider necessary to maintain public order in the country. No Cordoba personnel were on site during the operation, and Cordoba resumed PFS fieldwork on March 20, 2021. The operation conducted by the Colombian National Police in March 2021 resulted in increased tension with some members of the Alacran Community and for the months following company personnel were accompanied by members of the military and Colombian National Police when conducting fieldwork near the community, in order to maintain security and deter conflict. The relationship with the community has now greatly improved, allowing Cordoba to complete its PFS work.

On December 8, 2022, Cordoba announced a strategic arrangement with JCHX Mining Management Co., Ltd. (“JCHX”), whereby JCHX, through a wholly owned subsidiary, will purchase a 50% ownership interest in CMH Colombia S.A.S. (“CMH”), a company existing under the laws of Colombia, for aggregate consideration of $100 million. CMH will own 100% of the Alacran Project and will be the joint venture vehicle for Cordoba and JCHX in the strategic project level partnership. For its 50% interest, JCHX will pay the $100 million purchase price in three installments. At the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2023, $40 million will be payable in cash as a first installment. A second installment of $40 million is payable in cash upon the board of directors of Cordoba approving the Feasibility Study of the Alacran Project, and the filing of the Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) to the relevant Colombian Government authority, but in no event will such second installment be paid later than the second anniversary of the closing of the transaction. A third and final installment of $20 million is payable in cash once the approval of the EIA is obtained, which must be within two years of the transaction’s closing date. Should the EIA not be approved by the second anniversary of the closing date, JCHX will have the option to elect not to complete this final installment, which will result in JCHX being diluted to 40% and Cordoba increasing to a majority 60% shareholding in CMH. 
On December 27, 2022, JCHX advanced a bridge loan of $10 million in cash to Cordoba. Upon closing of the transaction, the entire balance owing under the bridge loan and accrued interest will be applied towards the first installment payment as a payment in kind.
The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, and (1) Cordoba must receive approval from the TSXV and approval of shareholders (excluding JCHX and Ivanhoe Electric) and (2) JCHX must receive approval from its board of directors, shareholders, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, and Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce. Cordoba received the approval of its shareholders (excluding JCHX and Ivanhoe Electric) on February 8, 2023.
A Joint Venture Shareholders’ Agreement (“JV SHA”), which will be entered into at closing, will govern the strategic relationship between Cordoba and JCHX, and will set forth the general responsibility and authority of the CMH board of directors, in addition to the entitlements of each shareholder. The JV SHA will provide that (1) the CMH board will comprise four individuals, of which two directors will be nominated by Cordoba and the other two directors will be nominated by JCHX; and for so long as the shareholdings in CMH remain 50%-50%, a Cordoba representative will serve as the Chairperson of the CMH board, and will possess a casting vote on all matters subject to a list of reserved matters; (2) Cordoba will be appointed as the operator and manager of the Alacran Project pursuant to a management services agreement and will be responsible for setting the annual programs and budgets for the CMH board’s approval; (3) JCHX (or its affiliate) has right of first offer to bid on the Engineering, Procurement and Construction and Detailed Design Agreement contracts, provided that Cordoba has the right to open the process out to competitive tender; with JCHX having the right to match any competitive bid; and (4) JCHX (or its affiliate) shall be entitled to up to 100% of the offtake from the production under the current Feasibility Study of the Alacran Project, provided that they are paying fair market value and they are the most competitive offer (including a matching right for other third-party proposals).
Perseverance Project, Arizona, USA (the “Perseverance Project”). In August 2018, Cordoba, through a wholly-owned subsidiary Cordoba Minerals USA Corp., entered into a joint venture and earn-in agreement with Bell Copper Corporation (“Bell Copper”) and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to explore the Perseverance porphyry copper project located in northwestern Arizona, USA.
The Perseverance Project consists of mineral rights covering approximately 76.39 km2, comprising approximately 20.28 km2 held through a sublease of private mineral rights from Maverix Metals Corporation, and approximately 56.10 km2 held as 23 State of Arizona Mineral Exploration Permits located on State Trust Lands.
Cordoba has the option to earn up to an 80% interest in the Perseverance Project through the acquisition of an equity interest in the joint venture company MMDEX LLC (“MMDEX”), which was a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Bell Copper, by completing certain phased project expenditures totaling C$17,000,000 over a seven and a half year period, following which Cordoba would earn an 80% interest in MMDEX. On March 31, 2019, Cordoba’s Phase 1 project expenditures surpassed C$1,000,000 and Cordoba acquired 25% of MMDEX in May 2019. On March 17, 2022, Cordoba announced that it had made the Phase 2 expenditures required to earn a 51% interest in MMDEX and had vested a 51% interest.
The Perseverance Project lies along the axis of a north-northwest to south-southeast trending, 600 km long, porphyry Cu belt that has produced more than 10% of the world’s copper. The Project lies directly on this belt between Freeport’s Bagdad mine and the now dormant Mineral Park mine.
Pinaya Copper-Gold Project, Peru (the “Pinaya Project”). The Pinaya Project, which is 100% indirectly owned by Kaizen, as of December 31, 2022, covers approximately 101 km2 of granted title, 28 km2 under application and includes 
50

more than 10 km of underexplored strike length in southeastern Peru. Our Chief of Global Exploration, Mr. Finlayson, also serves as the interim President and Chief Executive Officer of Kaizen.
Kaizen has filed an NI 43-101 technical report for the Pinaya Project, titled “Pinaya Gold-Copper Project Technical Report” and which was prepared jointly by Brian Cole, P.Geo, and GeoSim Services Inc., with an effective date of April 26, 2016 (“Pinaya Technical Report”). The Pinaya Technical Report was filed on SEDAR. Scientific and technical information in this section regarding the Pinaya Project is based upon, or in some cases extracted from, the Pinaya Technical Report.

(1)Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Mineral Resources have an effective date April 26, 2016; Ronald G. Simpson, P.Geo. is the Qualified Person responsible for the Mineral Resource estimates. Mineral Resources are reported within a conceptual open pit shell based on metal prices of $2.84/lb Copper and $1236/oz gold and average metallurgical recoveries of 80%. The pit shell also considers a mining cost of $2.00/t for mineralized and waste material and $1.75/t for overburden; processing cost of $8.50/t; G&A cost of $1.50/t; and an ultimate pit slope angle of 45°. Copper-equivalent grade estimate based on $2.84/lb copper and $1236/oz gold. Mineral Resources are reported at cut-off grades of 0.25 g/t Au for the GOSZ and 0.3% Cu Equivalent for the WPZ and NWPZ zones. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest thousand tonnes; grades are rounded to three decimal places. Rounding as required by reporting guidelines may result in apparent summation differences between tonnes, grade and contained metal content.
In January 2021, Kaizen received drilling approval from the Ministry of Mines for an additional period of twelve months in order to complete a further exploration drilling program. A 10 hole drilling program commenced in November 2021 and was completed in January 2022. Assays of drill results were released in March 2022.
Past drilling at Pinaya included 160 holes by AM Gold Inc. between 2004 and 2008; and two holes by a previous optionee in 2014. Kaizen drilled three holes in first quarter 2020 before arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 1, 2021, Kaizen announced the results of a 3,046 m, 10 hole drill campaign which confirmed the presence of shallow gold mineralization associated with base metal veins and skarn. On October 3rd 2022, Kaizen released the results of a 92 km2 Induced Polarization survey which identified several additional buried targets for drill testing. Permitting for new drill pads to test these targets has started and is expected to take at least a year.
South Voisey’s Bay Project (the “SVB Project”). Fjordland Exploration Inc. (“Fjordland”) is a publicly listed mineral exploration company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada. On September 5, 2017, we entered into an investment agreement with Fjordland under which our subsidiary subscribed for 14,000,000 units of Fjordland. We also acquired the option to incur, on behalf of Fjordland, C$7,400,000 in exploration expenditures by October 31, 2024 (C$4,200,000 incurred as of December 31, 2022 including a C$1,400,000 initial investment into the company) and to make C$290,000 of property payments (C$90,000 incurred as of December 31, 2022) required to be made by Fjordland under its obligations with Commander Resources Ltd. (“Commander”). If the funding is completed and Fjordland acquires a 100% interest in the SVB Project from Commander, Fjordland has agreed to assign a 65% interest in the SVB Project to our subsidiary. To date, Fjordland has earned an aggregate 35% interest in the SVB Project.
We also have the right to nominate two directors to the Fjordland board of directors if we own between 10% and 50% of the common shares of Fjordland, and three directors if we own more than 50% of the common shares of Fjordland. Currently, Mr. Mark Gibson, our Chief Operating Officer, is the only director nominee of ours serving on the Fjordland board of directors. We also have an anti-dilution right with respect to future financings by Fjordland.
Fjordland’s main project is the SVB Project in Newfoundland and Labrador. Fjordland, as operator, also has an agreement to acquire 100% of the Renzy nickel-copper project located near Maniwaki, Quebec from Quebec Precious Metals Corp. Fjordland is also currently funding a small program on its West Milligan copper-gold project located within 4 km of the Mount Milligan copper-gold mine in central British Columbia, Canada. The project is a joint venture with Northwest Copper Corp. In September 2021, Fjordland announced that it had entered into a binding Letter of Intent with Vulcan Minerals Inc. to acquire a 100% working interest in 30 mineral claims (7.5 km2) located in the South Voisey’s Bay area, Labrador.

Fjordland also owns a 100% interest in the early stage Witch copper-gold porphyry project (also referred to as the South Chuchi project) located in the Quesnel Trough of central British Columbia.
Mineral Project Obligations and Payments
As described above, for many of our mineral projects, we do not own the underlying mineral titles or rights but maintain an option or a right to acquire such titles or rights. Such options or rights may be held through an option arrangement, an earn-in, or through the payment of deferred consideration.
The table below summarizes the cash payments that may be made in respect of each project. Commitments that are non-discretionary are payments we are required to make. Payments that are discretionary are payments that we are not required to make, but if we fail to make the payment in the amounts and when due, we will lose the rights associated with the project.

Computational Geosciences
Overview. CGI is headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was founded in 2010 in order to capitalize on advanced software technology developed at the University of British Columbia that was designed to improve mineral exploration. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 94.3% of CGI’s outstanding shares while 5.6% are equally held by CGI’s two co-founders. CGI was co-founded by Livia Mahler B.Sc., MBA, who currently serves as CGI’s Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Eldad Haber Ph.D., who currently serves as CGI’s Chief Technology Officer, and is a professor at the University of British Columbia.
Technology. CGI’s technology consists of sophisticated software codes and artificial intelligence (“AI”) that is used to process geophysical data (including that generated by Typhoon™) in order to build accurate 3D subsurface images that indicate the presence of various metals and minerals, as well as water and oil.
Services. CGI provides fee-for-service and software licensing agreements to customers in the area of critical minerals, energy and water exploration.
CGI’s services apply its geophysical data inversion codes on a geophysical data (included that of Typhoon™) collected by third party data acquirers as well as other sources such as public or private libraries, in order to construct and refine 3D subsurface images. These services help CGI’s customers in geophysical survey design through more accurately identifying potential resource targets for exploration while minimizing the operational footprint of those exploration activities. CGI also offers mineral prospectivity mapping services which are based on deep learning AI algorithms to help identify and rank prospective areas for critical minerals. In order to prepare diverse layers for AI algorithms, CGI uses unique tools such as data augmentation for sparse, unstructured data which enhance the results and provide critical knowledge of the subsurface for clients. Finally, CGI is also able to support mineral resource and grade estimates by geostatistically propagating sample assays to its 3D models with rock property and grade relationships.
Table of Contents

CGI applies its services to not only mineral projects but also to the global energy industry and in the search for underground water resources. In the energy sector, CGI has independently developed and collaborated to deploy a real-time 3D inversion service for resistivity logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) data, significantly optimizing well placement and well completion designs to maximize reservoir productivity. CGI is also able to monitor fluid substitution within reservoirs, whether for enhanced oil recovery or carbon capture and storage. CGI has entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with a major oilfield service provider for the worldwide royalty-free license of the LWD code plus support and maintenance. With respect to the identification of underground water resources, CGI’s technology can also be deployed to predict prospective areas or delineate known water aquifers.
Intellectual Property. CGI does not patent its software codes. CGI owns codes for magnetics, gravity, DC/IP and electromagnetics.
Market and Business Strategic. CGI’s intention is to grow its client base in the mining sector for existing geophysical inversion and AI based services in order to increase its revenue from third party sources. CGI is currently developing two new geophysical modelling products and has identified another solution for the AI-based platform digitization application. CGI is also building large geoscience databases from vast amounts of publicly available data in various countries and regions of the world in order to use these datasets to map minerals, water, geothermal and other targets. CGI competes with geophysical data processors, airborne and ground surveyors, off-shore surveyors, and AI service providers. These include companies such as TechnoImaging, LLC, Geotech Ltd., GoldSpot Discoveries Inc., KoBold Metals, PGS ASA, and SJ Geophysics Ltd.
On February 6, 2023, CGI, together with Clean TEQ Water Operations Pty Ltd, incorporated Go2Lithium Inc. (“Go2Lithium”), a British Columbia company in which each party owns 50%. Go2Lithium was formed for the purpose of financing, acquiring and/or joint venturing a portfolio of technologies to produce battery grade lithium salts from aqueous sources and to build extraction plants based on proprietary continuous ion-exchange direct lithium extraction technology.
VRB Energy
Overview. VRB, and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in designing, manufacturing, installing and operating energy storage systems. The major product of VRB is VRB-ESS®.
Our Interest in VRB. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we owned 90.0% of VRB’s outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2022. We acquired these shares in 2016 from Sparton Resources Inc. (“Sparton”), a corporation listed on the TSXV. Sparton holds the remaining 9.98% through one of its subsidiaries.
In June 2021, VRB issued a $24,000,000 convertible bond to BCPG, a publicly listed Thai renewable energy developer. The convertible bond is convertible into VRB common shares at the next equity financing round VRB completes, capped at a pre-money valuation of $158,000,000. At the time of the conversion of the BCPG convertible bond, we will also be required to convert our existing inter-company debt into additional VRB common shares. As a result, we expect that our ownership interest will be diluted by between approximately 13.6% and 14.4% (depending on several variables) when the BCPG bond is converted to VRB common shares.
Business of VRB. VRB operates primarily through its wholly owned foreign enterprise, VRB Energy Systems (Beijing) and other subsidiaries established in the PRC, Singapore, and the USA. VRB developed a MW-Class VRB-ESS system (“Gen1”) that was launched prior to our acquisition of an interest in VRB in 2016. Ongoing research and development (“R&D”) and project experience have allowed VRB to produce larger, more efficient and more cost-effective systems in each generation. VRB made significant improvements to the Gen1 system in developing the MW-Class Gen2 system that is currently being marketed. VRB has developed its Gen3 system based on a 1MW battery size and is now moving towards a Gen4 system.
VRB’s customers are broadly divided into commercial and industrial users located in China and internationally that are seeking reductions in energy costs and/or increased use of renewable energy and/or on-site power reliability; grid service providers that are developers, owners or aggregators providing flexible services to grid networks and seeking energy storage systems to enhance project economics or to broaden revenue streams; and utilities and wholesale energy market participants that are engaged in wholesale market trading activity or large-scale generation using energy storage for load balancing or revenue from arbitrage and associated activities.
VRB’s primary source of revenue is through the sale or lease of a VRB-ESS to customers and, depending upon customer requirements, VRB may sell only the power module components of a VRB-ESS (that is, excluding vanadium electrolyte) or a complete VRB-ESS system. The more common form of sale by VRB as an original equipment manufacturer is a direct sale of equipment with commitments to a customer ending with the supply and commissioning of 
Table of Contents

the VRB system. VRB also earns revenue from the provision of operation and maintenance services to its customers as and when required under separate contract.
VRB produced its own V2O5 through a tolling agreement in place with an existing producer ammonium metavanadate (“AMV”) until May 2022 and plans to further integrate into both V2O5 and electrolyte production. VRB sells surplus V2O5 in the form of AMV into the commodity market and plans to continue to do so in the future as its V2O5 production expands, whether as V2O5 or as AMV.
Strategy. VRB’s goal is to deliver the best technology at the lowest cost to large-scale utility energy storage projects around the globe. VRB has completed development of the new Gen3 system which is currently being marketed on a commercial basis. VRB is increasing expenditures on commercial development, especially regarding international certification of its batteries, as well as seeking market penetration in the United States. VRB is also working to increase its vertical integration. Following two years of tolling material to begin production of V2O5 (in the form AMV) with Vietnam Youngsun Tungsten Industry Co. Ltd at their current 1,800 tpa V2O5 plant in Vietnam, VRB is now finalizing a feasibility study for a wholly-owned 3,000 tpa V2O5 state-of-the-art facility with integrated electrolyte production and battery manufacturing in readiness for construction to commence in 2023. VRB is also executing early study work on V2O5 sourced from waste from large petrochemical refineries in India, North America, and Saudi Arabia.
VRB Intellectual Property. VRB has registered its key intellectual property in the PRC and certain countries internationally, including the United States, for the VRB-ESS system and component designs along with IP specific to the extraction of V2O5 from cinder and catalyst material sourced from oil-fired power stations and refineries. VRB and its subsidiaries have been issued 53 patents collectively in Mexico, the U.S., Chile, China, Indonesia, India, Japan and South Korea. A further 24 patent applications have been filed in China and one patent application has been filed in India.
Location and Employees. VRB currently operates a 10,000 m2 facility located outside of Beijing. Operating at full capacity, the facility is fitted to produce batteries with 50 MW per year of storage capacity with a single shift roster and can be expanded to 100 MW with double shifts. The facility also houses R&D, engineering services, project management and administration. To support future growth, VRB has a signed a framework agreement for the phased development of a ‘gigafactory’ in Hubei Province, PRC to manufacture the new Gen3 system. The province is planning multiple 100 MW-scale local projects, the first of which is expected to be awarded in 2023. VRB already has successfully contracted a 3 MW 4-hour (12 MWh) battery in Hubei which is considered a validated pilot system that has provided the foundation for the larger installations to follow.
Competition. VRB’s products compete mainly with lithium-ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries, with their history of use in small consumer electronics and electric vehicles (“EVs”), have been able to reduce costs over time, and as a result have been ahead of vanadium flow battery systems, which are only beginning to scale up as the ideal storage technology for utility grids. Vanadium batteries have traditionally been more expensive than lithium- ion batteries because of the high-cost of low-volume “off-the-shelf” components and materials. However, vanadium flow batteries have distinct and inherent advantages for long-duration and long-life applications, which means they are the ideal solution for the expected large-scale integration of solar and wind power onto utility grids around the world.
The risk of catastrophic fires or explosions in lithium battery projects remains a major differentiator to vanadium flow storage, which pose a much lower risk of fire or explosion. For the daily deep-cycling needs of solar and wind power, vanadium flow batteries also have a significant advantage in levelized cost of energy which is an industry metric for total cost of ownership that takes into account the degradation, limited depth of discharge and augmentation, i.e. replacement, costs of lithium-ion batteries, which vanadium flow batteries do not generally experience.
The major competitors to VRB in vanadium flow batteries are Invinity Energy Systems plc, Vionx Energy Corporation, Dalian Rongke Power Co., Ltd. and Sumitomo Corporation.
Mining and Mineral Project Exploration Laws
United States (Utah, Arizona)
Mining exploration and resource development operations in Utah and Arizona are governed by both federal and state law, and the Company is required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the exploration of minerals in the United States generally.
Utah — Tintic Project
The state of Utah has primacy over major mining and environmental laws applicable to the Tintic Project state and private lands, including mining, air and water permitting. With primacy, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
Table of Contents

(“EPA”) and other federal agencies have delegated primary enforcement responsibility for mining and environmental law oversight to the state of Utah. Mining operations must obtain proper permits and approvals and submit proper reclamation surety prior to mine start-up per state and federal statutory and regulatory requirements.
The BLM, as agent for the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, has retained responsibility for managing and overseeing federally owned locatable mineral resources (which includes metalliferous minerals) under the General Mining Law of 1872. When mining projects impact federal lands (minerals or surface), approvals from BLM are required per the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Federal actions requiring permits or approvals trigger compliance with the NEPA. The level of scrutiny a project receives is based upon BLM’s discretion, the significance of impacts to the environment, and/or the public’s interest or involvement. A portion of the properties within the Tintic Project are located on federal lands and the Company holds via lease or ownership a number of federal unpatented mining claims and, therefore, the Company’s operations on these federal lands will be subject to BLM regulatory oversight and permitting approval.
The Tintic Project is located primarily within Juab County, Utah, though small portions of the project are also located within Utah County. Both Counties’ ordinances require mining operations to obtain a Conditional Use Permit (“CUP”) prior to commencing mining operations. The Company will work with Juab County officials to secure the required CUP authorizations (and Utah County, as needed). In addition to the CUP, the Tintic Project will be required to obtain other ancillary permits and approvals (such as building and road access permits) from the county in accordance with the county’s ordinances.
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 was passed by Congress in order to protect and recover endangered species and their habitat. Site specific surveys will be completed for the Tintic Project area to identify any threatened, endangered, or candidate species or potential habitat. However, based on current information, it appears that the risk of impacts to endangered species and their habitat is limited.
The following table identifies the major permits and approvals that we will need to obtain prior to the construction and start-up of the mine and any processing facilities. The permits listed are not meant to be all-inclusive and cover only the major permits required for the mine and processing facilities. In addition, various rights-of-way “ROWs”) across state and federal lands may be needed from SITLA and BLM in order to construct project water and utility service infrastructure, and to upgrade existing roads. The Company has been in contact with SITLA and BLM regarding a number of aspects of the Tintic Project and does not anticipate that obtaining these ROWs presents a material issue.

Major Permits or Approvals | Issuing Agency 
Exploration Permit | Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining
Large Mine Operation Approval | Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining
Water Appropriations | Utah Division of Water Rights 
Air Quality Permit | Utah Division of Air Quality 
General Multi-Sector Industrial Storm Water Permit | Utah Division of Water Quality 
3809 Plan of Operation Approval | US Bureau of Land Management 
Army Corps of Engineers Jurisdictional Waters Concurrence | US Army Corps of Engineers 
County Conditional Use Permit and Other Permits | Juab County and Utah County 

Exploration Permits. Exploration activities for minerals require an approval from Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (“UDOGM”). Exploration activities within the Tintic Project area are being completed under exploration permits.
Approval for Large Mine Operation. The Notice of Intent to Commence Large Mining Operations must be obtained prior to the commencing of mining operations and will contain a complete description of the existing environmental resources and impacts. Environmental baseline studies will be necessary to support the Notice of Intent application. The Notice of Intent will include a description of mining methods, a comprehensive reclamation plan, and identifies the financial security acceptable to UDOGM to cover the costs of reclamation to be completed by an independent third-party as required under the Utah state administrative rules (R647). Execution of the acceptable financial security instrument will be required in advance of commencing mining activities.
Approval of a Notice of Intent to commence Large Mine Operations in Utah can occur within 6-9 months of an application submittal.
Water Appropriations. The Tintic Project is located within the Sevier River Basin. Surface and groundwater use and appropriations within the State, including this basin, are regulated by the Utah Division of Water Rights. Pursuant to the 
Table of Contents

current Sevier River Basin policy, the basin is closed to new surface and groundwater appropriations, so to meet the water requirements for the Tintic Project, we will rely on lease agreements or acquisitions of existing water rights within the area of the Tintic Project. We have commenced discussions with water rights holders regarding the lease or acquisition of existing water rights.
General Multi-Sector Industrial Storm Water Permit. A storm water pollution prevention plan (“SWPPP”) must be prepared as outlined in the general industrial permit prior to receiving permit coverage. The drainage control plan developed as part of the mining and reclamation plan will be used to develop the SWPPP. The SWPPP must be fully developed, and permit coverage granted prior to breaking ground at the Tintic Project site.
Army Corps of Engineer’s (“ACOE”) Jurisdictional Waters. Site surveys will be completed for the entire Tintic Project area, including all utility corridor and access roads. It is anticipated that all mining operations will avoid all currently identified potential jurisdictional waters within the area of the Project. Therefore, no permits or approvals from the ACOE are expected to be required.
County Conditional Use Permit and Other Permits. We have been proactive in maintaining good communication with the local community. To date, county officials as well as local landowners have expressed strong support for the Tintic Project. With this level of support for the Tintic Project, the CUP should be issued by Juab County without significant challenges. Anticipated time for approval would be 3-6 months once all the supporting studies have been completed.
Arizona — Santa Cruz Project
The Santa Cruz Project’s exploration and mining operations will be conducted entirely on private lands, and the planned mining operations will extract private mineral resources. Based on our assessment of federal and state law and regulations, the State of Arizona will be the lead permitting agency. Similar to Utah, the state of Arizona has been granted primacy of most of the major mining and environmental regulations applicable to the Santa Cruz Project, the primary exception being the federal underground injection control program. Several federal and state mining and environmental regulations will be applicable to the Santa Cruz Project depending on final design and operational details. These mining and environmental regulations may apply to exploration, reclamation, air, groundwater protection, natural resources, and development plans. We believe that there will be no federal nexus as it relates to permitting. Environmental studies will be conducted to fully assess and provide technical information on environmental conditions in order to support permit applications. Federal mineral claims do underlie one area adjacent to the planned mining area, but those properties are not currently in the mine plan.
Specific permits required for the Santa Cruz Project cannot be determined until the project design is completed. Specific information to be developed includes:
•Mine design
•Mining methods
•Mineral recovery methods
•Project water balance
•Process facility design
•Water requirements
•Infrastructure
•Surface facilities
•Reclamation methods
•Project emissions
The following table identifies the major permits and approvals that we will need to obtain either prior to the construction or before start-up of the mine and processing plant(s). The permits listed are not meant to be all-inclusive and cover only the major permits required for the mine and processing plant that are known at the current time.

Major Permits or Approvals | Issuing Agency 
Underground Injection Control Permit | U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
Dust Control and Air Quality Permits | Pinal County Air Quality Control District 
Aquifer Protection Permit | Arizona Department of Environmental Quality
AZPDES Industrial Stormwater Mining Multi-Sector General Permit | Arizona Department of Environmental Quality
Reclamation Plan Approval | Arizona State Mine Inspector 
Water Appropriation Permits | Arizona Department of Water Resources 

Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) Permit. A UIC permit is administered by Region 9 of the EPA under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act but the issuance of a UIC permit does not trigger NEPA. This federal permit would apply if the project were to inject fluids underground, as would be the case for in situ leach mining. A conventional underground mine that does not involve underground fluid injection would not require coverage under a UIC permit. The technical information to support a UIC application is extensive and requires significant data on subsurface geology and hydrology. Detailed design would be needed and much of the data requirements would overlap with the Arizona Aquifer Protection Permit (below).
Dust Control and Air Quality Permits. Emissions of fugitive dust caused by activities that disturb the soil, such as earthmoving, vehicular/equipment traffic on unpaved surfaces, project activities disturbing unpaved services and wind require a dust control permit from the Pinal County Air Quality Control District (“PCAQCD”). Dust caused by vehicles traveling on unpaved roads, construction and wind events create a type of air pollution called particulate matter. Rules and regulations have been adopted to limit the amount of particulate matter produced by certain types of activities. A permit application is being submitted through the online portal to cover the exploration activities. A separate dust control permit will be submitted for the commencement of mining operations.
As the project is anticipated to have the potential to create emissions of regulated air pollutants above a minimum threshold during the mining phase for the processing plants, a permit from PCAQCD must be obtained before construction begins. The permit application would identify emission sources, emission controls and other relevant information. Development of a dispersion model to estimate effects to background air quality from project emission may be required. The permitting process includes a 30-day public comment period, and the time needed by PCAQCD to complete the technical review depends on the complexity of the project. We anticipate the permit could be obtained within 12 months of application submittal but will be dependent on the category of permit needed and the agency backlog at the time of submittal.
Aquifer Protection Permit. During the exploration phase of the project, unlined water impoundments, such as drill sumps, will be constructed and be subject to an Aquifer Protection Permit (“APP”). General Permit 1.04 allows any discharge from a facility that receives water, drilling fluids, or drill cuttings from a well if the discharge is to the same aquifer in approximately the same location from which the water supply was originally withdrawn. During mine commercial operations, facilities will likely be required that are categorized by Arizona statute as discharging facilities and would require an APP Individual Permit. We anticipate that an Individual (as opposed to General) permit would be required and that a public hearing would be held. Technical information to support an APP application is extensive and requires that facility design be advanced to the point that the potential for impacts groundwater quality can be adequately assessed. Arizona Administrative Code R18-1-525 limits the time for a complex Individual APP with public hearing to 329 business days. This time could be extended if the application review identifies additional information that is required to be submitted or if agency backlog is high at the time of submittal. We anticipate being able to obtain this information within 18 months of developing the permit application.
AZPDES Industrial Stormwater Mining Multi-Sector General Permit (“MSGP”). A SWPPP must be prepared as outlined in the mining sector MSGP prior to receiving permit coverage. The drainage control plan developed as part of the mining and reclamation plan will be used to develop the SWPPP. The SWPPP must be fully developed and permit coverage granted prior to breaking ground at the site. A Notice of Intent to be covered under the mining MSGP will be submitted to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality through the online portal.
Reclamation Plan Approval. All surface facilities must be reclaimed and a reclamation plan must be developed to describe the methods and the schedule for reclamation. In addition, the costs for a third-party to complete the reclamation must be estimated. The reclamation plan and reclamation cost estimate must be provided to the Arizona Mine Inspector for approval, a process expected to take 120 days. Financial assurance must also be secured by means of a surety bond, certificate of deposit, cash deposit and corporate guarantee, to ensure that the funds are available to complete reclamation in the event of operator default.
Table of Contents

Water Appropriation Permits. We have acquired a substantial land package with associated water rights. Most of these rights authorize water use for irrigation or residential service connections, so administrative filings will likely be required to convert them to the proposed mining uses. We are also exploring other potential water rights sources in the area.
The foregoing is intended to identify the major, or long-lead time, permits and approvals, and is not exhaustive. Additional permits or authorizations will be required. However, additional permit requirements and approvals are not anticipated to require extensive technical detail or review and lengthy issuance timelines. 
These additional permits may include:
•Hazardous materials permits
•Solid or hazardous waste permits
•City/County zoning changes
•City/County building permits, utility permits, road access permits
•City/County Special Use permit or Development Plan approval
•Floodplain use permit
•Stormwater permit
•Septic or sewage treatment permit
•Onsite landfill permit
•Potable water system permit
•Threatened or endangered species consultation
•Cultural resources consultation
Numerous large mine operations have been permitted in Arizona, and specifically in Pinal County where the Santa Cruz Project is located. Given the prevalence of copper mining, these jurisdictions have developed regulatory programs that have well-defined permitting requirements and that are relatively predictable in terms of the permitting process and associated timelines.
Competition
There is aggressive competition within the mineral resources industry. We compete with other companies to acquire prospective mineral projects or to acquire, or stake, mineral titles. Many of these companies currently have greater resources than we do to be able to identify and evaluate prospective mineral projects or titles, and often have greater financial resources to be able to pursue their acquisition.
In addition, we also encounter competition for the hiring of key personnel whether as employees, consultants or other service providers. The mineral exploration and mining industry is currently facing a shortage of experienced mining professionals. Moreover, the demand for exploration equipment (including drilling rigs), technical consultants and assay labs is very high, and such personnel and services may not be available, or if they are, at costs that are greater than expected resulting in an increase in our costs. This competition affects us by increasing the time and cost to conduct exploration activities.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
We are required to comply with numerous other environmental laws, regulations and permits in addition to those discussed above. These additional requirements include, for example, various permits regulating road construction and drilling at our mineral projects. We endeavor to conduct our mining operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. However, because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations during mining operations occur from time to time in the industry.
Human Capital
We are committed to promoting the health, safety and well-being of our workforce and striving to further strengthen our commitment to promoting an inclusive and diverse workplace. We believe our workforce is the foundation of our success. Our Board of Directors oversees our policies and implementation programs that govern our approach to management of our human capital, with the Nominating and Compensation Committee having oversight of human capital

matters, including those relating to executive recruitment, retention and development, pay equity, and inclusion and diversity.
As of December 31, 2022, Ivanhoe Electric and its subsidiaries had 244 full time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
History, 2021 Reorganization and Financing
On April 30, 2021, HPX completed a restructuring whereby HPX contributed (i) all of the issued and outstanding shares of HPX’s subsidiaries, other than those holding direct or indirect interests in its Nimba Iron Ore Project; (ii) certain property, plant and equipment; and (iii) certain financial assets, in exchange for shares of our common stock. HPX then distributed the shares common stock to HPX stockholders by way of a dividend, with each HPX stockholder receiving one share of our common stock for each HPX share of common stock then held by the stockholder.
On April 30, 2021 we also entered into an intellectual property assignment and novation agreement with HPX, I-Pulse, and several subsidiary companies by which the rights to certain technology and patent license agreements previously held by HPX or a subsidiary, as licensee, were assigned to us.
Stapled Offering of Equity and Series 1 Convertible Notes.
Between August 3, 2021 and November 17, 2021, we and I-Pulse, issued and sold “bundles” of securities comprised of (i) an aggregate of 4,015,990 shares of our common stock at $2.49 per share, (ii) $49,999,200 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes convertible into shares of our common stock (“Convertible Notes”), and (iii) $19,999,680 aggregate principal amount of promissory notes issued by I-Pulse convertible into shares of our common stock held by I-Pulse (“I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes”). The securities comprising the bundles were immediately separable. As a result, we raised gross proceeds of $59,999,040. We did not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes.
Upon the consummation of our initial public offering, the Convertible Notes, including any accrued but unpaid interest, automatically converted into 5,419,923 shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to $9.39 per share of common stock.
Pursuant to the terms of the I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes, upon the consummation of our initial public offering, the I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes, including any accrued but unpaid interest, may be exchanged, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder, into shares of our common stock then held by I-Pulse at a price per share equal to $4.6929 per share of common stock, subject in each case to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, or similar transactions. The I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes are also convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity into shares of I-Pulse common stock. The I-Pulse Convertible PIK Notes mature on July 31, 2023. 
Series 2 Convertible Notes.
