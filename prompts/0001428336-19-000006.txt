Item 1. Business
Company overview 
We are a leader and an innovator in the high growth category of technology-enabled services platforms that empower consumers to make healthcare saving and spending decisions. Our platform provides an ecosystem where consumers can access their tax-advantaged healthcare savings, compare treatment options and pricing, evaluate and pay healthcare bills, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives, and make educated investment choices to grow their tax-advantaged healthcare savings. We can integrate with any health plan or banking institution to be the independent and trusted partner that enables consumers as they seek to manage, save and spend their healthcare dollars. We believe the secular shift to greater consumer responsibility for healthcare costs will require a significant portion of the approximately 191 million under-age 65 consumers with private health insurance in the United States to use a platform such as ours.
The core of our ecosystem is the health savings account, or HSA, a financial account through which consumers spend and save long term for healthcare on a tax-advantaged basis. We refer to the HSAs for which we serve as custodian as our HSA Members. As of January 31, 2019, we were the integrated HSA platform for 141 health, retirement and other benefit plan providers and for employees at more than 45,000 employer clients. Our customers include individuals, employers of all sizes, and health, retirement, and other benefit plan providers. We refer to our individual customers as our members, our health, retirement and other benefit plan provider customers as our Health Plan and Administrator Partners and our employer clients as our Employer Partners. Our Health Plan and Administrator Partners and Employer Partners collectively constitute our Network Partners. As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 4.0 million HSAs on our platform. Management estimates that this represents approximately 8.8 million lives. During the years ended January 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we added approximately 679,000, 723,000 and 703,000 new HSA Members, representing approximately 1.5 million, 1.6 million and 1.5 million lives, respectively. 
We have developed technology and a differentiated focus on the consumer to facilitate the transition to a more consumer-centric approach to healthcare saving and spending. Our solution is deployed as a cloud-based platform that is accessible to our customers through the Internet and on mobile devices and is hosted on private servers, which allows us to scale on demand. Core to our technology is a configurable framework and open platform that we believe provides us greater functionality and flexibility than generic technologies used by our legacy competitors and requires less investment and time to configure and customize to our customers’ needs. 
We are able to seamlessly integrate third-party applications into our platform, which has afforded us an advantage in an expanding consumer healthcare landscape. A growing number of companies are attempting to integrate into the consumer's daily healthcare spending experience by leveraging our platform. These companies offer functions such as price transparency, benefits enrollment, population health, wellness, analytics, health insurance and investment services, and are looking to reach the consumer at the critical "save" and "spend" moment. In an effort to capitalize on this opportunity, we continue to expand the number of ecosystem partners with whom our platform is integrated. 
Our business model provides strong visibility into our future operating performance. As of the beginning of the past several fiscal years, we had approximately 90% visibility into the revenue of the subsequent fiscal year. We earn monthly service revenue primarily through contracts with our Network Partners and our custodial agreements with individual members. We earn custodial revenue from custodial cash assets deposited with our federally-insured custodial depository partners and with our insurance company partner. In addition, we earn recordkeeping fees on assets held with our investments partner and we earn fees for investment advisory services through our registered investment advisor subsidiary. We also earn interchange revenue, which is primarily interchange fees charged to merchants on payments made with our cards via payment networks. Monthly service revenue, custodial revenue, and interchange revenue are recurring in nature, providing strong visibility into our future business.

Our products and services
Healthcare saving and spending platform. We offer a cloud-based platform, accessed by our members online via a desktop or mobile device, through which individuals can make health saving and spending decisions, pay healthcare bills, compare treatment options and prices, receive personalized benefit and clinical information, earn wellness incentives, grow their savings and make investment choices. The platform provides users with access to services we provide as well as services provided by third parties selected by us or by our Network Partners.
Among other features, the platform includes the capability to present to users medical bills upon adjudication by a health plan, including details such as the amount paid by insurance, specific nature of the medical service provided, and diagnostic code. Users of the platform can pay these bills from an account of ours or from any bank account, online, via a mobile device, or using our payment card. All users of the platform gain access to our healthcare consumer specialists, available every hour of every day, via a toll-free telephone number or email. Our specialists can assist users with such tasks as contacting a medical provider to dispute a bill, negotiating a payment schedule, optimizing the use of tax-advantaged accounts to reduce medical spending or selecting from among medical plans offered by an employer or health plan.
Health savings accounts. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created HSAs, a tax-exempt trust or custodial account managed by a custodian that is a bank, an insurance company, or a non-bank custodian specifically authorized by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, as meeting certain ownership, capitalization, expertise and governance requirements. We are an IRS approved non-bank custodian of our members' HSAs, designated to serve as both a passive and non-passive non-bank custodian of HSAs. 
To be eligible to contribute to an HSA, an individual must be covered under a high deductible healthcare plan, or HDHP, have no additional health coverage, not be enrolled in Medicare, and not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return. HSAs have several tax-advantaged benefits, which we call the "triple tax savings": (1) individuals can claim a tax deduction for contributions they make to their HSAs, and contributions that their employers make to their HSAs may be excluded from their gross income for purposes of federal and most state income and employment tax; (2) the interest or earnings on the assets in the account, including reinvestment, accumulate without being subject to tax; and (3) distributions may be tax free if they are used to pay qualified medical expenses. There is no requirement to provide receipts to us to substantiate HSA distributions to members, whether made through our payment card or directly from our online platform. Additionally, taxable distributions other than for qualified medical expenses are permitted without penalty (although subject to income tax) after age 65. Balances remain in the account until used, i.e., there is no “use or lose” requirement. An HSA is owned by the account holder; it remains the account holder’s property upon a change of employment, health plan or retirement.
Investment platform and advisory services. We offer a mutual fund investment platform and an online-only automated investment advisory service to all of our members whose account balances exceed a stated threshold. These services are entirely elective to the member. The advisory service is delivered through a web-based tool, AdvisorTM, which is offered and managed by HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, our SEC-registered investment adviser subsidiary. HealthEquity Advisors, LLC provides investment advice to its clients exclusively through the AdvisorTM tool on an interactive website. Members who utilize our mutual fund investment platform or subscribe for AdvisorTM services pay asset-based fees, which include the cost of the advisory service and all trading commissions and other expenses associated with transactions made through these online tools. 
AdvisorTM provides investment education guidance and management, including maintaining HSA cash (liquidity) in amounts directed by the member, targeting risk appropriate portfolio diversification, and mutual fund selection. 
We offer three levels of service to investors:

• | Self-driven: For members who do not subscribe for AdvisorTM, we provide a mutual fund investment platform to invest HSA balances. Neither we nor AdvisorTM provides advice to members in respect of investments among funds on the platform;


• | GPS: AdvisorTM provides guidance and advice, but the member makes the final investment decisions and implements portfolio allocation and investment advice through the HealthEquity platform; and


• | Auto-pilot: AdvisorTM manages the account and implements portfolio allocation and investment advice automatically for the member.

Regardless of the level of service selected, members are responsible for their proportionate share of fees and expenses payable by the underlying mutual funds and other investment vehicles in which they invest. 
Reimbursement arrangements. Reimbursement arrangements, or RAs, include health reimbursement arrangements, or HRAs, and flexible spending arrangements, or FSAs. An RA may be administered by any third-
-3-

party administration, or TPA, firm. Most HSA custodians are not TPAs, and most TPAs are not HSA custodians. We are among only a few firms that are able to administer HSAs and RAs on the same technology platform. 
RAs are employer sponsored accounts that employees can use to reimburse qualified medical or dependent care expenses. Before payment can be made, expenses must be substantiated using electronic claims from a health plan, data gleaned from operation of our payment card where permitted, or submission of receipts or other documentation by the employee. Like HSAs, amounts allocated to RAs and reimbursements from RAs may be excluded from employees’ gross income for federal and most state income and employment tax purposes. RAs are not portable, however; any value remaining upon termination of employment is forfeited (subject to COBRA). In addition, FSAs are subject to “use or lose” restrictions that limit to $500 the amount that may be rolled over from year to year. As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately 572,000 RAs on our platform. 
HealthEquity retirement. Through our subsidiary HealthEquity Retirement Services, LLC, we offer ERISA plan administration and investment services (with partnered advisors and record keepers) that can help reduce the cost, risk, and work of managing a 401(k) or similar retirement plan. In addition to these plan services, we are able to connect third party retirement solutions to our HSA platform, allowing users to manage their HSA and 401(k) balances from a single convenient dashboard, with a common set of investment options to enhance financial literacy and help optimize health and wealth savings. 
Our technology
Our proprietary technology is deployed as a cloud-based solution that is accessible to customers through the web and mobile devices. We utilize a multi-tenant architecture that allows changes made for one Network Partner to be extended to all others. This architecture provides operating leverage by reducing costs and improving efficiencies, enabling us to maximize the utilization of our infrastructure capacity with a reduction in required maintenance. We are increasing investment in our technology and communications systems to support new opportunities and enhance security, privacy, and platform infrastructure. During the years ended January 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized software development costs of $9.3 million, $8.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $13.7 million, $12.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, in software development costs primarily related to the post-implementation and operation stages of our proprietary software. 
Our solution is hosted on a virtual private cloud with an ability to scale on demand. This allows us to quickly support our current and projected growth. We utilize two redundant third-party data centers to ensure continuous access and data availability. The data centers are purpose-built facilities for hosting mission critical systems with multiple built-in redundancy layers to minimize service disruptions and meet industry-standard measures.
Due to the sensitive nature of our customers’ data, we have a heightened focus on data security and protection. We have implemented industry-standard processes, policies and tools through all levels of our software development and network administration, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities in our system.
Our competitive landscape
We view our competition in terms of direct and indirect competitors. Our direct competitors are HSA custodians that include state or federally chartered banks, insurance companies and non-bank trustees approved by the IRS as meeting certain ownership, capitalization, expertise and governance requirements. Our indirect competitors are benefits administration and payment technology and service providers that work with other HSA custodians to market to health plans and/or employers.
We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for technology platforms that empower healthcare consumers are: integration with the broader healthcare system; level of consumer education and support; breadth of product offering; flexibility of technology to meet partner requirements; brand strength and reputation; and price. We believe that many of our large financial competitors may view their HSA businesses as non-core and have historically under-invested in developing these businesses. Many of our competitors have not incorporated personal health information into their offerings, as this would require significant upfront investment in technology, training, and segregation of business operations from other bank or custodial operations, as well as integration with data sources such as health plans and pharmacy benefits managers. We believe competitors within the technology, payments or benefits administration service provider sector are limited from expanding their presence in this area due to regulatory requirements for capital adequacy and demonstrated expertise in custodial operations. However, we experience significant competition from banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions that have greater resources than us, and the intensity of competition may increase over time.

Our competitive strengths
We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the transformation of the healthcare benefits market. Our platform is aligned with a healthcare environment that rewards consumer engagement and fosters an integrated consumer experience.
Leadership and first-mover advantage. We have established a defensible leadership position in the HSA industry through our first-mover advantage, focus on innovation and differentiated capabilities. Our leadership position is evidenced by the tripling of our market share (measured by custodial assets), from 4% in December 2010 to 13% in December 2018, as noted by the 2018 Devenir HSA Research Report, which indicates we are the second largest HSA custodian by market share measured by custodial assets.
Complete solution for managing consumer healthcare saving and spending. Our members utilize our platform in a number of ways and in varying frequencies. For example, our members utilize our platform to evaluate and pay healthcare bills through the member portal, which allows members to pay their healthcare providers, receive reimbursements and learn of savings opportunities for prescription drugs. Members also utilize the platform’s mobile app to view and pay claims on-the-go, including uploading medical and insurance documentation to the platform with their mobile phone cameras. During the year ended January 31, 2019, our platform experienced 40.3 million logons and, on average, every month 21% of our members signed into our platform.
Proprietary and integrated technology platform. We have a proprietary cloud-based technology platform, developed and refined during more than a decade of operations, which we believe is highly differentiated in the marketplace for a number of key reasons:

• | Purpose-built technology: Our platform was designed specifically to serve the needs of healthcare consumers, health plans and employers. We believe it provides greater functionality and flexibility than the technologies used by our competitors, many of which were originally developed for banking, benefits administration or retirement services. We believe we are one of few providers with a platform that encompasses all of the core functionality of healthcare saving and spending in a single secure and compliant system, including custodial administration of individual savings and investment accounts, card and electronic funds transaction processing, benefits enrollment and eligibility, electronic and paper medical claims processing, medical bill presentment, tax-advantaged reimbursement account and health incentive administration, HSA trust administration, online investment advice and sophisticated analytics. 


• | Data integration: Our technology platform allows us to integrate data from disparate sources, which enables us to seamlessly incorporate personal health information, clinical insight and individually tailored strategies into the consumer experience. We currently have more than 3,000 distinct integrations with health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, employers and other benefits provider systems. Many of our partners’ systems rely on custom data models, non-standard formats, complex business rules and security protocols that are difficult or expensive to change. 


• | Configurability: Our flexible technology platform enables us to create a unique solution for each of our Network Partners. For example, a HealthEquity team member can readily configure more than 270 product attributes, including integration with a partner’s chosen healthcare price transparency or wellness tools, single sign on, sales and broker support sites, branding, member communication, custom fulfillment and payment card, savings options and interest rates, fees and mutual fund investment choices. We currently have more than 1,700 unique partner configurations of our offerings in use. 

Differentiated consumer experience. We have designed our solutions and support services to deliver a differentiated consumer experience, which is a function of our culture and technology. We believe this provides a significant competitive advantage relative to legacy competitors whom we believe prioritize transaction processing and benefits administration.

• | Culture: We call our culture “DEEP Purple,” which we define as driving excellence, ethics, and process while providing remarkable service. Our DEEP Purple culture is a significant factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and to address nimbly opportunities in the rapidly changing healthcare sector. 


• | Technology: Our technology helps us to deliver on our commitment to DEEP Purple. We tailor the content of our platform and the guidance of our experts to be timely, personal and relevant to each member. For example, our technology generates health savings strategies that are delivered to our members when they interact with our platform or call us. We employ individuals, which we refer to as Member Education Specialists, who provide real-time assistance to our members via telephone, email, or chat.

• | Customer service and education: As a key part of our strategy and commitment to DEEP Purple, our team members work directly with our Network Partners to engage with consumers, educating them about the benefits of our HSAs and our other products and providing personalized guidance. 

We believe our DEEP Purple culture drives our success. Our commitment to DEEP Purple has been rewarded with consumer loyalty scores that far exceed those of most banks and traditional health insurers. 
Large and diversified channel access. We believe our differentiated distribution platform provides a competitive advantage by efficiently enabling us to reach a growing consumer market. Our platform is built on a business-to-business-to-consumer, or B2B2C, channel strategy, whereby we rely on our Network Partners to reach consumers instead of marketing our services to these potential members directly. Reaching the consumer is critical in order for us to increase the number of our HSA Members. 
We work directly with our Network Partners to reach the consumer in various ways. Our Health Plan and Administrator Partners collectively employ thousands of sales representatives and account managers who promote both the Health Plan and Administrators Partner’s health insurance products, such as HDHPs, and our HSAs. Our Employer Partners collectively employ thousands of human resources professionals who are tasked with explaining the benefits of our HSAs to their employees. Our sales and account management teams work with and train the sales representatives and account management teams and the human resource professionals of our Network Partners on the benefits of enrolling in, contributing to, and saving and spending through our HSAs, and our Network Partners then convey these benefits to prospective members. As a result of this collaboration, we develop relationships with each member who enrolls in an HSA with us. This personalized engagement with our members constitutes our B2B2C channel strategy.
Scalable operating model. We believe that our technology is scalable because our products and services are accessed primarily through our technology platform, which is cloud based. After initial on-boarding and a period of education, our service costs for any given customer typically decline over time. Our opportunity to earn high-margin revenue from existing HSA Members grows over time because our HSA Members’ balances typically grow, increasing custodial revenue without significant incremental cost to us. 
Strong customer retention rates. Retention of our HSA Members has been strong over time. Individually owned trust accounts, including HSAs, have inherently high switching costs, as switching requires a certain amount of effort on the part of the account holder and may result in closure fees. We believe that our retention rates are also high due to our technology platform’s integration with the broader healthcare system used by our HSA Members and our customer engagement and focus on the consumer experience. 
Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. We have a successful history of acquiring HSA portfolios and businesses that strengthen our platform. We expect to continue this growth strategy and regularly evaluate opportunities. We have developed an internal capability to source, evaluate and integrate acquisitions that have created value for shareholders. We believe the nature of our competitive landscape provides significant acquisition opportunities. Many of our competitors view their HSA businesses as non-core functions. We believe they may look to divest these assets and, in certain cases, be limited from making acquisitions due to depository capital requirements. 
Government regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations.
IRS regulations
We are subject to applicable IRS regulations, which lay the foundation for tax savings and eligible expenses under the HSAs, HRAs and FSAs we administer. The IRS issues guidance regarding these regulations regularly. In addition, we are subject to conflict of interest and other prohibited transaction rules that are enforced through excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code. Although the excise taxes are enforced by the IRS, the underlying rules are promulgated by the Department of Labor. 
In February 2006, HealthEquity, Inc. received designation by the U.S. Department of Treasury to act as a passive non-bank custodian, which allows HealthEquity, Inc. to hold custodial assets for individual account holders.  In July 2017, HealthEquity, Inc. received designation by the U.S. Department of Treasury to act as both a passive and non-passive non-bank custodian, which allows HealthEquity, Inc. to hold custodial assets for individual account holders and use discretion to direct investment of such assets held. As a passive and non-passive non-bank custodian, the Company must maintain net worth (assets minus liabilities) greater than 2% of passive custodial funds held at each calendar year-end and 4% of the non-passive custodial funds held at each calendar year-end in order to take on 
-6-

additional custodial assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's year-end for trust and tax purposes, the net worth of the Company exceeded the required thresholds.
Privacy and data security regulations
In the provision of HSA custodial services and directed TPA services for RAs, we are subject to the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act), and similar state laws.
GLBA imposes financial privacy and security requirements on financial institutions that relate to the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of an account holder’s nonpublic personal information. Nonpublic personal information includes information that is collected or generated in the course of offering a financial product or service. For example, nonpublic personal information includes information submitted by a prospective account holder in an application, an account holder’s name and contact information, and transaction information. Because part of our business is the administration of financial products such as HSAs, we are required under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s financial privacy rule under GLBA to send a notice of privacy practices to account holders and to comply with restrictions on the disclosure of nonpublic personal information to non-affiliated third parties. We are also required under GLBA to establish reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of nonpublic personal information pursuant to the Federal Trade Commission’s safeguards rule. Violations of GLBA can result in civil and criminal penalties.
HIPAA covered entities and their business associates are required to adhere to HIPAA privacy and security standards. Covered entities include most healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. Because we perform services (such as RA services) for covered entities that include processing protected health information, we are a business associate and subject to HIPAA. The two rules that most significantly affect our business are: (i) the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, or the Privacy Rule; and (ii) the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, or the Security Rule. The Privacy Rule restricts the use and disclosure of protected health information, and requires us to safeguard that information and provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information. The Security Rule establishes requirements for safeguarding protected health information transmitted or stored electronically. Both civil and criminal penalties apply for violating HIPAA, which may be enforced by both the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights and state attorneys general. Violations of HIPAA may also subject us to contractual remedies under the terms of agreements with covered entities. 
States also have laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on our collection, storage, and use of personally identifiable information. Privacy regulation has become a priority issue in many states, including California, which in 2018 enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act broadly regulating California residents’ personal information and providing California residents with various rights to access and control their data.
ERISA
Our private-sector clients’ FSAs, HRAs, and 401(k) and other account-based retirement plans are covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, or ERISA, which governs “employee benefits plans.” Title I of ERISA does not generally apply to HSAs. ERISA generally imposes extensive reporting requirements on employers, as well as an obligation to provide various disclosures to covered employees and beneficiaries; and employers and third-party administrators that have authority or discretion over management, administration, or investment of plan assets are subject to fiduciary responsibility under ERISA. ERISA's requirements affect our RA and 401(k) businesses, including HealthEquity Retirement Services, LLC. The Department of Labor can bring enforcement actions or assess penalties against employers, investment advisers, administrators, and other service providers for failing to comply with ERISA’s requirements. Participants and beneficiaries may also file lawsuits against employers, investment advisers, administrators, and other service providers under ERISA.
Department of Labor
The Department of Labor, or the DOL, regulates plans that are subject to ERISA, including health FSAs, HRAs, and 401(k) and other retirement plans. The DOL also issues guidance related to fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transactions under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code that affect administration of HSAs (as well as health FSAs, HRAs, and retirement plans). 
The DOL issues regulations, technical releases and other guidance that apply to employee benefit plans and tax-favored savings arrangements (including HSAs) generally. In addition, in response to a request by an individual or an organization, the DOL’s Employee Benefits Security Administration may issue an advisory opinion that interprets 
-7-

and applies ERISA and/or corresponding prohibited transaction rules under the Internal Revenue Code to a specific situation, including issues related to consumer-centric healthcare accounts and retirement plans. 
Healthcare reform
In March 2010, the federal government enacted significant reforms to healthcare benefits through the Affordable Care Act. The legislation amended various provisions in many federal laws, including the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA. The reforms included new excise taxes that incentivize employers to provide health benefits (including HSA-compatible benefits) to all full-time employees and new coverage mandates for health plans. The new rules directly affect health FSAs and HRAs and have an indirect effect on HSAs. Further changes to the Affordable Care Act and related healthcare regulation remain under consideration. 
Investment Advisers Act of 1940
Our subsidiary HealthEquity Advisors, LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser that provides web-only automated investment advisory services to members. As an SEC-registered adviser, it must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Advisers Act, and related Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, regulations and is subject to periodic inspections by the SEC staff. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the adviser and its clients, and general anti-fraud prohibitions. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines or other similar consequences.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property is important to our success. We have registered our trademark “HealthEquity” with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and maintain trademark rights to the mark “Building Health Savings.”
We also rely on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary processes, and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our team members and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our team members and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement while using our property or which relate to our business.
Geographic areas
Our sole geographic market is the U.S.
Employees
We refer to our employees as our team members. As of January 31, 2019, we had 1,141 team members, including 766 in service delivery, 175 in technology and development and 200 in sales and marketing, general and administrative. We consider our relationship with our team members to be good. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
