As can be seen from the table above, a substantial portion of the Company's revenue comes from the sale of FRP products. FRP products are highly sought after by our customers due to:


· | The material's lightweight coupled with high strength. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The material's ability to be a good electrical insulator with no electro-magnetic behavior and no electric spark. 
· | The material's rust-free nature and resistance to acid, alkali, organic dissolvents, and other gas and liquid mixtures.
· | The material's resistance to aging with more than 20 years of useful life under normal working conditions. 
· | The material's ease of maintenance. 

Chemical Raw Material Product Examples

Listed below are some examples of FRP chemical raw material products the company sells. In addition, there are both general purpose and more specific use case materials. 

Polyester Resin SHCP 268 SHCP 268 is a thixotropic, quick-curing unsaturated polyester resin suitable as a general-purpose resin. It can be used in generally all FRP products. However, it might not suffice depending on the customer’s needs since it might not have the required structural integrity, chemical resistance, or UV resistance properties a customer requires for their products. For example, one of the ways this material has been used is in the construction of train seats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polyester Resin 9509 This is a premium raw material compared to Polyester Resin SHCP 268 and is priced higher. Like Polyester Resin SHCP 268, it is a general-purpose material but provides more structural integrity and is longer lasting. Customers have used this material to produce marine boats and water slides

Our Chemical Raw Material Suppliers

We consider our major vendors in each period to be those vendors that accounted for more than 10% of overall purchases in such period. We had four suppliers accounted for 15.56%, 14.82%, 14.81% and 12.18 of the Company’s total chemical raw material purchase, respectively. We had four major vendors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, who collectively accounted for 57.37% of total purchases. We had four major vendors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, who collectively accounted for 64.11% of total purchases. We purchase from a variety of suppliers and believe these raw materials are widely available. If we were unable to purchase from our primary suppliers, we do not expect we would face difficulties in locating another supplier at substantially the same price. We have secure and efficient access to all the raw materials necessary to produce customers’ products saving them the trouble of sourcing from several distributors. We believe our relationships with the suppliers of these raw materials are strong. While the prices of such raw materials may vary greatly from time to time, we believe we could hedge such risk by adjusting our price or absorb the higher cost at times if necessary.

Quality Control Policies

We have a strict quality control process centered around the handling, storage, and expiry dates of our chemical raw materials before they are delivered to our customers. All products supplied by us are attached with a Certificate of Analysis ("COA") issued by manufacturers. COA contains the batch numbers, test result data, and manufacturing date. There are also labels on the packaging of our products stating the production date and batch number. 
Competition

Based on the information provided by our customers and suppliers, Malaysia's industrial chemical market size is approximately USD 50 million per annum, and our current market share is around 20% of the domestic market. In the wider Southeast Asian region, including Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, and Cambodia, we rely on close relationships with our distributors to distribute our product to customers. As a result, the market size of the Southeast Asian market is USD 500 million per annum, and our current market share is around 2.0% of the Southeast Asian market. 

As Chemrex's clients are primarily in Malaysia, we consider Chemrex's principal competitors to be in the Malaysian domestic market for selling chemical raw materials. Chemex's competitors include Kaliba Sdn.Bhd. ("Kaliba"), Myeast Sdn.Bhd. and RP Product Sdn.Bhd. Some of these competitors, such as Kaliba, may have greater resources than us. They are leading providers of Fibreglass reinforced materials such as Polyester Resin, Chopped Strand Mat, and Woven Roving, many of which overlap with our product offerings.

Additionally, most of the chemical raw materials we distribute are made to industry standard specifications and either produced by or available from multiple sources. Our suppliers may also distribute directly or through multiple chemical distributors. Even for products that are unique in formulation or other characteristics, there are typically other products available that are functional substitutes, such as natural plant fiber green products, such that we face significant competition even where we are the exclusive distributors of a specialty product. Hence, our suppliers may also choose to limit their distribution outsourcing, particularly with respect to higher margin products, or to partner with other wholesalers or resellers for distribution, which could increase competition. 

Competitive Advantages

Notwithstanding the competition, we are a well-established and reliable quality composite material distributor with professional services. In addition, we offer the following benefits to our existing and potential customers:

· | Technical Expertise: Our technical staff, comprising two chemists and one engineer, are highly competent and familiar with the technical advancements in the FRP industry. They provide technical know-how on mixing various products and offer product suggestions or modifications to our customers, which may involve strengthening or enhancing existing products sold by our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Pricing Advantage: As a prominent reseller of FRP products in the domestic market with significant market share, we distribute our products at a relatively higher volume than our competitors. Hence, we enjoy the discounts we order from our suppliers in bulk which we then pass on to our customers. As a result, prospective customers could incur higher prices if they purchase from our competitors who do not transact at such a high volume.
· | Convenience: We provide a wide variety of over 100 FRP products. In contrast, some of our competitors might have a smaller product range. In addition, prospective customers could incur higher logistics if they purchase from many different sellers instead of relying on us as a one stop shop for all their business needs. 
· | Sourcing New Raw Materials for product development: We source a broad range of raw materials worldwide. This global reach greatly expands our potential customers and provides more opportunities for our customers to develop new products from a greater variety of raw materials. 


Growth strategy 

The composite raw materials market is expected to reach an estimated $40.2 billion by 2024 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2019 to 2024. Furthermore, the composites end-user market is expected to reach an estimated $114.7 billion by 2024. The major drivers for growth in this market are the increasing demand for lightweight materials in the aerospace, defense, and automotive industries. Also, corrosion and chemical resistance materials are in demand in the construction and pipe and water tank industries. With our wide variety of product offerings, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this increase in chemical composite market demand.

Product Liability

Due to the nature of Chemrex's business, we may face claims for product liability resulting from any environmental or personal injury because of the chemical raw materials sold by Chemrex. We currently do not hold any insurance should a claim arise.
Diagnostics Business

Through our subsidiary BGL, we also engaged in applying genomic testing to enable early disease diagnosis and health management.  

BGL's principal office address is Unit 02, Level 10, Tower B, Avenue 3, The Vertical Business Suite II, Bangsar South, 8 Jalan Kerinchi, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Our molecular genomic lab is located at Lab 353, Chemical Science Centre, University Science Malaysia, George Town, Penang, Malaysia, and we have a colon cancer and infectious diseases screening lab located at 4th floor, Lifecare Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. BGL's telephone number is (+60) 1221-26512 and website is www.bionexusgenelab.com. 

Our Non-invasive Blood Tests

At BGL, we focus on developing and marketing safe, effective, and non-invasive blood tests to detect diseases in their early stages to minimize treatment costs and improve patient outcomes. Our non-invasive blood tests analyze changes in ribonucleic acid ("RNA") to detect specific risks and intricate of individuals' health conditions for eight cancers (nasopharyngeal, lung, liver, stomach, breast, cervical, prostate, and colon), two inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and crohn's) and osteoarthritis. In addition, heart attack, stroke, and mental disorders risk screening have also been included as of 2023/2024. To increase accuracy, we believe that genomic screening can be utilized in conjunction with conventional procedures for disease detection, such as imaging and biopsies. 

We derive our revenue through screening patient samples utilizing the certain biomarkers we developed. We do not collect samples ourselves but rather market our screening service to healthcare providers, such as doctors, laboratories, and hospitals that collect the samples. BioNexus is the only commercial molecular lab in Malaysia that detects cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and osteoarthritis risk via RNA with a certified GeneChip from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). Our screening process can also help guide personalized medicines and therapies for individual patients according to their needs and risks.

Development of Screening Process

BGL's co-founder, late Dr. Choong-Chin Liew, developed and tested a novel approach in blood-based genomic analysis and screening by identifying biomarkers in Ribonucleic acid (RNA). Dr. Liew's research has determined that communication occurs between cells in blood and tissue as blood circulates throughout the body and subtle changes occur in cells communication occurs when a person suffers from an injury or disease. These cell-cell interactions induce manifest themselves in blood gene expression. Clinical studies performed by Dr. Liew and others have demonstrated that blood gene expression profiles can be used to develop personalized signatures capable of differentiating diseased patients from healthy ones. 

We take advantage of profiling these changes, which enables us to identify unique molecular signatures (biomarkers) reflecting disease activity which can then be used to develop disease-specific molecular diagnostic assays. We use these biomarkers as the basis for screening tests for early disease detection and generate revenue from providing screening services. 

The Screening Process

Our screening services begin with a blood sample from the patient. We do not conduct sample collection ourselves. Rather, a nurse or health care provider phlebotomist will draw 2.5 ml of blood from patients using an Paxgene tube. The blood and a completed company Blood Withdrawal Card are then sent to our lab via a third-party courier service. 

A copy of the company form is shown below.

All blood samples delivered to us are labeled with the patient's name, personal identity number, and laboratory reference number on the tube where the blood sample is maintained for safekeeping.


11


At our lab, the patient's RNA is extracted from the sample in a biosafety cabinet, followed by microcentrifuge and spectrophotometer to check the spectrophotometric concentration and quality of the extracted RNA. The RNA is purified, and biotinylated RNA will be mixed with purification beads and transferred to a U-bottom 96-well plate. Then, the plate will be placed onto a magnetic ring stand where labeled cRNA will be captured. The remaining solution will be removed, and the captured pellet will be cleaned-up to obtain cRNA with high purity. Then, purified cRNA will be fragmented for hybridization) and hybridized onto a genechip (we utilize the GeneChip 3' IVT PLUS Reagent Kit to prepare the biotinylated target from purified total RNA samples suitable for hybridization to GeneChip arrays). Double-stranded cDNA will be synthesized from the total RNA using reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primers. An in-vitro transcription (IVT) reaction is then done to produce biotin-labeled cRNA from the cDNA (16 hours incubation) and scanned through the Affymetrix station. Once the overnight hybridization is completed, the Genechips will be washed with dedicated buffers and solutions to remove excess cRNAs and hybridization solutions. Washed chips will be stained with staining buffers to illuminate attached cRNAs. Specific experimental information is defined using AMDS software on a PC-compatible workstation. Stained chips are ready for scanning. The chips will be transferred into the scanner, and the image will be processed into data files. The data collected from microarray analysis are analyzed using our propriety software and algorithm to generate the disease risk score report for the individual patient. 

Our software generates a report, which we forward to the healthcare provider for further consultation with the patient. This report can be used by the patient and the patient's physician to plan future tests and therapies and contains. The diagram below details the diagnostics and recommendations the report provided based on the screening results. 

The process for effectuating RNA analysis depicted in the picture below.


12


The raw data obtained will be analyzed and quality control processed by our lab in Malaysia using proprietary software to calculate the risk analysis of 11 different diseases. We simplify the result into a graph which is contained in the patient booklet provided to the health care professional. A sample graph is depicted below. 


In the above chart, NPC is Nasopharyngeal Cancer, ATDS is Ascending, Transverse, Descending, and Sigmoid Colon Cancer, and OA is Osteoarthritis.

The following cautionary text is contained in the results booklet the Company provides to the healthcare provider and each patient. The results booklet contains recommendations to assist with a physician's final diagnosis and treatment plan and is not meant to be medical advice. Below is the disclaimer that is included in each result booklet.

This report/screening is not intended or implied as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnostics, or treatment. The content, including text, graphics, and information in the report, illustrates the risk score only. BioNexus Gene Lab Sdn. Bhd. makes no representation and assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the information, as such information and contents are subject to change without notice. You are encouraged to review any medical condition or treatment with your doctor.


13


The key proprietary aspect of our process is our algorithm software, biomarkers, and the RNA extraction, preservation, quality control, hybridization, and data analysis processes developed by Dr. Liew. We acquired the software and the technological processes in June 2017. First, the gene expression from a reference population representing a specific disease condition is filtered using a quality assurance process based on repeatability data. Our proprietary algorithm software then analyzes this collected data and processes checked by the laboratory manager to ensure all the steps are followed in the deriving predictive model for each disease condition. Once these models have been established, they can be applied to the data from a new sample to make risk predictions for this individual. Each disease/disorder has a similar group of diseased/disordered genes identified through the Company's years of research and clinical trials in Malaysia.

Customer Service and Quality Control Policies

We envision this division of our business to provide high-quality screening tests. Our competitive advantage lies in our turnaround time, expert interpretation, and easy-to-understand reports with timely clinical decision-making. In addition, the company is dedicated to continuous quality improvement in our services and is committed to sensitivity and specificity priorities on each test.

We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality of patient information and to compliance with all privacy, security, and electronic transaction requirements of the Health Medical Act and Regulations and Code of Professional Conduct of the Malaysian Medical Council. Third parties requesting results, including any requests directly from the patient, are directed to the ordering facility. A copy of our screening test report includes reference ranges, interpretive comments, and footnotes. We submit test results electronically to healthcare providers, individual clients, and/or the Malaysian Health Ministry (HHS) regarding reportable diseases. Clients are responsible for compliance with CDC-specific statutes concerning reportable conditions. Patient test results are retained indefinitely.

All samples handled by our laboratory are treated as though they are infectious. The greatest dangers to healthcare workers exposed to blood and body fluids are hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV viruses. Our laboratory turnaround time is monitored closely and compared to standardized laboratory metrics for continuous quality improvement. Laboratory scientists and technologists are all highly experienced in handling complex tests. Dr. Stephen Ponnampalam, the Chief Technology Officer, and our supervisors monitor performance indicators for all laboratory services. Performance improvement initiatives are regularly instituted and reviewed as part of an ongoing quality improvement program.

Business Development and Growth Strategy

In April 2017, we began marketing our screening services to healthcare providers, laboratories, and hospitals, all of which have licensed doctors or staff. As mentioned above, our screening service provides a risk analysis report of 11 diseases, of which eight are different forms of cancer. However, in Malaysia, the cost of the analysis is not covered by health insurance. Thus, patients are required to pay out of pocket for our services, which currently range from $200 for a single colon cancer screening to $975 for all 11 diseases under BGS screening based on the request of the patient/healthcare provider. 

In November 2017, we expanded our marketing efforts to companies, business organizations, and insurance agents. As a result of these efforts, during November and December 2017, we entered arrangements with two companies in Kuala Lumpur to screen their employees for 11 diseases/disorders (lung cancer, colon cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis & Crohn’s disease), and osteoarthritis pursuant to which each company paid us $50,000. We completed the screening process of these two companies in the first quarter of 2019 and continue to market our services to other local companies in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. In 2022, we had entered an arrangement with a clinical lab to conduct screening for the 11 diseases.


14


Our pricing strategy is consistent with BGL's objectives, costs, competition, and demand for the product. BGL's management administers the policies to match the market needs. BGL plans to charge the following prices to individuals for its tests.


· | $200 for Colon Cancer Screening (Single Colon Cancer screening per blood sample) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | $975 for Blood-based Genomic Signature (BGS) Screening for 11 diseases/disorders (Molecular RNA Cancer Screening per blood sample)


The price for each test charged to hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare operators is subject to an incentive-based rebate that ranges from 20% to 25% based on the monthly volume of tests conducted. 

As of October 15, 2021, we work with 27 liquid biopsy sample collection centers, 12 in Klang Valley (comprised of our capital city Kuala Lumpur) and towns on the northern and southern fringes of the capital city), and 15 public hospitals and labs nationwide. These 27 locations account for approximately 90% of our patient population in 2022 and 2021. 

We aim to have more healthcare providers in the Klang Valley referring patients to us for screening protocol. Once we have established our brand and reputation in Klang Valley, we will expand to other large cities in Malaysia. On August 25, 2022, we presented our mRNA screening service to the Health Ministry of Malaysia for nationwide implementation. Deputy Director Generals from Public Health and Cancer Divisions had scheduled another meeting  on January 17, 2023. In the January’ meeting, the information we shared on the cost saving of $1.15 billion (RM 5.1 billion) in treatment expenses and $30.88m (RM135,861,660) in screening expenses for 68,617 persons (0.2% of the population) annually.

Cancer screening costs from diagnostic center is priced at $882 (RM3,880) as compared to mRNA screening at $432 (RM1,900), quantity genechip purchase would drastically reduce the screening cost. The proposed screening campaign is targeting 0.2% of the 34,308,525-population aged 40 years from 2023. A saving of  $30.88m {68,617 persons x ($882-$432)}, a saving of $34,308,525. 



16


We believe that an increase in our marketing and promotional efforts will correlate to increased revenues and the expansion of our business. Our growth and expansion strategies are as follows: 


· | Continue to leverage our relationships with healthcare providers. To date, we have relied upon the efforts of management and their relationships with healthcare providers to create continued interest in our blood-based genomic screening. These relationships have been located primarily in the Klang Valley market. We will continue to use our relationships with providers in the Klang Valley market and elsewhere in Malaysia to increase sales and product awareness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allocate more capital resources to our marketing efforts. Apart from sales through existing relationships with healthcare providers, we intend to allocate more capital to marketing and promotion. As part of these efforts, we have appointed two commission-based Marketing Companies, Gloco and Yakin Healthcare, to bring awareness of our services in Malaysia.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increase focus on corporate clients. To date, we have entered arrangements with six corporate clients to provide our 11 diseases/disorders screening services to their employees. In addition, we intend to solicit more corporate clients in the Klang Valley and major cities in Malaysia. We commenced these efforts last year and will continue in 2023. Our officers and the Marketing Companies will undertake these efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Expand to other regions in Malaysia. We intend to expand to other large cities in Malaysia, such as Penang, Ipoh, Seremban, Melaka, Johor Bahru, and Kuantan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition

We believe that we have the only commercial molecular lab in Malaysia that provides liquid biopsy screenings that detect the risk of cancer, inflammatory diseases, and osteoarthritis risk via RNA biomarkers and provides a report which patients and physicians can use to plan for future tests and personalized therapies. Based on prior private conversations with the USA Thermo Fisher representative in Malaysia, there is a medical lab using similar equipment on DNA screening.
Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have several competitive strengths compared to these other health diagnostic tools. They are as follows:


· | Our screening (a simple blood draw) is less invasive, unlike tissue biopsies. A tissue biopsy is a procedure in which a physician removes a piece of tissue or a sample of cells from a patient's body to be analyzed in a laboratory. If a patient experiences certain signs and symptoms or the physician has identified an area of concern, he may undergo a biopsy to determine whether the patient has cancer or another ailment. While biopsies can have higher accuracy, it is a more invasive procedure that is difficult to repeat and thus impractical for periodic monitoring. BGL's screening tests are a form of liquid biopsy which utilizes RNA biomarkers. Broadly speaking, a liquid biopsy is the collection of a body fluid sample to test for relevant biomarkers to inform patient management, most applied to the collection of peripheral blood for analysis of cell-free circulating tumor ribonucleic acids (RNA). Since liquid biopsies are performed on peripheral blood, which is easy to access, it allows for more widespread use, particularly in patients who cannot have surgery. As a result, liquid biopsies can reduce the time to treatment, improve the efficiency of medical staff and resources, and be used to screen more diseases.

· | Non-DNA blood tests for diseases like cancer are not dispositive. There currently exist various examinations to detect diseases in patients. For example, abnormally high or low levels of certain substances in your body can be a sign of disease. Testing of blood, urine or other body fluids that measure these substances can help doctors make a diagnosis. However, abnormal lab results are not a sure sign of disease. Conventional blood tests are an important tool but are not always reliable because of low sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value.

· | Other Conventional tests could require a longer turnaround time. Imaging is a procedure in which physicians utilize pictures of areas inside the body that help the doctor see whether a disease is present. These images can be taken in several ways, including a CT scan, Nuclear Scan, MRI, PET Scan, and Ultrasound. Imaging is useful in providing physicians with real-time images to assist with diagnosis. However, imaging techniques can have longer turnaround times, the information provided can be limited, and the patient may be exposed to radiation. 
· | Our screening provides a predictive risk assessment for developing the 11 diseases. Most other screening procedures detect diseases only when they are already present in the body and most cases, in the final stages of the disease, making it difficult to treat or reverse. Our screening can detect the 11 diseases at an earlier stage before any symptoms even appear. Early detection and targeted medical intervention could be crucial in saving patients' lives and financial resources. 
· | Our screening measures the current risk of a specific individual rather than their lifetime risk. DNA tests measure a specific individual's lifetime risk based on their DNA. However, since DNA does not change with external factors, it cannot quantify an individual's specific risk of the disease materializing. However, our RNA-based test is highly specific since RNA expression changes with lifestyle and other external factors. Hence, at-risk patients can make timely adjustments to their lifestyles to reduce the potentiality of these diseases. Lifestyle adjustments may include reduction or changes to food, tobacco, and alcohol intake, change of working environment, and the implementation of exercise programs, among other changes.
