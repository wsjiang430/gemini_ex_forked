The Company has other locations in Gainesville, Florida; Austin, Texas; Zaragoza, Spain; Shenzhen, China; Chennai, India; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
 
We have been a global market leader enabling conferencing, collaboration, and network streaming solutions. We design, develop and sell conferencing, collaboration and network streaming solutions for voice and visual communications. The performance and simplicity of our advanced comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability and scalability.
 
Our comprehensive line of high-quality conferencing and collaboration products are targeted for large, medium and small businesses, as well as for personal use. We have been a global market leader in the installed professional audio conferencing market, where our products are used in numerous industries such as enterprise, healthcare, education, government, legal and finance.
 
We have an established history of product innovation and plan to continue to apply our expertise in audio, video and networked AV to design, develop and introduce innovative new products and enhance our existing products. Our end-users range from some of the world’s largest and most prestigious companies and institutions to small and medium-sized businesses, higher education and government organizations, as well as individual consumers. We sell our commercial products to these end-users through a global network of independent distributors who, in turn, sell our products to dealers, systems integrators and other value-added resellers. We also sell directly to dealers, systems integrators and other value-added resellers. Our solutions save end-users time and money by creating a natural environment for collaboration and communication. Our partners, who are involved in system integration are benefitted with simpler project design and support costs with our products designed and built to work with each other seamlessly.
 
On December 4, 2018, we closed a subscription rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) in which we raised $10.0 million in gross proceeds. In the Rights Offering, we issued one subscription right to each of our shareholders for each share of our common stock that they held. Each subscription right entitled the shareholder to purchase one share of our common stock at a purchase price of $1.20 per share. At the closing, we sold 8,306,535 shares of our common stock and returned subscriptions for 754,868 shares that were oversubscribed after allocating oversubscribed shares on a pro-rata basis.

The Ceiling Microphone Array is easily installed and combines affordability with exceptional audio quality. With three wide-range microphones mounted together into a single unit array, the Ceiling Microphone Array provides the rich sound of three individual unidirectional microphones while maintaining full 360-degree coverage. 
 
This product line was further strengthened in 2018 by the introduction of the Ceiling Microphone Array Analog-X and Ceiling Microphone Array Dante series of ceiling microphones. These products feature superior sound quality, adjustability for desired height from 0 to 7 feet and numbered microphone elements for easy identification
 
Wireless Microphones
 
In 2013, ClearOne introduced WS800 Wireless Microphone Systems, including four new models of wireless microphones/transmitters (Tabletop/boundary, Gooseneck, Handheld, Bodypack) and a base-station receiver with either 4 or 8 channels, which connect to professional audio mixers. Since the Sabine acquisition in 2014, our portfolio of wireless microphone systems was enhanced by the introduction of digital compressed versions, Dante standard compatible versions and more frequency ranges catering to various international markets.
 
During 2017, we started shipping DIALOG® 20, the two-channel wireless microphone system. Leveraging the full power of ClearOne's robust, adaptive frequency-hopping "spread" spectrum technology within the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum, DIALOG 20 has several advantages over fixed-frequency transmission. DIALOG 20 incorporates flexible features and multiple options usually available only in much larger systems. While DIALOG 20 works seamlessly with all commercially available mixers, it boasts additional features when natively interfacing with our new CONVERGE Pro 2 or new Beamforming Microphone Array 2.

AV Networking
 
Our AV networking products are primarily sold under VIEW® and VIEW Pro brands and deliver the ultimate IP A/V experience by streaming time sensitive high definition audio and video and control over TCP/IP networks. By combining audio and/or video content, meta-data and control signals into one digital stream in harmony with industry standards, its distributed, edge of the network architecture allows the hardware and the processing power to be distributed across any existing TCP/IP network. This leverages many of the advantages of using TCP/IP over traditional analog systems and other centrally controlled IP-based systems. The ClearOne VIEW and VIEW Pro products are powered by ClearOne’s patented StreamNet® technology. A user can activate and control a single audio source or combination of audio sources, video sources, security systems, HVAC systems, lighting, and other room or facility monitoring functions such as paging or security access by just a single touch to its attractive touch screens. Alternatively, any PC, laptop, tablet, iPod, or other device with a built-in web browser with Flash can control the equipment connected to the system. The VIEW and VIEW Pro systems have no limits on the numbers of sources, displays, or amplifiers in a project and can be used in venues from high-end residential homes to large-scale commercial projects. The number of devices could be determined by the network bandwidth availability, number of media streams and its bandwidth requirements.
 
Converting an audio or video signal to TCP/IP preserves the digital quality of the signal across the network. Unlike analog systems, which lose quality over long distances, TCP/IP packets are decoded to retain the same digital quality as when they were encoded. The addition of Digital Encoder and Digital Decoder products with DVI/HDMI input and output enhances the flexibility of complete AV distribution system and makes it as easy to use as analog devices.
 
VIEW Pro solution provides 1080p60, H.264 high definition HDMI video-audio, 4:4:4 true-color, 24 bit per pixel video output. It comes with dual inputs encoder, single input encoder and single output decoder with balanced audio, general purpose control ports and clock synchronized video output. VIEW Pro system also provides PANORAMATM , a multi-view video composition and video-wall software application using its built-in video processing engine, without using external expensive hardware video processors. This continues to be truly differentiated in the professional market by offering complete AV streaming and distribution systems that can scale to fulfill projects of any size and complexity, from light commercial to the very largest environments. VIEW Pro products include E110 and E120 encoders and D110, D210 and D310 decoders. VIEW Pro solution also comes with multiple license options including audio mixing, video composition, video wall, multicast RTSP and local playback.
 
VIEW CONSOLE software gives integrators a comprehensive platform from which to configure, manage, monitor, and control VIEW system installation using an easy, modern interface. The new toolset, which spotlights the latest in advanced software development technologies, works across ClearOne’s full line of VIEW/VIEW Pro products. In 2017, we released an updated version of VIEW CONSOLE and PANORAMA software applications.
 
During 2018, the VIEW line of products was strengthened by the introduction of VIEW Lite. The VIEW Lite series which includes an encoder, a decoder and a controller, provide essential functionality that meets the full needs of simple AV over IP applications while simultaneously delivering superb price-to-performance value.
 
MARKETING AND SALES
 
We use a two-tier channel model through which we sell our commercial products to a worldwide network of independent professional audiovisual, information technology and telecommunications distributors, who then sell our products to independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, who in turn work directly with the end-users of our products for product fulfillment and installation, if needed. Our products are also specified and recommended by professional audio-visual consultants. We also sell our commercial products directly to certain dealers, systems integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
 
Our product sales generated in the United States and outside the United States for the years ended December 31 are as follows:
 

Revenue in millions | 2018 | | 2017
----------------------+---------+------+-----
 | Revenue | | % | | Revenue | | % 
In the United States | $ | 14.8 | | 53 | % | $ | 24.6 | 59 | %
Outside United States | | 13.4 | | 47 | % | | 17.2 | 41 | %
 | $ | 28.2 | | 100 | % | $ | 41.8 | 100 | %

 
We sell directly to our distributors and resellers in approximately 62 countries worldwide. We anticipate that the portion of our total product revenue from international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue as we further enhance our focus on developing new products, establishing new channel partners, strengthening our presence in key growth areas, complying with regional environmental regulatory standards, and improving product localization with country-specific product documentation and marketing materials.
 
Distributors, Resellers and Independent Integrators
 
We sold our products directly to approximately 360 distributors and direct resellers throughout the world during 2018. Distributors and resellers purchase our products at a discount from list price and resell them worldwide to hundreds of independent systems integrators, telephony value-added resellers, IT value-added resellers, and PC dealers on a non-exclusive basis. Our distributors maintain their own inventory and accounts receivable and are required to provide technical and non-technical support for our products to the next level of distribution participants. We work with our distributors and resellers to establish appropriate inventory stocking levels. We also work with our distributors and resellers to maintain relationships with our existing systems integrators, dealers, and other value-added resellers.
 
While dealers, resellers, and system integrators all sell our products directly to the end-users, system integrators typically add significant value to each sale by combining our products with products from other manufacturers as part of an integrated system solution. Commercial dealers and value-added resellers usually purchase our products from distributors and may bundle our products with products from other manufacturers for resale to the end-user. We maintain close working relationships with all our reseller partners and offer them education and training on all of our products.
 
Marketing
 
Much of our marketing effort is conducted in conjunction with our channel partners who provide leverage for us in reaching existing and prospective customers worldwide. We also regularly attend industry forums and exhibit our products at multiple regional and international trade shows, often with our channel partners. These trade shows provide exposure for our brand and products to a wide audience. We market our ClearOne-branded commercial products on our website www.clearone.com. We also conduct public relations initiatives to get press coverage and product reviews in industry and non-industry publications alike.
Customers
 
Since we sell through distributors and value-added resellers, we do not have comprehensive information on end-users who ultimately use our products. As a result, we do not know whether any end-user accounted for more than 10 percent of our total revenue during any of the periods reported in this Annual Report. Our customers are distributors and value-added resellers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2017 sales to Starin Marketing represented approximately 16% of consolidated revenue with no other customer accounting for more that 10 percent. Starin Marketing ceased to be a ClearOne distributor in 2018.
 
As discussed above, distributors facilitate product sales to a large number of independent systems integrators, dealers, and value-added resellers, and subsequently to their end-users. The loss of one or more distributors could reduce revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our orders fulfilled on which we had not recognized revenue were $0.3 million and $4.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We had a backlog of unfulfilled orders of approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Competition
 
The audio-visual product markets are characterized by intense competition, rapidly evolving technology, and increased business consolidation. We compete with businesses having substantially greater financial, research and product development, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources. If we are not able to continually design, manufacture, and successfully market new or enhanced products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by our competitors and at comparable or better prices, we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales, gross profit margins, profits, and market share, each of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Our competitors vary within each product category. We believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and therefore successfully compete as a result of the high audio quality of our products resulting from a combination of proprietary and highly advanced audio signal processing technologies and networking technology in the form of trade secrets and patented intellectual property, technical and channel support services, and the strength of our channels and brands. It is critical for our success to be able to defend our intellectual property including trademarks, trade secrets and patents from our competitors who have far more resources.
 
We believe the following principal factors drive our sales:
 

● | Quality, features and functionality, and ease of use of the products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broad and deep global channel partnerships. 
● | Brand name recognition and acceptance. 
● | Effective sales and marketing. 
● | Quality of sales and technical support services. 
● | Significant established history of successful worldwide installations for diverse vertical markets.

 
In the professional audio conferencing system and sound reinforcement markets our main competitors include AcousticMagic, AMX Biamp, BOSE, Crestron, Extron, Harman International/BSS, Peavey, Phoenix Audio, Polycom, QSC, Shure, Symetrix, Vaddio and Yamaha and their original equipment manufacturing (OEM) partners, along with several other companies potentially poised to enter the market.

Regulatory Environment
 
Regulations regarding product safety, product operational agency compliance, the materials used in manufacturing, the process of disposing of electronic equipment and the efficient use of energy may require extensive lead-time to obtain regulatory approvals of new products in both domestic and international markets. Such regulations may impact our ability to expand our sales in a timely and cost-effective manner and, as a result, our business could be harmed.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We manufacture our products through electronics manufacturing services (“EMS”) providers, who are generally responsible for sourcing and procuring required raw materials and components. Most of the components that our EMS providers require for manufacturing our products are readily available from a number of sources. During 2017, we witnessed a significant tightening of the electronics market with demand for electronic products especially for memories and processors far exceeding the supply caused price increases and longer fulfillment cycles. During 2018 the fulfillment cycles improved.
 
We continually work with our EMS providers to seek alternative sources for all our components and raw material requirements to ensure higher quality and better pricing. Most of our EMS providers and their vendors are duly qualified by our corporate quality assurance process. We work with our EMS providers to ensure that raw materials and components conform to our specifications.
 
Manufacturing
 
Currently, all of our products are manufactured by EMS providers. Our primary EMS provider is Flextronics.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not recognize a consistent pattern between the quarters to identify seasonality.
 
Research and Product Development
 
We are committed to research and product development and view our continued investment in research and product development as a key ingredient to our long-term business success. Our research and product development expenditures were approximately $7.8 million and $9.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 
Our core competencies in research and product development include (a) many audio technologies, including acoustic echo cancellation, noise cancellation and other advanced adaptive digital signal processing technologies, (b) networking and multimedia streaming technologies, (c) video technologies, and (d) cloud technologies. We also have expertise in wireless technologies, VoIP, software and network system development. We believe that continued investment in our core technological competencies is vital to developing new products and to enhancing existing products.
 
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and processes to protect our proprietary rights.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 90 patents and 13 pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. Our patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of our products and services including, but not limited to acoustic echo cancellation, beamforming microphone arrays, systems that enable streaming media over IP networks, algorithms for video processing, wireless conferencing systems, spatial audio, and technologies for the Internet of Things. The durations of our patents are determined by the laws of the country of issuance. For the U.S., patents may be 17 years from the date of issuance of the patent or 20 years from the date of its filing, depending upon when the patent application was filed. In addition, we hold numerous U.S. trademarks. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as the laws of the United States.

ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
 
We will obtain patents and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Our intellectual property policy is to protect our products, technology and processes by asserting our intellectual property rights where appropriate and prudent. From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us. In addition, certain pending claims against a competitor are in various stages of litigation. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8) for information regarding current legal proceedings involving our intellectual property rights.
 
We are dependent on our intellectual property. If we are not able to protect our proprietary rights or if those rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business may be adversely affected. We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business.”
 
We generally require our employees, certain customers and partners to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements before we disclose any confidential aspect of our technology, services, or business. In addition, our employees are required to assign to us any proprietary information, inventions, or other technology created during the term of their employment with us. However, these precautions may not be sufficient to protect us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
 
The Company is involved in patent infringement lawsuits against Shure Inc. ("Shure").
 
On April 24, 2017, Shure initiated litigation against the Company in the matter styled Shure Inc. v. ClearOne, Inc., 1:17-cv-03078, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, before the Honorable Edmond E. Chang. Shure’s initial complaint sought a declaratory judgment for non-infringement and invalidity of the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 9,635,186 ("’186 Patent") and Patent No. 9,264,553 ("’553 Patent"). In early 2018, Shure added a claim that the ‘186 Patent is unenforceable. The Court dismissed Shure’s request for declaratory judgment relating to the ’553 Patent, which at the time in 2017, had not been asserted by the Company against any defendant and had been submitted to the USPTO for reissue. The Company has filed counterclaims against Shure for willful infringement of the Company’s ’186 Patent and the Company’s U.S. Patent No. 9,813,806 ("’806 Patent").
 
On April 10, 2019, the Company filed a new lawsuit against Shure in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, styled ClearOne, Inc. v. Shure Inc., 1:19-cv-02421.  In this lawsuit, the Company asserts claims against Shure for infringement of the Company’s ’553 Patent and for trade secret misappropriation.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 130 full-time employees. Of these employees, 88 were located in the U.S. and 42 in locations outside the U.S. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. We also hire contractors with specific skill sets to meet our operational needs.
