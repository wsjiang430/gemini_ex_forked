Item 1. Business
Background
 
The Company has only recently emerged from its status as a development-stage company, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report stating there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Summary
 
The Company operated a deep discount variety retail store under the name “Dollar Green Stores” (“dollar stores”) in Sacramento. The store was closed in September 2018.
 
In September 2013, the Company’s management developed plans to open and operate two retail stores in Sacramento, California, under the named “Dollar Green Stores.” In February 2014, the Company opened its first dollar store in Sacramento, which consists of more than 2,200 square feet of retail store space. The Company opened its second dollar store in May 2014. In August 2014, the Company was forced to close its original store due to its landlord’s failure to comply with city building codes. The Company relocated the second store in December 2015 and settled the existing lease at that time. The Company currently operates no variety retail stores.
 
Additionally, the Company began limited trading of precious metals in December 2014 with the purchase 100 ounces of silver. The Company has since purchased gold and is evaluating potentially expanding its ownership of additional precious metals. Though management has limited experience in the precious metals field they have solicited outside experts contribute to the Company’s investment strategies.
 
The Company also has plans to acquire and operate hotels and residential properties in the high demand areas of California such as Southern California and the Bay Area.
 
On April 18, 2017 the Company entered into a Letter of Intent to purchase a central California hotel for approximately $7,000,000 and entering escrow October 2017 however with the escrow expired in December 2017 and the purchase did not close.
 
On October 22, 2018, Sunstock, Inc. acquired all assets and liabilities of Mom’s Silver Shop, Inc. of Sacramento, California. Included in the assets acquired was approximately $60,000 in precious metals inventory and approximately $13,000 in net fixtures. Also included were any licenses and permits, customer lists, logo, trade names, signs, and websites. Financing of the purchase was by $20,056 cash, $33,000 unsecured note payable with principle payments of $1,000 per week for 33 weeks starting January 1, 2019 with 4.5% annual interest accrued on the unpaid balance (total accrued interest due August 27, 2019), and the assumption of liabilities and lease obligations. Mom’s Silver Shop had unaudited net revenues of approximately $4,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, $4,000,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, $3,800,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $2,500,000 in 2018 to the date of acquisition.

The Business: Hotel and Residential Properties
 
The Company believes the hotel industry accounts for a significant part of the overall economy. The industry is highly segmented with many different brands targeting a vast range of customer needs at various price points. Businesses in the hotel industry generally operate under one or more business models, including hotel management, brand franchising and hotel ownership. Hotels are categorized into three groups: full-service, select-service and limited-service. Full-service hotels typically offer a full range of amenities and facilities, including food and beverage facilities and meeting facilities. Select-service hotels furnish some of the amenities offered at full-service hotels but on a smaller scale and generally do not to have meeting facilities. Limited-service hotels usually offer only lodging, however some provide modest food and beverage facilities such as breakfast buffets or small meeting rooms.
 
Lodging demand growth is generally related to the strength of the overall economy. Additionally, local demand factors may stimulate business and leisure travel to specific locations. In particular, macroeconomic trends relating to GDP growth, corporate profits, capital investments and employment growth are some of the primary drivers of lodging demand. As the economy continues to improve, the ongoing trend of strong transient demand and growing group business will continue to drive demand for hotels and lodging and allow the industry to achieve increased growth.

The Business: Precious Metals
 
Silver and other precious metals, may be used as an investment. A traditional way of investing in silver is by buying actual bullion bars. In some countries, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, bullion bars can be bought or sold over the counter at major banks. Another means of buying and trading silver is through silver coins. Silver coins include the one ounce 99.99% pure Canadian Silver Maple Leaf and the one ounce 99.93% pure American Silver Eagle. Likewise, an increasing popular method of trading in silver and precious metals is through exchange-traded products, such as exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and closed-end funds that aim to track the price of silver. Silver exchange-traded products are traded on the major stock exchanges including the London and New York Stock Exchanges.
 
The Company believes that stimulative monetary policies adopted by the United States, the European Union, China and Japan may cause an increase in inflation. Gold and silver have traditionally served as a hedge against economic uncertainty and high inflation.
 
At the present time, the Company does not anticipate or foresee a material effect on this line of its business from existing or probable governmental regulations.
