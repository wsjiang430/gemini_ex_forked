 Item 1. Business.
Overview
Aterian, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Aterian”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”), is a technology-enabled consumer product company that uses “data science” (which includes but is not limited to, machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics) to design, develop, market and sell products. We predominantly operate through online retail channels such as Amazon.com (“Amazon”) and Walmart, Inc. ("Walmart").
 We own and operate fifteen brands which sell products in multiple categories, including home and kitchen appliances, kitchenware, heating, cooling and air quality appliances (dehumidifiers, humidifiers and air conditioners), health and beauty products and essential oils. Our fifteen brands are hOmeLabs; Vremi, Squatty Potty; Xtava; RIF6; Aussie Health; Holonix; Truweo; Mueller; Pursteam; Pohl and Schmitt; Spiralizer; Healing Solutions; Photo Paper Direct and Step and Go.
 
To allow us to scale, we have invested in building our own proprietary data science based software technology platform, known as AIMEE. AIMEE, our “Artificial Intelligence Marketplace Ecommerce Engine” enables our team to manage our business more efficiently by injecting technology into processes that would otherwise have to be executed manually. AIMEE combines large quantities of data, data science and other automation algorithms, at scale, to allow rapid opportunity identification and automated online sales and marketing of consumer products.
 
AIMEE sources data from various e-commerce platforms, the internet and publicly available data, allowing us to estimate and determine trends, performance and consumer sentiment on products and searches within e-commerce platforms. This functionality, and other data sources, allow us to help determine which products to develop, market and sell on e-commerce marketplaces. In addition, AIMEE is also connected, through application program interfaces (“APIs”), to multiple e-commerce platforms. This allows us to automate the purchase of marketing, automate various parts of our fulfillment and logistics operations and to automate pricing changes on product listings. We generate revenue primarily through the online sales of our various consumer products with substantially all of our sales being made through the Amazon U.S. marketplace.
 See the sections contained within this Annual Report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” for further information.
Our History and Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Mohawk Group Holdings, Inc. in March 2018 and we changed our name to Aterian, Inc. in April 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we have multiple operating subsidiaries and we conduct material aspects of our business in the U.S., the Philippines, Poland and China.
Our principal executive offices are located at 37 East 18th Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10003. Our website address is www.aterian.io. We do not incorporate the information on, or accessible through, our website into this Annual Report, and you should not consider any information on, or accessible through, our website as part of this Annual Report. We have included our website address in this Annual Report solely as an inactive textual reference.
Our Platform

AIMEE, our proprietary technology, is a cloud-based modular platform incorporating a multi-tenant architecture. AIMEE connects to multiple e-commerce platforms and other internet based sources through application program interfaces (“APIs”) in order to ingest data.

At its core, AIMEE ingests data used in product research, analysis and performance and provides the automation of numerous sales, marketing and fulfillment tasks and functions. AIMEE helps us automate and manage the life-cycle of our consumer product portfolio and provides us with the ability to scale our business efficiently. AIMEE, along with our people, allows us to perform the following key business functions:
 1)identify specific product and market opportunities;
 2)execute and manage certain online marketing strategies;
 3)automate portions of the fulfillment processes;
 4)receive inventory visibility; and
 5)receive individual product operational and financial performance.


We continue to develop AIMEE’s capabilities. This includes forecasting, inventory management, online marketing and other aspects, which require human judgment and oversight. At its core, AIMEE is designed to intelligently automate many of our business tasks and provides us with the ability to scale our business.
 Acquisitions
While we pursue growth from our existing product portfolio and from new product launches, we also intend to pursue growth through strategic acquisitions of brands that we believe will integrate well with our business.
 Intellectual Property
We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements (including open source software) to protect our intellectual property. We generally do not pursue patent applications as a means of protecting our intellectual property. We have applied to register or have registered certain of our trademarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective.
Customers
Our customers are mainly individual online consumers who purchase our products primarily on Amazon US, and to a lesser extent on our owned and operated websites and other marketplaces, such as Walmart. In 2021, approximately 93% of our revenue was through the Amazon sales platform and in 2022, 89% of our revenue was through the Amazon sales platform.
 Seasonality
Our individual product categories are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of the summer season for certain of our environmental appliance products and the fall and holiday season for our small kitchen appliances and accessories. With our cooling and air quality products, the sales tend to be significantly higher in the summer season. Further, our small kitchen appliances and accessories tend to have higher sales during the fourth quarter, which includes Thanksgiving and the December holiday season. As a result, our operational results, cash flows, cash and inventory positions may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in our product mix.
 Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing strategy and approach is driven by our people, who substantially leverage AIMEE. AIMEE is being developed to allow price automatization, media buying and search engine optimization leveraging our proprietary technology software and algorithms we have built into AIMEE. We believe this automation will bring significant competitive advantages for our products. For our SKUs, our advertising investment is focused on online channels and e-commerce platforms. Currently our primary focus on advertising spend is online across Amazon, Google and Facebook.
 Third-Party Manufacturing & Logistics

During 2022, we purchased substantially all of our finished products from suppliers in China. We do not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operate mainly on a purchase order basis. We negotiate purchases from our foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars. We purchased our inventory from approximately 77 suppliers, one of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022. While we believe the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on our business due to the availability of other suppliers, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, materially and adversely impact our business.

The principal raw materials used by our third-party suppliers to manufacture our products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. We believe adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
 We use a combination of Amazon warehouses, other third-party warehouse and logistics partners to fulfill direct-to-consumer orders, through agreements or terms of services. In addition to fulfillment by Amazon warehouses, we use geographically distributed third-party warehouses in the U.S. to deliver orders within one to two days through ground shipment to most customers.

Competition
 
The consumer goods and e-commerce markets are highly competitive and dynamic. We compete primarily against numerous third-party brands and sellers on marketplaces for each of our products. Competition is based on price, product features and quality, strong ratings and reviews, effective marketing, visibility and location on the online shelf and supply chain excellence, which is mostly the ability to deliver products to customers in one to two days. In certain instances, we compete directly with our third party suppliers who sell their own brands directly to customers, including with respect to certain of our material products such as dehumidifiers.
Regulatory Matters/Governmental Regulations
We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local laws and international laws, including but not limited to those governing the processing of payments, consumer protection, the privacy of consumer information and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices. We are also subject to various environmental laws, rules and regulations, such as California’s Proposition 65.
 The products sold by us are also subject to regulation by U.S. governmental agencies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, United States Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy and similar state and international regulatory authorities, such as the California Energy Commission. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
 We are also subject to regulations relating to our supply chain. For example, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act requires retail sellers that do business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. As part of our vendor qualification process, we review suppliers’ operations for compliance with applicable labor and workplace standards and other applicable laws, including laws prohibiting child labor, forced labor and unsafe working conditions.
A significant portion of our products are currently manufactured in China, which may result in additional costs, if laws related to international trade result in additional tariffs on our products.
 Although we have not suffered any material restrictions from doing business in the past due to government regulations, significant impediments may arise in the future as we expand product offerings.
 
From time to time, we dispose of or donate obsolete inventory in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
 People

The human capital objectives we focus on in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining key personnel. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive stockholder value. We provide competitive compensation, which includes a focus on stock-based compensation, and benefits to attract and retain key personnel, while also providing a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. As of December 31, 2022, we had 178 full-time employees, and 64 independent contractors. As of December 31, 2022, our employees and contractors are based in offices, shared workspaces and remote work locations in the U.S., China, the U.K., the Philippines, and in Poland. We also contract with 33 consultants, in Ukraine, Serbia, Israel, France, Costa Rica, and Canada.
