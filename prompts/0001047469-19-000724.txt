     ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
  Overview 
         United Therapeutics Corporation focuses on the strength of a balanced, value-creating biotechnology model. We are confident in our future thanks to our fundamental attributes, namely our obsession with quality and innovation, the power of our brands, our entrepreneurial culture and our bioinformatics leadership. We also believe that our determination to be responsible citizenshaving a positive impact on patients, the environment and societywill sustain our success in the long term. 
         Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology PBC, we are focused on addressing the acute national shortage of transplantable lungs and other organs with a variety of technologies that either delay the need for such organs or expand the supply. Lung Biotechnology is the first public benefit corporation subsidiary of a public biotechnology or pharmaceutical company. 
         We market and sell four commercial therapies in the United States to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Remodulin® (treprostinil) Injection (Remodulin); Tyvaso® (treprostinil) Inhalation Solution (Tyvaso); Orenitram® (treprostinil) Extended-Release Tablets (Orenitram); and Adcirca® (tadalafil) Tablets (Adcirca). We also market and sell an oncology product in the United States, Unituxin® (dinutuximab) Injection (Unituxin), which is approved for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Outside the United States, our only significant revenues are derived from the sale of Remodulin, which is approved in Europe and various other countries. We are also engaged in research and development of new indications, formulations and delivery devices for our existing products, as well as new products to treat PAH and other conditions. 
         We generate revenues from sales of our five commercially approved products noted above. Remodulin was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for subcutaneous and intravenous administration in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and has been sold commercially in the United States since 2002. Tyvaso and Adcirca were both approved by the FDA and launched commercially in the United States in 2009. Orenitram and Unituxin were approved by the FDA in 2013 and 2015, respectively, and were launched commercially in the United States in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our sales, marketing and other commercial staff supports the availability of our commercial products in the United States, and these efforts are supplemented by our contract distributors. Outside the United States, our contract distributors are primarily responsible for sales and marketing efforts. 
         United Therapeutics was incorporated in Delaware in June 1996. Our principal executive offices are located at 1040 Spring Street, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 and at 55 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.

  Products to Treat Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
         PAH is a life-threatening disease that affects the blood vessels in the lungs and is characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, which are the blood vessels leading from the heart to the lungs. The elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries strains the right side of the heart as it pumps blood to the lungs. This eventually leads to right heart failure and, ultimately, death. PAH is characterized by structural changes in blood vessel walls, aggregation of platelets and alteration of smooth muscle cell function. We believe that PAH affects about 500,000 individuals worldwide. We have seen increases in the number of people diagnosed with the disease, but due to the rarity of the disease and the complexity of diagnosing it, only a small fraction of patients with PAH are being treated. 
 4

           Current FDA-approved therapies for PAH focus on three distinct molecular pathways: the prostacyclin pathway, the nitric oxide (NO) pathway, and the endothelin (ET) pathway. The classes of drugs that target these three pathways are: 
 

 Prostacyclin Analogues and IP Prostacyclin Receptor Agonists.  Patients with
PAH have been shown to have reduced levels of prostacyclin, a naturally occurring substance that relaxes the pulmonary blood vessels, prevents platelet aggregation and inhibits the proliferation of
smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vessels. Therefore, drugs that mimic the action of prostacyclin, known as prostacyclin analogues, are established PAH treatments. Another class of therapy, called
IP prostacyclin receptor agonists, has recently been developed to address PAH through the prostacyclin pathway. As compared with prostacyclin analogues, which broadly mimic the effect of prostacyclin,
IP prostacyclin receptor agonists bind selectively to the IP receptor, one of several prostacyclin receptors. 
 Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors and Guanylate Cyclase (sGC)
Stimulators.  Patients with PAH have also been shown to have reduced levels of the enzyme responsible for producing NO, a naturally occurring
substance in the body that causes relaxation of the pulmonary blood vessels. NO produces this effect by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate GMP (cyclic GMP). Therefore,
another established therapeutic approach has been to inhibit the degradation of cyclic GMP using drugs known as PDE-5 inhibitors. In addition, sGC is an enzyme found in the endothelial cells and the
receptor for NO. When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme enhances production of cyclic GMP. As a result, sGC stimulators are also approved to treat PAH. 
 Endothelin Receptor Antagonists.  PAH patients have also been shown to have
elevated levels of endothelin-1, a naturally occurring substance in the body that causes constriction of, and structural changes to, the pulmonary blood vessels. Therefore, another established
therapeutic approach has been to block the action of endothelin with drugs that are known as endothelin receptor antagonists (ETRAs). 

         Because any or all of the three pathways may be therapeutic targets in a patient, these classes of drugs are used alone or in combination to treat patients with PAH. We currently market drugs in two of these classes. Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram are all formulations of treprostinil, a prostacyclin analogue, and Adcirca is a PDE-5 inhibitor. 
         The clinical severity of PAH is classified according to a system originally developed for heart failure by the New York Heart Association and then modified by the World Health Organization (WHO) for patients with PAH, ranging from functional class I (no symptoms) through functional class IV (severe symptoms). Labeled indications for PAH therapies often note that clinical studies for the drug predominantly included patients in one or more functional classes. 
         PAH is a subset of the condition more broadly known as pulmonary hypertension. WHO has classified pulmonary hypertension into five groups, with PAH being designated WHO Group 1, which includes multiple etiologies such as idiopathic (meaning the cause is unknown) and heritable PAH, as well as PAH associated with connective tissue diseases. While our PAH therapies' labeling is limited to the treatment of WHO Group 1 PAH, we are engaged in research and development efforts to expand the use of Orenitram to treat pulmonary hypertension in certain categories of WHO Group 2, and Tyvaso to treat pulmonary hypertension in certain categories of WHO Group 3. For further details, see Research and Development below. 
 


Remodulin 

         We sell Remodulin to specialty pharmaceutical distributors in the United States and to pharmaceutical distributors internationally. We recognized $599.0 million, $670.9 million and 
 5

   $602.3 million in Remodulin net product sales, representing 37 percent, 39 percent and 38 percent of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Remodulin is indicated to treat patients with PAH, to diminish symptoms associated with exercise. Studies establishing effectiveness included patients with functional class II-IV (moderate to severe) symptoms. 
         Outside of the United States, Remodulin is approved for the treatment of PAH in 38 countries by continuous subcutaneous administration and in 35 countries by continuous intravenous administration, and is sold commercially in most of these countries. In May 2019, our marketing authorization for Remodulin in China will expire, at which point we expect to withdraw Remodulin from the Chinese market in light of the anticipated availability of a generic version of Remodulin. Revenues from sales of Remodulin in China have been immaterial. 
         We believe Remodulin has many qualities that make it an appealing alternative to competitive therapies. Remodulin is stable at room temperature, so it does not need to be cooled during infusion and patients do not need to use cooling packs or refrigeration to keep it stable. Treprostinil is highly soluble and highly potent, which enables us to manufacture Remodulin in concentrated solutions. This allows therapeutic concentrations of Remodulin to be delivered at very low flow rates via miniaturized infusion pumps for both subcutaneous and intravenous infusion. Remodulin can be continuously infused for up to 48 hours intravenously or 72 hours subcutaneously before refilling the external infusion pump. This profile contrasts favorably with the other continuously infused prostacyclin therapies in the marketFlolan®, Veletri® and generic epoprostenol. 
         Flolan and generic epoprostenol are not stable at room temperature (and therefore require refrigeration or the use of cooling packs), but Veletri may be stable at room temperature depending on its concentration. Flolan, generic epoprostenol, and Veletri have shorter half-lives than Remodulin, requiring mixing prior to pump refills. None of these competitive products may be administered via subcutaneous infusion, and therefore may only be delivered intravenously. 
         We settled litigation with each of Sandoz, Inc. (Sandoz), Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva), Par Sterile Products, LLC (Par) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. (Dr. Reddy's), related to their abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Remodulin before the expiration of certain of our U.S. patents. Under the terms of our settlement agreements, Sandoz was permitted to market its generic version of Remodulin in the United States beginning in June 2018, and Teva, Par and Dr. Reddy's were each permitted to launch their generic versions in the United States beginning in December 2018. To our knowledge, none of these companies has yet launched sales of a generic version of Remodulin. For further detail, see the section below entitled Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market ExclusivityGeneric Competition. 
         Patients must use external pumps manufactured by third parties to deliver Remodulin. Smiths Medical manufactures the pumps used by most patients in the United States to administer Remodulin, including the Smiths CADD® MS-3 pump used to deliver subcutaneous Remodulin. In 2015, Smiths Medical notified us that it was planning to discontinue the manufacture of the CADD MS-3 pumps and associated cartridges. We entered into an agreement with Smiths Medical to fund the manufacture of a further supply of CADD MS-3 pumps and cartridges for use with branded Remodulin only. We anticipate this supply will be sufficient to ensure continued support of subcutaneous Remodulin for several years, and are working with Smiths Medical to develop a next-generation infusion system called RemoLife prior to the exhaustion of the available CADD MS-3 supply. As noted below under Research and Development, we are also working on developing the Trevyent and RemUnity systems for subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin. 
         There are serious adverse events associated with Remodulin. For example, when infused subcutaneously, Remodulin causes varying degrees of infusion site pain and reaction (redness and swelling) in most patients. Patients who cannot tolerate the infusion site pain related to the use of 
 6

   subcutaneous Remodulin may instead use intravenous Remodulin. Intravenous Remodulin is delivered continuously through a surgically implanted central venous catheter, similar to Flolan, Veletri and generic epoprostenol. Patients who receive therapy through implanted venous catheters have a risk of developing blood stream infections and a serious systemic infection known as sepsis. As a result, subcutaneous administration is the preferred method of Remodulin delivery, and is used by a majority of U.S. Remodulin patients. Other common side effects associated with both subcutaneous and intravenous Remodulin include headache, diarrhea, nausea, jaw pain, vasodilation and edema. 
 


Tyvaso 

         We sell Tyvaso to the same specialty pharmaceutical distributors in the United States that distribute Remodulin. We recognized $415.2 million, $372.9 million and $404.6 million in Tyvaso net product sales, representing 25 percent, 22 percent and 25 percent of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tyvaso is approved in the United States, Israel and Argentina. 
         Tyvaso is administered four times a day by inhaling up to nine breaths during each treatment session, which takes approximately three minutes. Tyvaso is required to be administered using our proprietary Tyvaso Inhalation System, which consists of an ultra-sonic nebulizer and related accessories. A single ampule containing Tyvaso is emptied into the Tyvaso Inhalation System once per day, so the Tyvaso Inhalation System only needs to be cleaned once daily. Tyvaso is regulated by the FDA as a drug-device combination product, consisting of Tyvaso drug product and the Tyvaso Inhalation System. 
         Ventavis® (iloprost) is the only other FDA-approved inhaled prostacyclin analogue. Patients need to inhale Ventavis six to nine times per day via a nebulizer. According to its package insert, each Ventavis inhalation consists of four to ten minutes of continuous inhalation via the nebulizer. We completed an open-label study in the United States to investigate the clinical effects of switching patients from Ventavis to Tyvaso. Patients in this study saved an average of approximately 1.4 hours per day when administering Tyvaso compared to Ventavis. 
         Studies establishing the effectiveness of Tyvaso included predominately patients with functional class III symptoms (may not have symptoms at rest but activities are greatly limited by shortness of breath, fatigue, or near fainting). Tyvaso was generally well tolerated in our trials. The most common adverse events were transient cough, headache, nausea, dizziness and flushing. 
         In August 2018, we settled patent litigation with Watson Laboratories, Inc. (Watson) related to its ANDA seeking to market a generic version of Tyvaso in the United States. Under the terms of this settlement, Watson may launch its generic version of Tyvaso in the United States beginning in January 2026, although Watson may be permitted to enter the market earlier under certain circumstances. For further detail, see the section below entitled Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market ExclusivityGeneric Competition. 
 


Orenitram 

         Orenitram is the only FDA approved, orally administered prostacyclin analogue, and is the only oral PAH prostacyclin class therapy approved in the United States that is titratable to a maximum tolerated dose, without a dose ceiling. We sell Orenitram to the same specialty pharmaceutical distributors in the United States that distribute Remodulin and Tyvaso. We recognized $205.1 million, $185.8 million and $157.2 million in Orenitram net product sales, representing 13 percent, 11 percent and 10 percent of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The primary study that established efficacy included predominately patients with functional class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (75 percent) or PAH associated with connective tissue disease (19 percent). The most common side effects observed in our clinical studies were headache, nausea and diarrhea. Orenitram is not approved outside the United States. 
 7

           In February 2018, we settled patent litigation with Actavis Laboratories FL, Inc. (Actavis) related to its ANDA seeking to market a generic version of Orenitram in the United States. Under the terms of this settlement, Actavis may launch its generic version of Orenitram in the United States beginning in June 2027, although Actavis may be permitted to enter the market earlier under certain circumstances. For further detail, see the section below entitled Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market ExclusivityGeneric Competition. 
 


Adcirca 

         Adcirca is a PDE-5 inhibitor, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of which is tadalafil. Tadalafil is also the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis®, which is marketed by Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. We acquired the commercial rights to Adcirca for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Lilly in 2008. We sell Adcirca at prices established by Lilly, which are at parity with Cialis pricing. We recognized $323.7 million, $419.7 million and $372.2 million in Adcirca net product sales, representing 20 percent, 24 percent and 23 percent of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
         In 2009, the FDA approved Adcirca with a recommended dose of 40 mg, making it the only once-daily PDE-5 inhibitor for the treatment of PAH. Adcirca is indicated to improve exercise ability in patients with PAH. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominately patients with functional class II-III symptoms. Headaches were the most commonly reported side effect. 
         Prior to the approval of Adcirca, Revatio®, which is marketed by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), was the only PDE-5 inhibitor approved for the treatment of PAH. Sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient in Revatio, is also the active ingredient in Viagra®, which is marketed by Pfizer for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In 2012, several companies launched generic formulations of sildenafil citrate. Revatio and generic sildenafil citrate are dosed three times daily. 
         In September 2014, Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) announced the results of a study of ambrisentan (an ETRA) and tadalafil in PAH patients as a first-line combination treatment, compared to treating PAH patients with only ambrisentan or tadalafil. In the study, first-line treatment with both therapies reduced the risk of clinical failure (a composite endpoint that incorporates clinical worsening eventsdeath, hospitalization and disease worseningand a component of unsatisfactory long-term clinical response) compared to a monotherapy treatment by 50 percent. Based on these results, in October 2015, the FDA approved an update to the new drug application (NDA) for Letairis® (ambrisentan), permitting the use of Letairis in combination with tadalafil for PAH to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. 
         In May 2017, we amended our Adcirca license agreement with Lilly to clarify and extend the term of the agreement and to amend the economic terms of the agreement following the expiration of a patent covering Adcirca in November 2017. As a result of this amendment, beginning December 1, 2017, our royalty rate on net product sales of Adcirca increased from five percent to ten percent, and we are required to make milestone payments to Lilly equal to $325,000 for each $1,000,000 in net product sales. Adcirca's cost of product sales as a percentage of Adcirca's net product sales has increased significantly since December 1, 2017 due to these cost increases. In August 2018, Mylan N.V. announced the launch of its generic version of Adcirca, which resulted in a material adverse impact on Adcirca net product sales. Additional companies launched generic versions of Adcirca in February 2019. For further detail, see the section below entitled  Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market ExclusivityGeneric Competition. 
         Our license agreement with Lilly related to Adcirca expires on December 31, 2020.

  Product to Treat CancerUnituxin 
         In March 2015, the FDA approved our Biologics License Application (BLA) for Unituxin, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), for the treatment of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (a rare form of pediatric cancer) who achieve at least a partial response to prior first-line multiagent, multimodality therapy. Unituxin is a chimeric, composed of a combination of mouse and human DNA, monoclonal antibody that induces antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, a mechanism of cell-mediated immunity whereby the immune system actively targets a cell that has been bound by specific antibodies. Unituxin therapy is associated with severe side effects, including infections, infusion reactions, hypokalemia, hypotension, pain, fever, and capillary leak syndrome. In November 2018, we received approval from Health Canada to market Unituxin, and we are preparing to launch commercial sales of the product in Canada during the second quarter of 2019. 
         We recognized $84.8 million, $76.0 million and $62.5 million in Unituxin net product sales, representing five percent, four percent and four percent of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
   Research and Development 
         We focus most of our research and development efforts on the following near-term pipeline programs (intended to result in product launches in the 2019-2021 timeframe) and medium-term pipeline programs (intended to result in product launches in the 2022-2025 timeframe). We are also engaged in a variety of additional medium- and long-term research and development efforts, including technologies designed to increase the supply of transplantable organs and tissues and improve outcomes for transplant recipients through regenerative medicine, xenotransplantation, biomechanical lungs and ex-vivo lung perfusion.

  Implantable System for Remodulin 
         On July 30, 2018, we obtained FDA approval of the Implantable System for Remodulin in the United States. We developed this system in collaboration with Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic). The system incorporates a proprietary Medtronic intravascular infusion catheter with Medtronic's SynchroMed® II implantable infusion pump and related infusion system components (together referred to as the Implantable System for Remodulin) in order to deliver Remodulin for the treatment of PAH. We believe this technology has the potential to reduce many of the patient burdens and other complications associated with the use of external pumps to administer prostacyclin analogues. The FDA approved Medtronic's premarket approval application (PMA) for the device in December 2017, and our NDA for the use of Remodulin in the implantable pump in July 2018. Medtronic must satisfy certain conditions to its PMA approval before we can launch the Implantable System for Remodulin. We have no control over when or whether these conditions will be met. 
 11

           In February 2019, we entered into a commercialization agreement under which Medtronic will manufacture and supply the Implantable System for Remodulin, and we will manufacture and supply Remodulin for use in the system. Each party will perform certain additional activities to support the commercialization of the Implantable System for Remodulin, and we will reimburse Medtronic's costs to provide such support. We will pay Medtronic a royalty equal to ten percent of our net sales of Remodulin administered via the Implantable System for Remodulin. We have entered into an agreement with Caremark, L.L.C. (CVS Specialty) to provide for refills of implanted pumps at its infusion centers. Once Medtronic satisfies its remaining PMA conditions, we plan to approach the launch in a careful and deliberate manner to ensure the safety of patients and the long-term success of the program. Medtronic has agreed to produce a supply of pumps for the initial launch that we believe will be sufficient to provide the system to any eligible PAH patient in the United States currently receiving intravenous prostacyclin therapy. We anticipate that the initial pump supply will enable us to launch the Implantable System for Remodulin in 2019 at the ten clinical trial sites that participated in the pivotal DelIVery clinical study of the Implantable System for Remodulin, and subsequently commence a broader launch in up to approximately 100 additional sites by the end of the year. These timelines are subject to a number of factors outside our control, including Medtronic's satisfaction of its PMA conditions. We are also working with Medtronic to develop a next-generation system incorporating various enhancements. 
         Medtronic is entirely responsible for regulatory approvals and all manufacturing and quality systems related to its infusion pump and related components. Medtronic entered into a consent decree with the FDA in April 2015, which required Medtronic to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed II pump and the associated quality system. The consent decree restricted Medtronic's ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed II infusion system, unless specific conditions were met, including retention of a third-party expert to inspect the affected quality system and certify that the quality system complies with the requirements of the consent decree. Medtronic completed the third-party certification audits in January 2017 and successfully completed an FDA inspection in June 2017. After the inspection, FDA lifted the consent decree restrictions on manufacturing, distribution, and design in September 2017. The consent decree remains in effect, with ongoing obligations for annual third-party audits continuing until September 2020. Non-compliance by Medtronic with its consent decree could interrupt the manufacture and sale of the Implantable System for Remodulin. 
 


RemUnity and RemoPro 

         In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with DEKA Research & Development Corp. (DEKA) to develop a pre-filled, semi-disposable system for subcutaneous delivery of treprostinil, which we call the RemUnity system. Under the terms of the agreement, we are funding the development costs related to the RemUnity system and will pay product fees and a single-digit royalty to DEKA based on commercial sales of the system and the treprostinil drug product sold for use with the system. The RemUnity system consists of a small, lightweight, durable pump that is intended to have a service life of at least three years. The RemUnity system uses disposable cartridges pre-filled with treprostinil, which can be connected to the pump with less patient manipulation than is typically involved in filling currently-available subcutaneous pumps. 
         DEKA is working with the FDA to obtain 510(k) clearance of the RemUnity system. Initially, we plan to launch the system with disposable components to be pre-filled with Remodulin by our specialty pharmacy distributors. We are also developing a version of the system that includes disposable components that are pre-filled as part of the manufacturing process. 
         We are also conducting phase I studies to develop a new prodrug of treprostinil called RemoPro, which is intended to enable subcutaneous delivery without the site pain currently associated with subcutaneous Remodulin. As a prodrug, RemoPro is designed to be inactive in the subcutaneous tissue, 
 12

   which should decrease or eliminate site pain, and to metabolize into treprostinil once it is absorbed into the blood. 
 


Trevyent 

         In August 2018, we acquired SteadyMed Ltd. (SteadyMed), which is developing Trevyent, a post-phase III development-stage drug-device combination product that combines SteadyMed's two-day, single use, disposable PatchPump technology with treprostinil, for the subcutaneous treatment of PAH. In August 2017, SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA with respect to its 505(b)(2) NDA for Trevyent. SteadyMed met with the FDA in November 2017, and the FDA indicated that SteadyMed does not need to conduct any clinical trials to prove the safety or efficacy of Trevyent. We are completing certain additional non-clinical activities related to Trevyent, and anticipate resubmitting the NDA during the first half of 2019. These activities include design verification testing on the final to-be-marketed Trevyent product, pharmacokinetic modeling and process validation. 
 


Orenitram 

         In 2013, the FDA approved Orenitram for the treatment of PAH patients to improve exercise capacity. The primary study that supported efficacy of Orenitram was a 12-week monotherapy study (FREEDOM-M) in which PAH patients were not on any approved background PAH therapy. In August 2018, we announced that our phase IV study of Orenitram called FREEDOM-EV had met its primary endpoint of delayed time to first clinical worsening event. In particular, the preliminary results showed that Orenitram, when taken with an oral PAH background therapy, decreased the risk of a morbidity/mortality event versus placebo by 26 percent (p=0.0391). In December 2018, we submitted a supplement to our NDA to the FDA seeking approval for a label amendment reflecting the FREEDOM-EV results, and we are evaluating whether the results could support marketing applications for Orenitram outside the United States. Additional FREEDOM-EV data were presented at a medical conference in January 2019, including a 61 percent decrease in the risk of disease progression for patients taking Orenitram, when compared to placebo (p=0.0002). In addition, in participants for which data are available (89 percent), Orenitram was associated with a 37 percent decreased risk of mortality compared with placebo (p=0.0324) at study closure (which includes additional data accrued in the open-label extension study). 
         Secondary endpoints in the FREEDOM-EV study are summarized below: 
 

 Change in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) from baseline.  The median 6MWD
trended toward improvement at week 24 (Hodges-Lehmann treatment estimate: 7 meters; p=0.0913). Median 6MWD improved with Orenitram at weeks 36 (13 meters; p=0.0094) and 48 (21 meters; p=0.0008)
compared to placebo. 
 Change in Borg dyspnea score and WHO functional class from baseline.  When
classified categorically as 'improved', 'no change', or 'deteriorated', participants in the Orenitram group exhibited a positive shift in Borg dyspnea score and WHO functional class compared to
placebo at weeks 24, 36, and 48 (p<0.05, all). 
Change in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels
from baseline. NT-proBNP levels were significantly improved with Orenitram at weeks 24 and 36 (p<0.0001, both). 
 Change in combined 6MWD and Borg dyspnea score from baseline.  Combined 6MWD
and Borg dyspnea score was significantly improved with Orenitram when assessed at week 24 compared to placebo (p=0.0057). 

         We expect to discuss the FREEDOM-EV results in further detail at upcoming medical conferences. 
         We are also enrolling patients in a study of Orenitram (SOUTHPAW) to treat WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension (specifically associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction). There are presently no FDA approved therapies indicated for the treatment of WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension.

Tysuberprost 

         In 2012, we completed a phase I safety study of esuberaprost, a single-isomer orally bioavailable prostacyclin analogue, and the data suggested that dosing esuberaprost four times a day was tolerable. We believe that esuberaprost and treprostinil have differing prostacyclin receptor-binding profiles, and we are studying the potential safety and efficacy benefits for patients when used in combination. We also believe that inhaled treprostinil and oral esuberaprost have complementary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, which indicate that they should provide greater efficacy in combination. We refer to the use of esuberaprost and Tyvaso therapies in combination with each other as Tysuberprost. In March 2017, we completed enrollment of our phase III registration study called BEAT to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso for patients with PAH who show signs of deterioration on Tyvaso or have a less than optimal response to Tyvaso treatment. We anticipate announcing the results of the  BEAT study during the first half of 2019. 
 


Unituxin 

         Under our BLA approval for Unituxin, the FDA has imposed certain post-marketing requirements and post-marketing commitments on us. We are conducting additional clinical and non-clinical studies to satisfy these requirements and commitments. While we believe we will be able to complete these studies, any failure to satisfy these requirements or commitments could result in penalties, including fines or withdrawal of Unituxin from the market, unless we are able to demonstrate good cause for the failure. 
         In addition, we are conducting a study (DISTINCT) of Unituxin in adult patients with small cell lung cancer, which is another GD2-expressing cancer. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the phase II portion of the study, and commenced the phase III portion of the study following an interim safety review. The phase III portion of the DISTINCT study is now fully enrolled with 472 patients, and we expect to announce the results by the first quarter of 2020. We are also conducting preclinical research to determine Unituxin's potential activity against other types of GD2-expressing tumors. These research and development efforts into new indications for Unituxin have been substantially outsourced to a contract research organization called Precision Oncology, LLC. 
         Unituxin therapy is associated with severe side effects, including infections, infusion reactions, hypokalemia, hypotension, pain, fever, and capillary leak syndrome. In post-approval use of Unituxin, the adverse reactions of prolonged urinary retention, transverse myelitis, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome have been observed. Unituxin's label also includes a boxed warning related to serious infusion reactions and neurotoxicity. 
         Finally, we are developing a fully humanized (non-chimeric) version of dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin. We expect this new version to reduce some of the side effects associated with Unituxin, which is a chimeric composed of a combination of mouse and human proteins. 
 


Tyvaso 

         In October 2017, we received FDA approval of a supplement to our NDA for Tyvaso, covering a new inhalation device as part of the Tyvaso Inhalation System. The new device, called the TD-300/A, was designed based on physician and prescriber feedback, and is intended to aid patient compliance and enhance ease of use. In addition, we are engaged in research and development efforts into new devices to further optimize the delivery of inhaled treprostinil, including a pro re nata (as needed) device called Spiresta. 
         We are enrolling a phase III registration study called INCREASE, which is a study of Tyvaso in patients with WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (specifically associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or combined pulmonary fibrosis and 
 14

   emphysema). This study is now over 75 percent enrolled. We are also enrolling a phase III registration study called PERFECT, which is a study of Tyvaso in patients with WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are presently no FDA approved therapies indicated for the treatment of WHO Group 3 pulmonary hypertension. 
 


Treprostinil Technosphere 

         In September 2018, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement with MannKind Corporation (MannKind) for the development and commercialization of a dry powder formulation of treprostinil called Treprostinil Technosphere for the treatment of PAH. The agreement became effective on October 15, 2018. Treprostinil Technosphere incorporates the dry powder formulation technology and Dreamboat® inhalation device technology used in MannKind's Afrezza® (insulin human) Inhalation Powder product, which was approved by the FDA in 2014. If the FDA approves Treprostinil Technosphere, we believe this new inhaled treprostinil therapy will provide substantial lifestyle benefits to PAH patients, as compared with Tyvaso therapy, because it will be: (1) less time consuming to administer and easier to maintain as the device and drug will be provided in a pre-filled, single use disposable cassette eliminating the need for cleaning and filling; and (2) mobile and more convenient as the compact design of MannKind's Dreamboat device and drug cassettes used with Treprostinil Technosphere can easily fit into the patient's pocket and do not require electricity. We also have the right to develop a single-use device based on MannKind's Cricket® design. The Cricket device would come pre-loaded with treprostinil and would be discarded immediately after use. In contrast, we envision each Dreamboat device would be used for up to two weeks before it is replaced with a new device. 
         Under our agreement with MannKind, we are responsible for global development, regulatory and commercial activities related to Treprostinil Technosphere. We plan to commence a clinical study (called BREEZE) during the first half of 2019 to evaluate the safety of switching PAH patients from Tyvaso to Treprostinil Technosphere, as well as a pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. The FDA has indicated that these two studies, if successful, will be the only clinical studies necessary to support FDA approval. We and MannKind will share responsibility for manufacturing clinical supplies and initial commercial supplies of Treprostinil Technosphere. We will manufacture long-term commercial supplies. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid MannKind $45.0 million following the effectiveness of the agreement in October 2018, and we are required to make potential milestone payments to MannKind of up to $50.0 million upon the achievement of specific development targets. MannKind is also entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on our net sales of the product. In addition, we have the option, in our sole discretion, to expand the license to include other active ingredients for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. We will pay MannKind up to $40 million in additional option exercise and development milestone payments for each product (if any) added to the license pursuant to this option, as well as a low double-digit royalty on our net sales of any such product. 
         We also entered into a research agreement with MannKind under which MannKind will conduct research related to products outside the scope of the licensing and collaboration agreement. We paid MannKind $10.0 million in consideration for its performance under the research agreement. 
 


Aurora-GT 

         We are enrolling a phase II/III study (called SAPPHIRE) of a gene therapy product called Aurora-GT, in which a PAH patient's own endothelial progenitor cells are isolated, transfected with the gene for human endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS), expanded ex-vivo and then delivered to the same patient. This product is intended to rebuild the blood vessels in the lungs that are destroyed by PAH. This study is being conducted in Canada, and is sponsored by Northern Therapeutics, Inc., a Canadian entity in which we have a 49.7 percent voting stake and a 71.8 percent financial stake. We have the 
 15

   exclusive right to pursue this technology in the United States, and plan to seek FDA approval of Aurora-GT if SAPPHIRE is successful. 
 


SM04646 

         In September 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Samumed LLC (Samumed) providing us exclusive U.S. and Canadian rights to SM04646, a phase I development-stage Wnt pathway inhibitor being developed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The Wnt pathway is one of the primary signaling pathways essential for the normal development of all multicellular animals, and for the growth and maintenance of various adult tissues. Recent evidence suggests that aberrant Wnt signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease such as IPF. SM04646 is currently undergoing a phase I clinical trial. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for SM04646 for the treatment of IPF. Under our agreement with Samumed, we paid Samumed $10 million up-front, and we will pay Samumed additional consideration of up to $340 million in developmental milestone payments, plus up to low double-digit royalties on our net sales of the product. Under the terms of the agreement, our subsidiary, Lung Biotechnology PBC, will conduct and fund all development, regulatory and commercialization activities for SM04646 in the United States and Canada. Samumed retains development and commercialization rights for SM04646 for all markets outside of these two countries. 
 


Ralinepag 

         In November 2018, we entered into a global license agreement with Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Arena), providing us exclusive rights to ralinepag, a next-generation, oral, selective and potent IP prostacyclin receptor agonist in development for the treatment of PAH. In January 2019, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the license agreement, (1) Arena granted to us perpetual, irrevocable and exclusive rights throughout the universe to develop, manufacture and commercialize ralinepag; (2) Arena transferred to us certain other assets related to ralinepag, including, among others, related domain names and trademarks, permits, certain contracts, inventory, regulatory documentation, Investigational New Drug (IND) Application No. 109021 (related to ralinepag) and non-clinical, pre-clinical and clinical trial data; and (3) we assumed certain limited liabilities from Arena, including, among others, all obligations arising after the closing under the assumed contracts and the IND described above; and (4) we paid Arena an upfront payment of $800.0 million. We will also pay Arena (1) a one-time payment of $250.0 million for the first, if any, marketing approval we receive in the United States for an inhaled version of ralinepag to treat PAH; (2) a one-time payment of $150.0 million for the first, if any, marketing approval we receive in any of Japan, France, Italy, the UK, Spain or Germany for an oral version of ralinepag to treat any indication; and (3) low double-digit, tiered royalties on net sales of any pharmaceutical product containing ralinepag as an active ingredient, subject to certain adjustments for third party license payments. 
         In 2017, Arena announced topline results from a 22-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II trial evaluating the tolerability and safety of ralinepag, and the effectiveness of ralinepag in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and improving exercise capacity. In this trial, 40 patients with PAH received ralinepag and 21 received placebo. Topline results showed statistically significant improvement of both absolute and percentage change from baseline in PVR. Patients on ralinepag also demonstrated numerical improvement in 6MWD, but as the study was not powered to show a difference in 6MWD from placebo, this was a not a statistically-significant finding. The safety and tolerability profiles were in line with other oral prostacyclin-class therapies. 
         We are continuing the ongoing phase III ADVANCE OUTCOMES study initiated by Arena, which is an event-driven study of ralinepag in PAH patients, with a primary endpoint of time to first clinical event. We are also planning two additional phase III studies, called ADVANCE CAPACITY and ADVANCE ENDURANCE, studying the effect of ralinepag on exercise capacity in PAH patients (with 
 16

   primary endpoints of change in peak oxygen uptake via cardiopulmonary exercise test and change in six-minute walk distance, respectively). All three of these studies are global, multi-center, placebo-controlled trials of patients on approved oral background PAH therapies. These studies collectively provide us with multiple potential avenues for FDA approval of ralinepag. 
         Upon closing, we also assumed Arena's existing outlicense of ralinepag to Everest Medicines in the following territories: the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Macau and Taiwan. 
 


Organ Manufacturing 

         Each year, end-stage organ failure kills millions of people. A significant number of these patients could have benefited from an organ transplant. Unfortunately, the number of usable, donated organs available for transplantation has not grown significantly over the past half century while the need has soared. Our long-term goals are aimed at addressing this shortage. With advances in technology, we believe that creating an unlimited supply of tolerable manufactured organs is now principally an engineering challenge, and we are dedicated to finding engineering solutions. Since 2011, we have been engaged in research and development of a variety of technologies designed to increase the supply of transplantable organs and tissues and improve outcomes for transplant recipients. These programs include preclinical research and development of alternative tissue sources through tissue and organ xenotransplantation, regenerative medicine, biomechanical lungs, and other technologies to create engineered organs and organ tissues. Although our primary focus is on engineered lungs, we are also developing technology for other engineered organs, such as kidneys and hearts, and our manufactured lungs, kidneys and hearts have set records for viability in FDA-required animal models. In February 2018 we reached a significant milestone by achieving 30-day survival of our genetically modified porcine lungs in FDA-required animal models. We are also developing technologies to improve outcomes for lung transplant recipients and to increase the supply of donor lungs through ex-vivo lung perfusion. While we continue to develop and commercialize therapies for rare and life-threatening conditions, we view organ manufacturing as the ultimate technology solution for a broad array of diseases, many of which (such as PAH) have proven incurable thus far through more traditional pharmaceutical and biologic therapies. For this reason, in 2015 we created a wholly-owned public benefit corporation called Lung Biotechnology PBC, chartered with the express purpose of "address[ing] the acute national shortage of transplantable lungs and other organs with a variety of technologies that either delay the need for such organs or expand the supply." 
   Sales and Marketing 
         Our marketing strategy for our commercial PAH products is to use our sales and marketing teams to reach out to the prescriber community to: (1) increase PAH awareness; (2) increase understanding of the progressive nature of PAH and the importance of early treatment; and (3) increase awareness of our commercial products and how they fit into the various stages of disease progression and treatment. 
 Distribution of Commercial Products 
 


United States Distribution of Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram, and Unituxin 

         We distribute Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram throughout the United States through two contracted specialty pharmaceutical distributors: Accredo Health Group, Inc. and its affiliates, including Curascript SD Specialty Distribution (collectively Accredo), and CVS Specialty. These distributors are required to maintain certain minimum inventory levels in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply to patients who are prescribed our therapies. We compensate Accredo and CVS Specialty on a fee-for-service basis for certain ancillary services in connection with the distribution of these products. If any of our distribution agreements expire or terminate, we may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase any unsold Remodulin, Tyvaso or Orenitram inventory held by our distributors. 
 17

           These specialty pharmaceutical distributors are responsible for assisting patients with obtaining reimbursement for the cost of our treprostinil-based products and providing other support services. Under our distribution agreements, we sell each of our treprostinil-based products to these distributors at a transfer price that we establish. We have also established patient assistance programs in the United States, which provide our treprostinil-based products to eligible uninsured or under-insured patients at no charge. Accredo and CVS Specialty assist us with the administration of these programs. 
         We distribute Unituxin throughout the United States through an exclusive distribution agreement with ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (ASD), an affiliate of AmerisourceBergen Corporation. Under this agreement, we sell Unituxin to ASD at a transfer price that we establish, and we pay ASD fees for services provided in connection with the distribution and support of Unituxin. 
         To the extent we increase the price of any of these products, increases are typically in the single-digit percentages per year. 
 


United States Distribution of Adcirca 

         Under our manufacturing and supply agreement with Lilly, Lilly manufactures and distributes Adcirca on our behalf through its wholesaler network in the same manner that it distributes its own pharmaceutical products. Under the terms of this agreement, we take title to Adcirca upon completion of its manufacture by Lilly. Adcirca is shipped to customers in accordance with purchase orders received by Lilly. Upon shipment, Lilly sends an invoice and collects the amount due from the customer subject to customary discounts and rebates, if any. Although Lilly provides these services on our behalf, we maintain the risk of loss as it pertains to inventory, product returns and non-payment of invoices. The manufacturing and supply agreement will continue in effect until the December 31, 2020 expiration or earlier termination of our license agreement for Adcirca. Lilly retains authority under the license agreement for all regulatory activities with respect to Adcirca, as well as its retail pricing, which has been and is expected to remain at price parity with Cialis. Since receiving FDA approval of Adcirca, Lilly has generally increased the net wholesale price of Adcirca two or three times each year by approximately nine to ten percent each time. We have also established a patient assistance program in the United States, which provides Adcirca to eligible uninsured or under-insured patients at no charge. 
 


International Distribution of Remodulin and Tyvaso 

         We currently sell Remodulin outside the United States to various distributors, each of which has exclusive distribution rights in one or more countries within Europe, Israel and the Middle East, Asia and South and Central America. We sell Tyvaso commercially to distributors that have exclusive distribution rights in Israel and Argentina. We also distribute Remodulin in Canada through a specialty pharmaceutical wholesaler, and plan to distribute Unituxin in Canada through the same wholesaler upon its commercial launch, which is planned for the first half of 2019. In some of the European markets where we are not licensed to market Remodulin, such as Spain and the United Kingdom, we sell (but do not market) Remodulin on a named-patient basis in which therapies are approved for individual patients by a national medical review board, hospital or health plan on a case-by-case basis. We also maintain similar named-patient programs for Tyvaso in certain countries. 
 


Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market Exclusivity 

         Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others in the United States and worldwide. Many of these proprietary rights stem from licenses and other strategic relationships with third parties. 
 18

   In addition to intellectual property rights, U.S. and international regulatory authorities often provide periods of market exclusivity for manufacturers of biopharmaceutical products. 
         Patents provide the owner with a right to exclude others from practicing an invention. Patents may cover the active ingredients, uses, formulations, doses, administrations, delivery mechanisms, manufacturing processes and other aspects of a product. The period of patent protection for any given product generally depends on the expiration date of various patents and may differ from country to country according to the type of patents, the scope of coverage and the remedies for infringement available in a country. Most of our commercial products and investigational products are protected by patents that expire on varying dates. 
         Significant legal questions exist concerning the extent and scope of patent protection for biopharmaceutical products and processes in the United States and elsewhere. Accordingly, there is no certainty that patent applications owned or licensed by us will be issued as patents, or that our issued patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors. Once issued, patents are subject to challenge through both administrative and judicial proceedings in the United States and other countries. Such proceedings include re-examinations, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews and interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as opposition proceedings before the European Patent Office. Litigation may be required to enforce, defend or obtain our patent and other intellectual property rights. Any administrative proceeding or litigation could require a significant commitment of our resources and, depending on outcome, could adversely affect the scope, validity or enforceability of certain of our patent or other proprietary rights. 
 


Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram Proprietary Rights 

         We have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications covering our treprostinil-based products, Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. We have been granted two patents related to manufacturing treprostinil that expire in 2028 and are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book (see Orange Book below), for Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. 
         In addition to the treprostinil patents noted above, we have other patents specific to our individual treprostinil-based products, including the following: 
 

 Remodulin.  We have been granted three U.S. patents covering an improved
diluent for Remodulin, which expire in 2028 and 2029. We have another patent covering intravenous administration of Remodulin with certain diluents, which expires in 2024. We have been granted another
patent covering a treprostinil formulation with a citrate buffer, which expires in 2024. All five of these patents are listed in the Orange Book. 
 Tyvaso.  We have been granted two U.S. patents, as well as patents in other
countries, for Tyvaso that cover methods of treating PAH by inhaled delivery. These patents expired in the United States in 2018 and will expire in various countries throughout the world in 2020. We
have also been granted two patents directed to a method of treating pulmonary hypertension and a kit for treating pulmonary hypertension. These two patents expire in 2028 and are listed in the Orange
Book. Counterparts to these two patents are issued in several other countries. 
 Orenitram.  Our patents for Orenitram cover methods of use for treating PAH,
orally administered formulations, controlled moisture storage and manufacturing methods, as well as those covering controlled release formulations licensed to us by Supernus
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Supernus). These patents will expire in the United States between 2024 and 2031 and in various countries throughout the world between 2024 and 2030. 

         We have additional pending U.S. and international patent applications related to Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. 
 19

   


Orange Book 

         In seeking approval of a drug through an NDA or upon issuance of new patents following approval of an NDA, applicants are required to submit to the FDA each patent that has claims covering the applicant's product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents submitted is then published in the Orange Book. See  Governmental RegulationPatent Term and Regulatory Exclusivity below for further details. Remodulin currently has eight unexpired Orange Book-listed patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2029. Tyvaso currently has four unexpired Orange Book listed patents expiring in 2028. Orenitram currently has twelve unexpired Orange Book listed patents with expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2031. Additional patent applications are pending, and if granted, may be eligible for listing in the Orange Book. 
 


Regulatory Exclusivity 

         Remodulin's regulatory exclusivity in the United States and Europe has expired. In 2010, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for Tyvaso, which resulted in an orphan exclusivity period that expired in July 2016. In 2004, the EMA designated Tyvaso an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of both PAH and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, which would confer a ten-year exclusivity period commencing if and when we obtain marketing approval. As a result of FDA approval of our NDA for Orenitram as a new dosage form, Orenitram had three years of market exclusivity for PAH, which expired in December 2016. A request for orphan drug designation for Orenitram was denied by the FDA, and we are currently challenging that denial in litigation pending before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. 
 


Supernus License 

         In 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Supernus to use certain of its technologies in manufacturing Orenitram. Under the agreement, we paid Supernus certain amounts upon the achievement of specified milestones based on the development and commercial launch of Orenitram for PAH, and we would be obligated to make additional milestone payments if we develop Orenitram for a second indication. In addition, the agreement provides that we will pay a single-digit percentage royalty based on net worldwide sales. This royalty will be paid for approximately twelve years commencing with the first product sale, which occurred in the second quarter of 2014. 
 


Generic Competition 

         We settled litigation with each of Sandoz, Teva, Par and Dr. Reddy's related to their ANDAs seeking FDA approval to market generic versions of Remodulin before the expiration of certain of our U.S. patents. Under the terms of our settlement agreements, Sandoz has been permitted to market its generic version of Remodulin in the United States since June 2018, and Teva, Par and Dr. Reddy's have been permitted to launch their generic versions in the United States since December 2018. To date, both Sandoz and Par have received tentative approval for their ANDAs, but to our knowledge, no generic company has begun to sell its generic version of Remodulin in the United States. 
         We also settled litigation with Actavis related to its ANDA seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Orenitram before the expiration of certain of our U.S. patents. Under the settlement agreement, Actavis can market its generic version of Orenitram in the United States beginning in June 2027, although Actavis may be permitted to enter the market earlier under certain circumstances. 
         We also settled litigation with Watson related to its ANDA seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Tyvaso before the expiration of certain of our U.S. patents. Under the settlement agreement, Watson can market its generic version of Tyvaso in the United States beginning in January 2026, although Watson may be permitted to enter the market earlier under certain circumstances. 
 20

           As a result of our settlements with Sandoz, Teva, Par and Dr. Reddy's, we expect to see generic competition for Remodulin from these companies in the United States beginning sometime in 2019. As a result of our settlements with Watson and Actavis, we expect to see generic competition for Tyvaso and Orenitram in the United States beginning as early as 2026 and 2027, respectively. Competition from these generic companies could reduce our net product sales and profits. In addition, while we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights related to our products, there can be no assurance that we will prevail in defending our patent rights, or that additional challenges from other ANDA filers or other challengers will not surface with respect to our products. Our patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover one or more generic forms of our products. If any ANDA filer were to receive approval to sell a generic version of our products and/or prevail in any patent litigation, the affected product(s) would become subject to increased competition, which could reduce our net product sales and profits. 
         A U.S. patent for Adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension expired in November 2017, and two remaining patents have been invalidated. In May 2017, we amended our Adcirca license agreement with Lilly to extend the term of the agreement through December 2020 and to amend the economic terms of the agreement following the expiration of a patent covering Adcirca in November 2017. As a result of this amendment, beginning December 1, 2017, our royalty rate on net product sales of Adcirca increased from five percent to ten percent, and we are required to make milestone payments to Lilly equal to $325,000 for each $1,000,000 in net product sales. Adcirca's cost of product sales as a percentage of Adcirca's net product sales has increased significantly since December 1, 2017 due to these cost increases. In August 2018, Mylan N.V. announced the launch of its generic version of Adcirca, which resulted in a material adverse impact on Adcirca net product sales, driven by a greater than 40 percent reduction in the number of bottles of Adcirca sold to distributors during the first full month following the availability of the generic version. This reduction has increased each month, resulting in a greater than 55 percent decrease in the average number of bottles sold per month during the period from generic launch in August 2018 through December 2018, compared to the average number of bottles sold per month in 2018 prior to generic launch. Additional companies announced the launch of generic versions of Adcirca in February 2019. In addition, we expect declines in patient demand will increase the amount of Adcirca inventory held by distributors and other downstream customers that expires unsold. Our allowance for product returns was $22.4 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. 
         Generic versions of Remodulin have been approved in Austria, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. The launch of generic versions in these countries, which occurred in January 2019 in Austria and is pending in the other countries, will likely lead to a decline in our international Remodulin revenues in 2019 due to increased competition and a contractual reduction in our transfer price for Remodulin sold by an international distributor for sales in countries in which the pricing of Remodulin is impacted by the launch of a generic version of Remodulin. The approval and launch of a generic version of Remodulin in other countries may follow. Our non-U.S. net product sales for Remodulin were $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
         Patent expiration, patent litigation and generic competition for any of our commercial PAH products could have a significant, adverse impact on our revenues, profits and stock price, and is inherently difficult to predict. For additional discussion, refer to the risk factor entitled, Our intellectual property rights may not effectively deter competitors from developing competing products that, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits, contained in Part I,  Item 1ARisk Factors included in this Report.

Adcirca License Agreement 

         In 2008, Lilly granted us an exclusive license to develop, market, promote and commercialize Adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the United States. We agreed to pay Lilly royalties based on our net product sales of Adcirca. Lilly retained the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing tadalafil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Adcirca, for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension outside of the United States and for the treatment of other diseases worldwide. Lilly retained authority for all regulatory activities with respect to Adcirca and for setting the wholesale price of Adcirca, which has been and is expected to continue to be at price parity with Cialis. In May 2017, we amended our Adcirca license agreement with Lilly in order to clarify and extend the term of the agreement and to amend the economic terms of the agreement following a patent expiry in November 2017. As amended, our license agreement expires on December 31, 2020. For additional discussion, refer to our Adcirca product description contained in Part I, Item 1Business OverviewProducts to Treat Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.
         We also agreed to purchase Adcirca at a fixed manufacturing cost. The agreement provides a mechanism, generally related to the increase in the national cost of pharmaceutical manufacturing, pursuant to which Lilly may raise the manufacturing cost of Adcirca. 
 


Unituxin Proprietary Rights and Regulatory Exclusivity 

         We have orphan drug exclusivity in the United States for Unituxin, expiring March 2022, which precludes the FDA from approving any application to market the same drug for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. In addition, approval of our BLA conferred a 12-year data exclusivity period through March 2027, during which the FDA may not approve a biosimilar for Unituxin. Under a non-exclusive license agreement with The Scripps Research Institute, we pay a royalty of one percent of Unituxin net sales. We have no patents covering Unituxin. 
 


Medtronic Agreements 

         As noted above, we are collaborating with Medtronic to develop and commercialize the Implantable System for Remodulin. Following FDA approval of the Implantable System for Remodulin, we entered into a commercialization agreement with Medtronic in February 2019, under which we will collaborate with Medtronic to commercialize the Implantable System for Remodulin in the United States. This agreement provides that the Implantable System for Remodulin will be exclusive to Remodulin, and further provides that we will not work with any third party to develop a competing implantable system to deliver Remodulin in the United States. The commercialization agreement has an initial term of five years, which may be extended for additional one-year terms if mutually agreed by the parties. Either party may terminate the commercialization agreement immediately for safety, quality or regulatory concerns, in the event of the other party's bankruptcy or insolvency, or in the case of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured following the relevant cure period. In addition, Medtronic may terminate the commercialization agreement upon 180 days' notice if Medtronic elects to discontinue its drug delivery business, and either party may terminate the commercialization agreement without cause on 180 days' notice to the other party, after the initial five-year term. For further details, see the section above entitled Research and DevelopmentImplantable System for Remodulin. 
         The Implantable System for Remodulin was developed under a development agreement with Medtronic that covers the treatment of PAH in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. The development agreement provides that the system will be exclusive to Remodulin in these countries, subject to certain conditions. We continue to work with Medtronic under the development agreement to fund further enhancements to the system. The development agreement has similar termination rights to the commercialization agreement described above.

Esuberaprost and the Toray Amended License Agreement 

         In 2000, we licensed from Toray Industries, Inc. (Toray) the exclusive right to develop and market beraprost for cardiovascular indications. Beraprost is a chemically stable oral prostacyclin analogue in a sustained release formulation, which is approved to treat PAH in Japan and certain other countries. This license gives us exclusive rights to develop beraprost and its variants (including esuberaprost) throughout North America, Europe, and certain other territories. We are currently developing esuberaprost under this license agreement in combination with Tyvaso. 
         Pursuant to a 2007 amendment to our license agreement with Toray, we issued 200,000 shares of our common stock to Toray. Toray has the right to request that we repurchase these shares (which have since split into 400,000 shares) upon 30 days prior written notice at the price of $27.21 per share. The 2007 amendment also provided for certain milestone payments during the development period and upon receipt of regulatory approval for beraprost in the United States or the EU. 
         In 2011, we amended our license agreement with Toray to reduce the royalty rates in exchange for a total of $50.0 million in equal, non-refundable payments to Toray over the five-year period ending in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, this obligation was fully satisfied. Toray has the right to terminate the license agreement in the event of a change of control of our company under certain circumstances. 
         In March 2017, we amended our license agreement with Toray to further reduce the royalty rate to single digits in exchange for contingent milestone payments in the event that we do not achieve certain clinical and regulatory events by certain dates. In addition, Toray granted us sole manufacturing rights for commercial esuberaprost. 
         The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for esuberaprost, which we expect would provide seven years of regulatory exclusivity if the FDA approves an NDA for esuberaprost following successful study results. We have one U.S. patent, which expires in 2031, covering a method of treating pulmonary hypertension using oral and inhaled prostacyclin therapies in combination, which we expect should be eligible for listing in the Orange Book if the FDA approves esuberaprost. 
 


DEKA Agreement 

         In December 2014, we entered into an exclusive agreement with DEKA to develop a pre-filled, semi-disposable system for subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin, which we refer to as RemUnity. Under the terms of the agreement, we are funding the development costs related to the semi-disposable system and will pay product fees and a single-digit royalty to DEKA based on commercial sales of the system and the Remodulin sold for use with the system. Our agreement with DEKA expires on the last to occur of twenty-five years from the first product launch under the agreement, or upon the expiration of the last valid claim of a patent licensed from DEKA under the agreement that covers the RemUnity system. Either party may terminate the agreement immediately upon a material breach by the other party that is uncured following the relevant cure period, or in the event of the other party's bankruptcy or insolvency. The RemUnity system is covered by issued patents and pending patent applications both in the U.S. and other countries. The expiration dates of currently issued U.S. patents range from 2027 through 2033. 
 


Trevyent 

         In 2016, the FDA granted orphan designation for Trevyent for the treatment of PAH. Thus, the FDA should grant orphan drug exclusivity if an NDA for Trevyent is approved; such exclusivity would extend for seven years from approval. Trevyent is protected by a variety of issued patents expiring at various dates ranging from 2024 to the early 2030s. Additional patent applications for Trevyent are pending. 
 23

   


Treprostinil Technosphere and the MannKind Agreement 

         Under our license agreement with MannKind, we have an exclusive license to a variety of granted and pending patents and patent applications related to treprostinil inhalation powder and the Dreamboat® and Cricket® devices, including multiple patent families covering the U.S. and other major market countries. These patents cover drug formulation, devices and device components, and manufacturing processes and intermediates. Expiration dates for issued patents range from the mid-2020s to the mid-2030s. Additional patents subject to pending patent applications, if issued, would have expiration dates in the late 2030s. Many of these patents would be eligible for listing in the Orange Book. For a description of the license agreement, please refer to the section above entitled Research and DevelopmentTreprostinil Technosphere.
 


Ralinepag and the Arena Agreement 

         Under our license agreement with Arena, we have an exclusive license to a variety of granted and pending patents and applications related to ralinepag covering drug formulation, manufacturing and dosage, among others. Many of these patents and patent applications would be eligible for listing in the Orange Book. Based on potential patent term extensions and additional patent filings, we believe U.S. patent protection for ralinepag will likely last through at least the mid-2030s. For a description of the license agreement, please refer to the section above entitled Research and DevelopmentRalinepag.
 


Other 

         We are party to various other license agreements related to therapies and technologies under development. These license agreements require us to make payments based on a percentage of sales if we are successful in commercially developing these therapies, and may require other payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. 
   Manufacturing and Supply 
         We manufacture our primary supply of Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin at our own facilities. In particular, we synthesize treprostinil, the active ingredient in Remodulin and Tyvaso, and treprostinil diolamine, the active ingredient in Orenitram, at our facility in Silver Spring, Maryland. We also produce dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin, at our Silver Spring facility. We also manufacture finished Tyvaso, Remodulin, and Unituxin at our Silver Spring facility. We manufacture Orenitram and we package, warehouse and distribute Remodulin, Tyvaso, Orenitram and Unituxin at our facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
         We maintain a two-year inventory of Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram based on expected demand, and we contract with third-party contract manufacturers to supplement our capacity, in order to mitigate the risk that we might not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities to meet patient demand. For example, Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions, LLC is approved by the FDA, the EMA and various other international regulatory agencies to manufacture Remodulin for us. We rely on Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc. to serve as an additional manufacturer of Tyvaso, and we rely entirely on Minnetronix Inc. to manufacture the nebulizer used in our Tyvaso Inhalation System. We obtained FDA approval of a third-party contract manufacturer to serve as an additional manufacturer of finished Unituxin drug product, and are constructing an additional facility to increase our manufacturing capacity for dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin. We have no plans to develop a redundant manufacturing source for finished Orenitram drug product. 
         Although we believe that additional third parties could provide similar products, services and materials, there are few companies that could replace our existing third-party manufacturers and suppliers. A change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacturing, distribution 
 24

   and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs. See also Item 1ARisk Factors included in this Report. 
   Competition 
         Many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular diseases and cancer. For the treatment of PAH, we compete with many approved products in the United States and the rest of the world, including the following: 


 Flolan, Veletri and generic epoprostenol.  Flolan (epoprostenol) is a
prostacyclin that is delivered by intravenous infusion. Glaxo began marketing Flolan in the United States in 1996. In 2008, the FDA approved Teva's version of generic epoprostenol for the treatment of
PAH. In 2010, Actelion (which was acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2017) commenced sales of Veletri, which is another version of intravenous epoprostenol; 
 Ventavis and Ilomedin®.  Approved in 2004 in the United States
and in 2003 in Europe, Ventavis (iloprost) is an inhaled prostacyclin analogue. Ventavis is currently marketed by Actelion in the United States and by Bayer Schering Pharma AG (Bayer) in Europe.
Iloprost is also marketed by Bayer in certain countries outside the United States in an intravenous form known as Ilomedin; 
 Tracleer®.  Tracleer (bosentan), an oral ETRA therapy for the
treatment of PAH, was approved in 2001 in the United States and in 2002 in Europe. Tracleer is marketed worldwide by Actelion. We anticipate generic bosentan could be launched in the United States in
the near term. Generic bosentan is already available in other countries; 
 Letairis.  Approved in 2007 in the United States, Letairis (ambrisentan) is
an oral ETRA therapy marketed by Gilead for the treatment of PAH. In 2008, Glaxo received marketing authorization from the EMA for Letairis in Europe, where it is known as Volibris®. In
2015, Gilead announced the positive results of the AMBITION study of ambrisentan and tadalafil as an up-front combination therapy for PAH, which we
believe has driven increased use of Letairis and Adcirca. We expect generic ambrisentan could be launched in the United States in the near term; 
 Revatio and generic sildenafil citrate.  Approved in 2005 in the United
States, Revatio (sildenafil citrate) is an oral PDE-5 inhibitor therapy manufactured by Pfizer. Revatio contains sildenafil citrate, the same active ingredient as Viagra. In 2012, several companies
began marketing generic formulations of sildenafil citrate; 
 Opsumit®.  Approved in 2013 in both the United States and in the
EU, Opsumit (macitentan) is an oral ETRA therapy marketed by Actelion for the treatment of PAH; 
 Adempas®.  Approved in 2013 in the United States and 2014 in the
EU, Adempas (riociguat) is an sGC stimulator, which targets a similar vasodilatory pathway as PDE-5 inhibitors and is approved for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and PAH. Adempas is an
oral therapy marketed by Bayer; and 
 Uptravi®.  Approved in the United States in December 2015 and by
the EMA in May 2016, Uptravi (selexipag) is an oral IP prostacyclin receptor agonist marketed by Actelion. Actelion also has applications pending in various other jurisdictions. Uptravi is also
marketed in Japan by Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. 

 25

           There are also a variety of investigational PAH therapies in the later stages of development, including the following:
 

Bardoxolone, an oral therapy being developed by Reata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for
treatment of PAH associated with connective tissue disease. Reata is enrolling patients in a phase III clinical trial; 
LIQ861, a dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed for deep-lung delivery using a
disposable inhaler being developed by Liquidia Technologies Inc. (Liquidia), which announced commencement of a phase III study in PAH patients in January 2018; 
Sotatercept, an injected TGF-beta modulator being developed by Acceleron Pharma, Inc.,
which announced the commencement of a phase II study in PAH patients in May 2018; 
CXA-10, an oral nitrated fatty acid compound being developed by Complexa Inc., which is
currently enrolling PAH patients in a phase II study; 
Tacrolimus, an oral therapy being developed by VIVUS Inc., which is currently enrolling
PAH patients in a phase II study; 
PB1046, a subcutaneously-injected, sustained release analogue of the native human vasoactive
intestinal peptide, which is being developed by PhaseBio Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and is currently undergoing a phase II study in PAH patients; 
CAM2043, a liquid crystal gel formulation of treprostinil being developed as a once-weekly
subcutaneous depot injection for PAH by Camurus AB. Camurus announced the positive results from a phase I clinical study in May 2018; 
INS1009, an inhaled nanoparticle formulation of a treprostinil prodrug being developed by
Insmed Incorporated for PAH. Insmed announced the completion of a phase I study in September 2016; and 
RVT-1201 (rodatristat ethyl), a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor being developed by Altavant
Sciences, Inc. to treat PAH. Altavant announced it expects to commence phase II clinical studies in PAH patients in 2019. 

         Oral non-prostacyclin therapies (such as PDE-5 inhibitors and ETRAs) are commonly prescribed as first-line treatments for the least severely ill PAH patients (functional class II patients). As patients progress in their disease severity (functional classes III and IV), less convenient approved therapies, such as inhaled prostacyclin analogues (such as Tyvaso) or infused prostacyclin analogues (such as Remodulin) are commonly added. Orenitram was the first approved oral prostacyclin-class therapy for PAH in the United States, and offers a less invasive and more convenient alternative therapy to Remodulin and Tyvaso. The use of available oral therapies could delay many patients' need for inhaled or infused prostacyclin therapy. As a result, the availability of oral therapies affects demand for our inhaled and infused products. 
         Orenitram faces direct competition from Uptravi, which is indicated to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH. As a result, many physicians may choose to prescribe Uptravi instead of Orenitram, which is indicated to improve exercise capacity. As noted above, however, Uptravi is an oral IP prostacyclin receptor agonist. While prostacyclin analogues such as Orenitram broadly mimic the effect of prostacyclin, IP prostacyclin receptor agonists bind selectively to the IP receptor, one of several prostacyclin receptors. In addition, Orenitram's label allows physicians flexibility to titrate each patient's dosing up to a level according to tolerability, without any stated maximum. By contrast, Uptravi's label limits uptitration to a specific maximum dose. Given the progressive nature of PAH, we believe many patients will initiate Orenitram or another one of our treprostinil-based therapies after their disease progresses on Uptravi. Furthermore, we believe the 
 26

   results of our FREEDOM-EV clinical study, which demonstrated that Orenitram delays time to clinical worsening and at study closure indicated a positive impact on survival, will result in increased use of Orenitram. 
         We have faced generic competition for Adcirca since the launch of generic tadalafil in the U.S. in August 2018, which has significantly reduced our Adcirca revenues. We will also face competition from generic pharmaceutical companies in the future. For example, we entered into settlement agreements with four generic drug companies permitting them to launch generic versions of Remodulin beginning in 2018. Although these companies have not yet launched generic versions of Remodulin, we anticipate generic competition in the U.S. for Remodulin in 2019. A generic version of Remodulin was launched in Austria in January 2019, and we anticipate generic competition for Remodulin in additional countries in Europe beginning in 2019. Finally, we have entered into settlement agreements with Actavis and Watson, permitting them to launch generic versions of Orenitram and Tyvaso in June 2027 and January 2026, respectively, or earlier under certain circumstances. For details regarding these and other potential generic competitors, see the section above entitled Patents and Other Proprietary Rights, Strategic Licenses and Market ExclusivityGeneric Competition. 
         Tyvaso may face competition from Liquidia if it obtains approval of LIQ861, a dry powder inhaled version of treprostinil. In addition, we expect Liquidia's products would compete directly with Treprostinil Technosphere, if approved. 
         Unituxin may face competition from Qarziba® (dinutuximab beta), a similar antibody product developed by Apeiron Biologics AG that is already approved in Europe to treat high-risk neuroblastoma. In October 2016, EUSA Pharma (UK) Ltd. announced it had acquired global commercialization rights to Qarziba, and plans to file for FDA approval. 
         We compete with the developers, manufacturers and distributors of all of the products noted above for customers, funding, access to licenses, personnel, third-party collaborators, product development and commercialization. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, product development, manufacturing and marketing, clinical trials and regulatory matters, than we have. 
   Governmental Regulation 
 


Pharmaceutical Product Approval Process 

         The research, development, testing, manufacture, promotion, marketing, distribution, sampling, storage, approval, labeling, record keeping, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the United States and in other countries. In the United States, failure to comply with requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and other federal statutes and regulations, may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of manufacturing or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 
         Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements is extremely costly and typically takes many years. The actual cost and time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA in the United States, the EMA in the EU and similar regulatory authorities in other countries. The steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States, which are similar to steps required in most other countries, include: (1) preclinical testing; (2) submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND); (3) clinical studies, including well-controlled clinical trials, in healthy 
 27

   volunteers and patients to establish safety, efficacy and dose-response characteristics for each drug indication; (4) submission of an NDA to the FDA; and (5) FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 


Preclinical Testing 

         Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as animal studies to explore toxicity and for proof-of-concept. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. 
 


Submission of IND 

         The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Absent FDA objection within 30 days after submission of an IND, the IND becomes effective and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 


Clinical Studies 

         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practices (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
         The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be approved by an institutional review board (IRB). An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a site to be halted temporarily or permanently for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
         Clinical trials in support of an NDA typically are conducted in sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. 
 

 Phase I involves the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics,
pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. 
 Phase II usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications,
explore tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. 
 Phase III trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies or advanced clinical trials, demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in a
larger number of patients, typically at geographically diverse clinical study sites, and permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and provide adequate information
for drug labeling. 
 Phase IV studies are often conducted following marketing approval, in order to meet regulatory requirements or to provide additional
data related to drug use. 

 28

   


FDA Approval Process 

         After successful completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is typically submitted to the FDA in the United States, and an MAA is typically submitted to the EMA in the EU. FDA approval of the NDA is required before the product may be marketed in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data related to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. 
         The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing. If the FDA determines that the application is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review, it may request additional information and decline to accept the application for filing until the information is provided. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for non-priority drugs are reviewed within ten to twelve months. Special pathways, including "accelerated approval," "fast track" status, "breakthrough therapy" status and "priority review" status are granted for certain drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. These special pathways can significantly reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA, but do not guarantee that a product will receive FDA approval. In May 2018, the Right to Try Act established a new regulatory pathway to increase access to unapproved, investigational treatments for patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions who have exhausted approved treatment options and who are unable to participate in a clinical trial. 
         The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. During the review process, the FDA also reviews the drug's product labeling to ensure that appropriate information is communicated to health care professionals and consumers. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure they are in compliance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). 
         After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, which generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those conditions have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even after a resubmission, the FDA may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 


Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements 

         Once an NDA is approved, the product is subject to continuing regulation. For instance, pharmaceutical products may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of their approved labeling. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing, labeling and advertising of prescription drugs, including direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. 
         Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports continue to be required following FDA approval of an NDA. In addition, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require 
 29

   post-marketing testing, including phase IV clinical studies, and/or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. Additionally, quality control as well as drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP requirements. Manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies. 
         Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may also result in (1) revisions to the approved labeling; (2) imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or (3) imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include: (1) restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; (2) fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; (3) refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; (4) product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or (5) injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 


Approval of Changes to an Approved Product 

         Certain changes to the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, equipment, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of an NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 


Orphan Drugs 

         Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an "orphan drug" in the United States if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation and FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease via a particular delivery method is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States. During the seven-year period, the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity, meaning that it has greater effectiveness or safety, or provides a major contribution to patient care (such as a change in delivery system). Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act), which became law in December 2016, expanded the types of studies that qualify for orphan drug grants. Orphan drug designation also may qualify an applicant for federal tax credits related to research and development costs. 
 


Patent Term and Regulatory Exclusivity 

         In 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Act created a faster approval process for generic drugs, called the ANDA. Generally, an ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength(s), route of administration, and dosage form as an approved drug and 
 30

   has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the approved drug. ANDA applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as "generic equivalents" to the approved drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original approved drug. In 2018, the FDA advanced policies aimed at promoting drug competition and patient access to generic drugs, such as issuing guidance about making complex generic drugs and the circumstances in which approval of a generic product application may be delayed. 
         NDA applicants are required to identify each patent whose claims cover the product or FDA-approved method of using the product. Upon product approval, these patents are listed in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Every ANDA applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) the required information for the original product was not filed or (2) every patent listed for the approved product in the Orange Book is either (a) expired or will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration or (b) invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Alternatively, for a patent covering an approved indication, an ANDA applicant may submit a statement to the FDA that the company is not seeking approval for the covered indication. 
         If the ANDA applicant has submitted a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
         The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the FDA regulatory review period for a product. This extension period is generally one-half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and its approval, subject to a maximum extension of five years. Similar patent term extensions are available under European laws. 
         An ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredient, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Following approval of an application to market a drug that contains previously approved active ingredients in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new condition of use that was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, the FDC Act provides three years of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA for such new condition of use, dosage form or strength that meets certain statutory requirements. 
 


Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

         Most drug products (other than biological products) obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDC Act, or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDC Act, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's finding of safety and efficacy data for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. 
 31



        Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA in which the applicant relies, at least in part, on information from studies made to show whether a drug is safe or effective that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use. A Section 505(b)(2) applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies, if it can establish that reliance on studies conducted for a previously-approved product is scientifically appropriate. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication for which the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has submitted data. 
         To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant relies on prior FDA findings of safety and efficacy, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the previously approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new active ingredient, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 


Marketing Pharmaceutical Products Outside the United States 

         Outside of the United States, our ability to market our products is also contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities. The foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with the FDA review and approval process set forth above, and the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country. 
 


Biologics 

         Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease, or condition, of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act and the PHSA. Biological products are approved for marketing via a BLA that follows an application process and carries approval requirements that are very similar to those for NDAs. To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there is a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction, or spread, of communicable diseases in the United States. 
         After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval. 
         The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be "biosimilar" to an FDA-licensed reference 
 32

   biological product to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity requires the absence of clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, which, absent a waiver, must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical study. Intricacies associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being addressed by the FDA. In July 2018, the FDA announced an action plan to encourage the development and efficient review of biosimilars, including the establishment of a new office within the agency that will focus on therapeutic biologics and biosimilars. 
         A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is approved as a biosimilar and also meets additional standards for interchangeability with the reference product, has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for a set period. Starting in March 2020, certain products currently approved as drugs under the FDC Act, such as insulin and human growth hormone, will be deemed to be biologics under the PHSA, which means they may face competition through the biosimilars pathway and they will not be eligible for the twelve-year period of exclusivity granted to new BLAs. 
         Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
 


Cell-and Tissue-Based Products 

         Manufacturers of cell- and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA's current good tissue practices (cGTP), which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable diseases. Cell and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products, if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use (a use different from the cell's origin). 
         The Cures Act established a new FDA Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies and Regenerative Advanced Therapy (RAT) designation, which makes a product eligible for FDA priority review and accelerated approval. Therapies that are eligible for RAT designation include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, or any combination product using these therapies, with certain exceptions. For RAT designation, the product also must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and the preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. 
 


U.S. Regulation of Medical Devices 

         Medical devices may also be subject to FDA approval and extensive regulation under the FDC Act. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes: Class I, Class II, or Class III. A higher class indicates a greater degree of risk associated with the device and a greater amount of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. 
         All devices, unless exempt by FDA regulation, must adhere to a set of general controls, including compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA's Quality System Regulation (QSR), which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements; facility registration and product listing; reporting of adverse medical events; truthful and non-misleading labeling; and promotion of the device consistent 
 33

   with its cleared or approved intended uses. Class II and III devices are subject to additional special controls and may require FDA clearance of a premarket notification (510(k)) or approval of a premarket approval application. 
         Most Class I devices are exempt from FDA premarket review or approval. Class II devices, with some exceptions, must be "cleared" by the FDA through the 510(k) process, which requires a company to show that the device is "substantially equivalent" to certain "predicate" devices already on the market. In November 2018, the FDA announced plans to significantly revise the 510(k) program to encourage reliance on modern predicates (e.g., predicates that are less than 10 years old). In January 2019, the FDA also finalized guidance on the alternative 510(k) pathway for well-known device types, the "Safety and Performance Based Pathway," which relies on modern performance-based criteria and current technological principles to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Class III devices, again with some exceptions, must be approved through a PMA. A PMA generally requires data from clinical trials that establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. A 510(k) application also sometimes requires clinical data. 
         The Cures Act requires the FDA to establish a program that would expedite access to devices that provide more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions, for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or which offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. In December 2018, the FDA published final guidance on this "breakthrough" devices pathway and announced plans to establish the Safer Technologies Program (STeP) to encourage the innovation and market entry of device technologies that are safer than current alternatives but that do not otherwise satisfy the breakthrough device criteria. 
         Clinical trials for medical devices are subject to similar requirements as clinical trials with respect to drugs or biologics. Clinical trials involving significant risk devices (e.g., devices that present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of human subjects) are required to obtain both FDA approval of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application and IRB approval before study initiation. Clinical trials involving non-significant risk devices are not required to submit an IDE for FDA approval but must obtain IRB approval before study initiation. 
         The FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers with respect to medical devices, similar to those for drugs and biologics. The FDA requires medical device manufacturers to comply with detailed requirements regarding the design and manufacturing practices, labeling and promotion, record keeping, and adverse event reporting. 
         States also impose regulatory requirements on medical device manufacturers and distributors. Failure to comply with the applicable federal or state requirements could result in, among other things: (1) fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; (2) recall or seizure of products; (3) operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of manufacturing; (4) refusing requests for approval of new products; (5) withdrawing approvals already granted; and (6) criminal prosecution. 
         The FDA also administers certain controls over the import and export of medical devices to and from the United States. Additionally, each foreign country subjects medical devices to its own regulatory requirements. In the EU, a single regulatory approval process has been created, and approval is represented by the CE Mark. 
 


Combination Products 

         A combination product is a product composed of a combination of two or more FDA-regulated product components or products, e.g., drug-device or device-biologic. A combination product can take a variety of forms, such as a single entity made by physically or chemically combining components, or a single unit made of separately packaged products. Each combination product is assigned a lead FDA Center, which has jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation, based on which constituent part 
 34

   of the combination product provides the primary mode of action, i.e., the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effect of the product. If the classification as a combination product or the lead Center assignment is unclear or in dispute, a sponsor may request a meeting, submit a Request for Designation (RFD), and the FDA will issue a designation letter within 60 calendar days of the filing of the RFD. Depending on the type of combination product, the FDA may require a single application for approval, clearance, or licensure of the combination product, or separate applications for the constituent parts. During the review of marketing applications, the lead Center may consult or collaborate with other FDA Centers. In 2017, the FDA released final documents addressing the application of cGMP requirements and classification issues related to combination products. 
         The Cures Act sets forth a number of provisions pertaining to combination products, such as procedures for negotiating disagreements between sponsors and FDA and requirements intended to streamline FDA premarket reviews of combination products that contain an already-approved component. For drug-device combination products, comprised of an FDA-approved drug and device primary mode of action, the Cures Act applies Hatch Waxman requirements to the premarket review process such that a patent dispute regarding the listed drug may result in the delay of the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of the combination product. Furthermore, the Cures Act applies exclusivity provisions (e.g., new chemical entity and orphan drug exclusivities) to the device clearance and approval process for combination products with a device primary mode of action. 
 


Government Reimbursement of Pharmaceutical Products 

         In the United States, many independent third-party health plans, and government health care programs, pay for patient use of our commercial products. Medicare is the federal program that provides health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons. Medicaid is the federal program jointly funded and administered by the states to provide health care benefits to participants who qualify based on income. Unituxin is administered entirely as an in-patient therapy and would typically be reimbursed under Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient hospital benefits. However, because Unituxin is indicated for the treatment of a pediatric cancer, Medicare beneficiaries are unlikely to receive this treatment. Remodulin and Tyvaso are reimbursed by the Medicare Part B program, which covers physician services and outpatient care. The Medicare Part B contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for Remodulin and Tyvaso according to statutory guidelines. As a condition of the inclusion of Adcirca and Orenitram in the Medicare Part D program, which provides a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit, we pay rebates to Medicare Part D plan sponsors that reimburse these products. State Medicaid programs also reimburse the cost of our commercial products at rates established by statutory guidelines. Because Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca, Orenitram and Unituxin are reimbursed by state Medicaid programs, we must pay a rebate to those state Medicaid programs. We are required by government contract to sell our commercial products under contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as 340B covered entities (entities designated by federal programs to receive drugs at discounted prices) at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our specialty distributors. These programs and contracts are highly regulated, are subject to regulatory changes and amendments that we cannot control, and impose restrictions on our business. Failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for our drugs, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under the federal healthcare programs, or debarment, and expose us to liability under federal and state false claims laws. The availability of adequate government reimbursement for our products may also be subject to regulatory changes and controls. We estimate that between 40-50 percent of Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram sales are reimbursed under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws and The Prescription Drug Marketing Act 

         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, or referring an individual for the furnishing of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and others. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to apply to anything of value including, for example, gifts, cash payments, donations, waivers of payment, ownership interests, and providing any item, service, or compensation for something other than fair market value. Violations of the AKS are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and liability under the False Claims Act (FCA). 
         The FCA prohibits any person from, among other things, presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, or making, or causing to be made, a false statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under the FCA for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates; for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; for violating the AKS; for materially deviating from statutorily required manufacturing standards; and on the basis of allegations related to certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion. Many states also have statutes or regulations similar to the AKS and the FCA, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include treble damages, civil penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment. 
         We are also subject to numerous other anti-bribery and anti-fraud laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law. 
         As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) imposes requirements and limitations upon the distribution of drugs and drug samples, and prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage and handling, as well as record keeping requirements for information regarding sample requests and distribution. The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. In addition, PDMA requires manufacturers and distributors to submit similar drug sample information to the FDA. 
 


The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) 

         The PPACA is intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States. Several provisions of the law, which have varying effective dates, have impacted us and have increased certain of our costs. The PPACA imposes an annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers, based on the manufacturer's sale of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to certain U.S. government programs during the preceding year; expands the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs) including the creation of new penalties for non-compliance; includes a 50 percent discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D participants in the coverage gap, or "donut hole"; and revised the definition of "average manufacturer price" for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of the Medicaid drug rebates paid to states. 
         In addition, the PPACA imposes new annual reporting requirements for pharmaceutical, biological and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and 
 36

   teaching hospitals. In addition, pharmaceutical, biological and device manufacturers are required to report annually investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements that have not yet been clarified. Further, the PPACA amends the intent requirement of the AKS and the federal criminal health care fraud statute. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
         In December 2017, Congress repealed a PPACA requirement that individuals obtain healthcare insurance coverage or face a penalty, which could decrease the number of patients who have coverage under health plans that pay for patient use of our products. 
 


21st Century Cures Act 

         The Cures Act, which was signed into law on December 13, 2016, contains a wide range of provisions designed to promote clinical research and streamline and expedite the FDA review and approval process. For example, the law clarifies the FDA's authority regarding drugs that target rare diseases, and broadens the type of data and information that may be used to support a drug or biologic application for a genetically targeted drug or variant protein targeted drug. The law requires the FDA to facilitate development programs for, and provides expedited review of, regenerative advanced therapies. The law further requires the FDA to establish a program to evaluate the use of real-world evidence, i.e., evidence from sources other than randomized clinical trials, to support the approval of certain drug and biological product applications and to satisfy post-approval requirements; in 2018, the FDA published a framework for evaluating real-world evidence. Other key provisions related to orphan drugs, combination products, and medical devices, are discussed separately above. 
 


State Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Marketing Laws 

         If not preempted by the PPACA, several jurisdictions require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses related to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare practitioners in those jurisdictions, or to obtain licenses for sales representatives and require them to satisfy educational and other requirements. Some of these jurisdictions also prohibit various marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of information related to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties or other civil enforcement action. 
 


Other Laws and Regulations 

         Numerous other statutory and regulatory regimes affect our business and operations. For example, our research and development efforts may be subject to laws, regulations and recommendations related to data privacy and protection, safe working conditions, laboratory practices, use of animals in research and development activities, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. Antitrust and competition laws may restrict our ability to enter into certain agreements involving exclusive license rights. Future legislation and administrative action will continue to affect our business, the extent and degree of which we cannot accurately predict.
