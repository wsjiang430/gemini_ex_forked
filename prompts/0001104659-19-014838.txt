ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 
Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. is an independent exploration and production company focused on the application of modern drilling, completion and production operations techniques in oil and liquids-rich basins in the onshore United States. Our operations are currently focused on exploration and production activities in the Mississippian Lime. Our corporate headquarters is located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware on October 25, 2011, to become a holding company for Midstates Petroleum Company LLC (Midstates Sub or Debtor Affiliate). In this Annual Report, references to Company, we, us, our, and Midstates when used in the present tense, prospectively or for historical periods, refer to Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and Midstates Sub.
 
On April 30, 2016, we filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2016, in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, our existing common shares were cancelled and on October 24, 2016, our new common shares issued in connection with our successful reorganization and emergence from Chapter 11 were listed and began trading on the NYSE MKT under the symbol MPO. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol MPO beginning on May 4, 2017. We currently lease office space in Tulsa, Oklahoma at 321 South Boston Avenue, Suite 1000, where our principal offices are located. The lease for our Tulsa office expires in 2026. We also lease one field office in Dacoma, Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2018, we had 85 employees.
 
On May 31, 2018, we closed on the sale of our Anadarko Basin assets for $58.0 million in cash ($54.1 million, net of closing adjustments).
 
We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). You may read and copy any documents filed by us with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Our filings with the SEC are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov.
 
We also make available on our website (http://www.midstatespetroleum.com) all of the documents that we file with the SEC, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with the SEC. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Financial Code of Ethics, and the charters of our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating and governance committee are also available on our website and in print free of charge to any stockholder who requests them. Requests should be sent by mail to 321 South Boston Avenue, Suite 1000; Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103, attention General Counsel.

Business Strategy
 
Our goal is to optimize capital investments and generate free cash flow. To achieve these objectives, we strive to:
 
·                  Operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner;
 
·                  Maintain a best in class cost structure to maximize the cash flow margin of our production;
 
·                  Prioritize free cash flow generation over production growth. We will optimize free cash flow generation by focusing on capital investments, optimizing our base production, and maintaining a low-cost structure; and
 
·                  Maintain maximum optionality by maintaining low net debt, balancing shareholder cash returns with replenishing inventory, and evaluating strategic alternatives within and outside of our current asset base.
 
For 2019, we intend to opportunistically achieve the best return on investments by maintaining both capital discipline and a low-cost structure.

Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization
 
On April 30, 2016 (the Petition Date), we filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Bankruptcy Court). Our Chapter 11 cases (the Chapter 11 Cases) were jointly administered under the case styled In re Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 16-32237. On September 28, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Confirming Debtors First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliate (the Confirmation Order), which approved and confirmed the First Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Midstates Petroleum Company, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliate as filed on the same date (the Plan). On October 21, 2016 (the Effective Date), we satisfied the conditions to effectiveness set forth in the Confirmation Order and in the Plan, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and we emerged from the Chapter 11 Cases. Further information is set forth in Note 2. Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization under Chapter 11 Proceedings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Upon our emergence on the Effective Date, we adopted fresh start accounting as required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP). We qualified for fresh start accounting because (i) the holders of existing voting shares of the pre-emergence debtor-in-possession received less than 50% of the voting shares of the post-emergence successor entity and (ii) the reorganization value of our assets immediately prior to confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims. We applied fresh start accounting as of October 21, 2016. Adopting fresh start accounting results in a new reporting entity for financial reporting purposes with no beginning retained earnings or deficit. The cancellation of all existing shares outstanding on the Effective Date and issuance of new shares in the reorganized Company caused a related change of control under US GAAP. As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, as well as the effects of the implementation of the Plan, our consolidated financial statements on or after October 21, 2016, are not comparable with our consolidated financial statements prior to that date. References to Successor Period relate to the financial position and results of operations for the period October 21, 2016, through December 31, 2016, and references to Predecessor Period refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company from January 1, 2016, through October 20, 2016.
 
Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations
 
Mississippian Lime
 
Our Mississippian Lime assets are located in Oklahoma and target the Mississippian Lime formation. At December 31, 2018, our acreage consisted of approximately 102,198 net (137,611 gross) prospective acres in the Mississippian Lime trend in Woods and Alfalfa Counties of Oklahoma, which we intend to develop using horizontal wells.
 
Our properties in this area represented 100% of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we held an average working interest and average net revenue interest of 77% and 62%, respectively, in this area.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our average daily production from our Mississippian Lime assets was as follows:
 

 | Year Ended December 31, 2018 | Year Ended December 31, 2017 
---------------------------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------
Oil (Bbls) | 4,768 | 5,108 
Natural gas liquids (Bbls) | 4,014 | 4,273 
Natural gas (Mcf) | 47,791 | 52,797 
Net Boe/day | 16,747 | 18,181 

Other
 
During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we closed on the sale of our oil and gas properties in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, which had approximately 12,894 net (19,888 gross) acres for $7.0 million in cash ($2.9 million, net after assumption of liabilities).
 
During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we closed on the sale of our Anadarko Basin assets, which had approximated 115,180 gross (90,361 net) acres for $58.0 million in cash ($54.1 million, net of closing adjustments).

Reserves Information
 
Estimated Proved Reserves
 
The following table sets forth our estimated net proved reserves by product and type using SEC pricing:
 

 | Oil (MBbls) | Natural Gas (MMcf) | NGLs (MBbls) | Total (MBoe) | PV-10 (1) (in thousands) 
------------------------------------+-------------+------------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------------------
Mississippian Lime: | | | | | 
Proved developed producing | 10,713 | 138,850 | 12,650 | 46,505 | 424,989 
Proved developed non-producing | 282 | 8,398 | 775 | 2,457 | 8,400 
Proved undeveloped | 7,070 | 63,265 | 5,846 | 23,460 | 146,261 
Total Proved at December 31, 2018 | 18,065 | 210,513 | 19,271 | 72,422 | 579,650 

 
(1)                                 We refer to PV-10 as the present value of estimated future net cash flows of estimated proved reserves as calculated in the respective reserves report using a discount rate of 10%. This amount includes projected revenues, estimated production costs, estimated future development costs and estimated cash flows related to future asset retirement obligations (ARO). PV-10 is a financial measure not defined under US GAAP. Accordingly, the following table reconciles total PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable US GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of PV-10 provides useful information because it is widely used by investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies without regard to specific income tax characteristics of such entities. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under US GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under US GAAP.
 
The following table provides a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted cash flows (in thousands):
 

 | As of December 31, 2018 | | As of December 31, 2017(1) | 
-----------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------+--------------------------------+--
PV-10 | $ | 579,650 | | $ | 558,133
Present value of future income tax, discounted at 10% | (13,374 | ) | (8,890 | )
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 566,276 | | $ | 549,243

 
(1)                                 The PV-10 and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2017 includes our Anadarko Basin assets, which were divested on May 31, 2018.
 
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 
The following table summarizes the changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during the year ended December 31, 2018 (in MBoe):
 

Proved undeveloped reserves, December 31, 2017 | 44,457 |

No less than annually, we review our five-year development schedule. This review encompasses many factors, including current year drilling results, forward pricing curve, returns expected of our drilling program, and cash available during the time period for drilling and shareholder returns, which would include cash on hand, cash generated by operations and cash from borrowings. As a result of our focus on optimizing free cash flow, keeping leverage to a minimum and optimizing drilling returns, we have prioritized development of two-mile laterals along with certain one-mile laterals with higher working interests. To accomplish our development schedule, we currently anticipate drilling to occur no later than 2020 and continue for approximately three years after that date. All undeveloped locations not able to be drilled utilizing our anticipated development schedule were excluded from the December 31, 2018 reserve report but continue to meet the definition of a proved undeveloped location from an engineering standpoint.
 
Independent Petroleum Engineers
 
Our estimated reserves and related future net revenues at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are based on reports prepared by our independent third-party reserves engineering firm Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (CGA), in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines in effect during such period as established by the SEC.
 
The reserve estimates shown herein for the periods indicated above have been independently evaluated by CGA, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. CGA was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-693. Within CGA, the technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the reserves report incorporated herein was Mr. Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been a practicing consulting petroleum engineer at CGA since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055) and has over 30 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over 29 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; he is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserve definitions and guidelines.
 
Technology Used to Establish Proved Reserves
 
Under Rule 4-10(a)(22) of Regulation S-X, as promulgated by the SEC, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
 
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, CGA employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data.
 
Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process
 
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers, land and geoscience professionals who work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to CGA in their reserves estimation process. The primary inputs to the reserves estimation process are comprised of technical information, financial data, ownership interests and production data. All field and reservoir technical information, which is updated annually, is assessed for validity when the reservoir engineers hold technical meetings with geoscientists, operations and land personnel to discuss field performance and to validate future development plans. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to their own set of internal controls over financial reporting. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field commodity price differentials are updated in the reserves database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are incorporated into the reserves database as well and verified to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Throughout each fiscal year, our technical team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserve estimates. Each quarter, estimated proved oil and gas reserves are presented to a committee of executives and key management for review and approval and annually, our development plan for proved undeveloped reserves are reviewed and approved by our executives and board of directors.

At December 31, 2018, Mitchell Craig Stephens, Corporate Reserves Engineer, was primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserve estimates and reported directly to our Senior Management Consultant. Mr. Stephens has more than 7 years of experience in the oil and gas industry, all in reservoir engineering and corporate reserves. Mr. Stephens spent the first portion of his career working for Chaparral Energy. While at Chaparral, Mr. Stephens primarily served as reservoir engineer for the Mississippian Lime team. Mr. Stephens has also worked for QEP Energy and Echo Energy where he also served as a reservoir engineer. Mr. Stephens graduated from the University of Tulsa in 2011 with a B.S degree in Petroleum Engineering.
 
Production, Revenues and Price History
 
Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities. The price that we receive for the oil, NGLs and natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. A decline in these commodity prices from their current levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. For additional information on these and other risks, see information set forth in Risk Factors.
 
The following table sets forth information regarding our oil, NGLs and natural gas production, revenues and realized prices and production costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, the Successor Period and the Predecessor Period. For additional details, see information set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

We divested our Hunton producing properties in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, during the year ended December 31, 2017. Further information is set forth in Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations above and Note 9. Acquisition and Divestitures of Oil and Gas Properties in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 (2)                           We divested our Anadarko Basin assets during the second quarter of 2018. As a result, we did not have proved reserves in this area at December 31, 2018. Further information is set forth in Summary of Oil and Gas Properties and Operations above and  Note 9. Acquisition and Divestitures of Oil and Gas Properties in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Productive Wells
 
The following table presents our total gross and net productive wells as of December 31, 2018:
 

 | Oil | Natural Gas | Total
-----------------------+-------+-------------+------
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net
Total productive wells | 486 | 379 | 12 | 7 | 498 | 386

 
Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of producing. Gross wells are the total number of productive wells in which we have working interests, and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. Each gross well completed in more than one producing zone is counted as a single well.
 
Acreage
 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the developed and undeveloped acreage in which we have a controlling interest as of December 31, 2018, for each of our operating areas. Acreage related to royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests is excluded from this summary:

 | Developed Acres | Undeveloped Acres | Total Acres
-------------------+-----------------+-------------------+------------
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Mississippian Lime | 75,200 | 57,796 | 62,411 | 44,402 | 137,611 | 102,198

Undeveloped Acreage Expirations
 
The following table sets forth the number of gross and net undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2018, that will expire over the next three years by operating area unless operations are commenced upon or production is established upon the acreage (or upon lands spaced or pooled therewith) or we make additional lease rental payments prior to the expiration dates:

 | Expiring 2019 | Expiring 2020 | Expiring 2021
-------------------+---------------+---------------+--------------
 | Gross | Net | Gross | Net | Gross | Net 
Mississippian Lime | 9,465 | 2,137 | 13,359 | 4,914 | 6,579 | 3,780

 
Our typical lease terms along with unit regulatory rules generally provide us flexibility to continue lease ownership through either establishing production or actively drilling prospects. To the extent we cannot commence drilling operations upon or establish production from certain leases in the Mississippian Lime asset, certain of the leases within that asset area will expire, unless extended or renewed.
 
Drilling Activity
 
The following table summarizes our drilling activity for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, the Successor Period and the Predecessor Period. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells:

 | Successor | | Predecessor |

As of December 31, 2018, there were no development wells awaiting completion; no development well was being drilled and no exploratory wells were being drilled.
 
Marketing and Major Purchasers
 
We sell our oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party purchasers. In our Mississippian Lime asset, the majority of our natural gas production is dedicated to one purchaser for the economic life of the relevant assets. For the year ended December 31, 2018, three purchasers accounted for 35%, 32% and 23%, respectively, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three purchasers accounted for 37%, 25% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue. For the Successor Period, two purchasers accounted for 40% and 29%, respectively, of our revenue. For the Predecessor Period, two purchasers accounted for 46% and 29%, respectively, of our revenue. Due to the nature of oil, NGLs and natural gas markets, we do not believe the loss of a single purchaser or a few purchasers would materially adversely affect our ability to sell such production.
 
We are party to a gas purchase, gathering and processing contract in our Mississippian Lime asset, which includes certain minimum NGLs volume commitments. To the extent we do not deliver natural gas volumes in sufficient quantities to generate, when processed, the minimum levels of recovered NGLs, we would be required to reimburse the counterparty an amount equal to the sum of the monthly shortfall, if any, multiplied by a fee of roughly $0.14 to $0.16 per gallon (subject to annual escalation). We have historically, and continue to currently, deliver at least the minimum volumes required under these contractual provisions.

Title to Properties
 
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct a preliminary review of the title to our properties. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a more thorough title examination and undertake any title curative that is deemed necessary to address any significant title discrepancies. To the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect any such significant defects affecting those properties, we are responsible for curing any such defects at our expense to the extent that any such defect impacts our ownership interest. Likewise, we may choose to notify other owners whose title is subject to a title defect so that they may undertake the necessary efforts to attempt to cure the applicable title defect at their own expense. Our oil and natural gas properties are generally subject to customary royalty interests or other burdens, and a majority of our properties are subject to liens to secure borrowings under our Exit Facility as well as liens for current taxes and other burdens, none of which we believe materially interfere with our ability to operate or develop such properties.
Seasonality
 
Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and the associated prices of, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Further, weather conditions could delay our drilling and production activities, which impacts our ability to achieve our overall business objectives. Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation.
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry is a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, attracting and retaining trained personnel and obtaining the equipment necessary to develop and produce reserves. We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors are large, well established companies and have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours. Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and successfully consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate properties for oil and natural gas production have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and produced during operations and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in any given area, and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas wells, as well as regulations and certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and/or individual wells.
 
Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on our industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Additionally, currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non-compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance from an environmental perspective. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), other regulatory and administrative agencies and bodies, as well as, the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or any such proceedings might affect the oil and natural gas industry as a whole, or our operations or business in particular.

Regulation of Transportation and Sales of Natural Gas
 
Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) and regulations issued under those statutes.
 
FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas. Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open access, non-discriminatory basis. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach that FERC has maintained since 1985 will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken by FERC will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.
 
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
 
Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a FERC-jurisdictional transmission function, the FERCs determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case by case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements.
 
Regulation of Production
 
The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these laws and regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction.
 
The failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulation
 
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational safety and health, the emission or discharge of materials into the environment and environmental and natural resource protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), analogous state agencies, and, in certain instances, citizens groups, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct drilling and other regulated activities; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close waste pits and plug abandoned wells; (v) impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and (vi) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions prohibiting some or all of our operations. These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.

Any changes in federal or state environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of applicable enforcement policies that result in more stringent or costly well construction, drilling, operating methods, water management or completion activities, waste handling, storage, transport, or disposal requirements, or remediation requirements or that limit or otherwise restrict the emission of certain listed pollutants or organic compounds from wells or surface equipment could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including costs for remediation or any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with existing or any new laws and regulations or that future compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
 
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
 
Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These classes of persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at a site where a release has occurred. Under CERCLA, these responsible parties may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of removing and cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible parties the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. Despite the petroleum exclusion of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses crude oil and natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
 
Certain of our operations or activities may also be subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (RCRA), and comparable state statutes. RCRA imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Under the authority of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although RCRA currently exempts certain drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas from regulation as hazardous wastes, we can provide no assurance that this exemption will be preserved in the future. From time to time the EPA and analogous state agencies have considered repealing or modifying this exemption, and citizens groups have also petitioned the agency to consider its repeal. For example, in December 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia approved a consent decree between the EPA and environmental groups to address EPAs alleged failure to review the RCRA E&P waste exemption. The consent decree requires the EPA by March 2019 to review the E&P waste exemption and issue either a proposed rulemaking to revise the exemption or a determination that revision of the exemption is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking, the consent decree requires that EPA take final action by no later than July 2021. Repeal or modification of the RCRA E&P waste exemption or similar exemptions under state law could have a significant impact on our operating costs as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. The impact of future revisions to environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted. In any event, at present, these excluded wastes are subject to regulation as RCRA nonhazardous wastes. In addition, we generate petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes in the course of our operations that may become regulated as RCRA hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
 
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for numerous years to explore and produce oil and natural gas. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes was not under our control. We could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination.

Air Emissions
 
The Clean Air Act, as amended (CAA), and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects, and we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards that require the reduction of methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed oil and gas emissions sources (the 2016 NSPS Rules). However, following attempts to stay portions of the 2016 NSPS Rules, the EPA in September 2018 proposed amendments that would relax certain of the requirements of the 2016 NSPS Rules. Separately, in April 2018, several states filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the EPA to issue performance standards that require the reduction of methane emissions from existing oil and gas emissions sources. Compliance with such regulations could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the drilling programs equipment and production facilities, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our capital expenditures and drilling programs operating costs, which could adversely impact our business and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant.
Climate Change
 
Based on the EPAs determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and other climatic changes, the agency has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal CAA that, among other things, establish pre-construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Facilities required to obtain permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet best available control technology standards that typically will be established by the states. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which include certain of our operations. In June 2016, the EPA published the 2016 NSPS Rules, which require the reduction of methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas sector.  In September 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rulemaking that could substantially change the obligations associated with methane emissions; that rulemaking has not been finalized and therefore future obligations remain uncertain. In November 2016, the U.S. Department of Interiors Bureau of Land Management (BLM) finalized similar rules to reduce methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas operations on public lands. However, in September 2018, the BLM issued a final rule rescinding its 2016 methane rules, and litigation challenging the rescission is pending. Although substantial uncertainty exists with respect to implementation of these and other GHG regulations, given the long-term trend towards increasing regulation, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility at the federal level. In addition, several states have separately imposed their own regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas production activities, and a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.
 
On an international level, the United States is one of almost 200 nations that have agreed to participate in the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions; the Agreement entered into force in November 2016. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Various state and local governments have publicly committed to continue to further the goals of the Paris Agreement.
 
Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, such requirements could require us to obtain permits for our GHG emissions, install costly emission controls, pay fees on the emissions data, and adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources as a means of addressing climate change could reduce demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas. In addition, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.

Water Discharges and Fluid Injections
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended (the Clean Water Act), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters and waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities, including oil and natural gas production facilities. The Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by permit. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as require remedial or mitigation measures, for noncompliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
 
In 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States (WOTUS) pursuant to the Clean Water Act, but several legal challenges to this rule followed, and the WOTUS rule was stayed nationwide in October 2015 pending resolution of the court challenges. The EPA and the Corps proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the WOTUS rule, and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWAs jurisdiction. In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the WOTUS rule resides with the federal district courts; consequently, the previously filed district court cases have been allowed to proceed, resulting in a patchwork of implementation in some states and stays in other. Following the Supreme Courts decision, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the WOTUS rule for two years while the agencies reconsider the rule, but federal judges barred the agencies suspension of the rule in August and November 2018.  In December 2018, EPA and the Corps issued a new proposed rule that would narrow federal jurisdictional reach compared to the existing WOTUS rule; environmental groups and certain states have challenged the new rule. As a result, future implementation of the WOTUS rule or any new rule is uncertain at this time. To the extent this rule or a revised rule expands the scope of the CWAs jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas in connection with any expansion activities.
 
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (OPA), amends the Clean Water Act and sets minimum standards for prevention, containment and cleanup of oil spills. The OPA applies to vessels, offshore facilities, and onshore facilities, including exploration and production facilities that may affect waters of the United States. Under OPA, responsible parties, including owners and operators of onshore facilities, may be held strictly liable for oil cleanup costs and natural resource damages as well as a variety of public and private damages that may result from oil spills. The OPA also requires owners or operators of certain onshore facilities to prepare Facility Response Plans for responding to a worst-case discharge of oil into waters of the United States.
 
Fluids resulting from oil and natural gas production, consisting primarily of salt water, are disposed by injection in belowground disposal wells. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program established under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for the construction and operation of disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and may restrict the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While we believe that our disposal well operations substantially comply with requirements under the applicable UIC programs, a change in disposal well regulations or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations or reduce the amount of oil and/or natural gas that we can produce from our wells.
 
There continues to be a concern that the injection of saltwater into belowground disposal wells contributes to seismic activity in certain areas, including Oklahoma, where we operate. For instance, on April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geologic Survey (OGS) issued a document entitled Statement of Oklahoma Seismicity, in which the agency states the OGS considers it very likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states, including Oklahoma, are pursuing initiatives designed to impose additional requirements in the permitting and operation of saltwater disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) has adopted rules for operators of saltwater disposal wells in certain seismically-active areas (Areas of Interest) in the Arbuckle formation, requiring operators to monitor and record well pressure and discharge volume on a daily basis and further requiring operators of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 barrels per day or more of saltwater to conduct mechanical integrity testing. Since 2015, the Oil and Gas Conservation Division (OGCD) has issued several directives expanding the Areas of Interest for induced seismicity and requiring operators to reduce the depth of, or plug back, certain wells or stop or reduce disposal volumes in certain areas, which directives have affected disposal wells that we operate. The OGCD established caps for additional wells in the Arbuckle formation, including 10 that we operate, on February 24, 2017. On March 1, 2017, the OGCD also issued a statement saying that further actions could be expected. The OGCD has since issued several directives for disposal well shut-in and volume reductions in certain areas following seismic activity. While our current plans are for future disposal wells to inject into formations other than the Arbuckle formation and we currently operate 11 such non-Arbuckle formation disposal wells, we continue to utilize wells that dispose into the Arbuckle formation. We have timely
 
17




met and satisfied all requests of the OCC regarding changes and/or reductions in disposal capacity in our operated disposal wells, all while maintaining our production base without any negative material impact thereto. We believe we are currently in compliance with the OGCDs latest requests regarding Arbuckle formation injection limits; however, a change in disposal well regulations or injection limits, or the inability to obtain permits for new disposal wells in the future may affect our ability to dispose of salt water and ultimately increase the cost of our operations and/or reduce the volume of oil and natural gas that we produce from our wells.
 
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
 
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common industry practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and/or chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel fuel in fracturing operations; issued final CAA regulations governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing; issued in June 2016 final effluent limit guidelines that saltwater from shale resource extraction operations must meet before discharging to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants; and issued in May 2014 a prepublication of its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the BLM published a final rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands in March of 2015. However, in December 2017, BLM issued a final rule repealing its 2015 rule, which rescission has been challenged by several environmental groups and states in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Compliance with such requirements could increase our costs of development and production, which costs may be significant.
 
In addition, Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states, including Oklahoma, where we operate, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Some states have elected to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, but not the states in which we own and operate oil and gas wells. Local governments may also seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nevertheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 
We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, we believe our general liability and excess liability insurance policies would cover third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations conducted by third parties and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and coverage limits of such policies.
 
Endangered Species
 
The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Oil and gas activities in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various species and their habitat. Seasonal restrictions could limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which could lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in February 2016 finalized a rule altering how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. The designation of critical habitat areas could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands. In addition, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the FWS is required to make a determination on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act by 2017. The FWS missed the deadline and continues to review species for listing. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures and could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.

Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (OSHA)
 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens.
