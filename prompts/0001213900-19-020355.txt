ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Nightfood Holdings, Inc. (“we”, “us” “the Company” or “Nightfood”) is a Nevada corporation organized on October 16, 2013 to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Nightfood, Inc., a New York corporation (“Nightfood”) from its sole shareholder, Sean Folkson. All of our operations are conducted by the Subsidiary. We are in the business of manufacturing, marketing and distributing snacks specially formulated and promoted for evening consumption. A large number of Americans consume nighttime snacks that are high in sugar, fat, sodium, and calories; such snacks can impair sleep and also impair health in general. Management believes that our products are unique in the food industry and that there is a substantial market for our products. Our corporate address is 520 White Plains Road – Suite 500, Tarrytown, New York 10591 and our telephone number is 888-888-6444. We maintain a web site at www.Nightfood.com, along with many additional web properties. Any information that may appear on our web site should not be deemed to be a part of this report.
 
On January 3, 2018, the Registrant formed a new wholly-owned subsidiary to capitalize on opportunities in the marijuana and cbd edibles space. MJ Munchies, Inc. (“Munchies”) was formed as a Nevada corporation with a capital structure of 10,000 shares of common stock. Since formation, Munchies has built an intellectual property portfolio that includes a registered trademark for Half-Baked in the State of California relating to marijuana edibles, a pending federal trademark application with the USPTO for Half-Baked relating to packaged snacks, the federal trademark for The Half Baked Cookie Co., HalfBaked.com, and several other related domain names.
 
Industry Overview
 
We are an early-stage company that is seeking to establish a market within the snack industry by offering a line of snack foods that are specifically formulated for evening consumption. It is estimated that American consumers spend over $50 Billion annually on snacks consumed at night, and this figure continues to grow. Moreover, industry data indicates that the most popular nighttime snack choices include products and categories that are traditionally considered high in calories, and “unhealthy” options, such as cookies, salty snacks (chips, pretzels, and popcorn), ice cream, and candy.

Our Products, Present and Proposed
 
Nightfood Holdings runs two distinct operating companies, each serving a different market segment with different products.
 
MJ Munchies, Inc.
 
MJ Munchies, Inc. is a Nevada corporation formed in January of 2018 to exploit legally compliant opportunities in the CBD and marijuana edibles and related spaces. The Company intends to market some of these new products under the brand name “Half-Baked”. This subsidiary was created during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and its operations have a nominal impact on the financial statements contained herein.
 
Since inception, MJ Munchies has applied for U.S. Trademark protection for its brand of Half-Baked snacks, currently under development. MJ Munchies also acquired HalfBaked.com. In April, 2018, MJ Munchies entered into an initial brand licensing agreement for the Half-Baked mark with a licensed manufacturer of THC-infused edibles in the State of California under which, the licensee manufactured and distributed a small pilot run of Half-Baked branded THC-infused cookies in California. Management continues to seek a suitable licensing partner for the intellectual property the Company has secured.
 
The Company believes tremendous opportunities currently exist to launch successful and legally compliant products in this space, and that such opportunities will continue to grow over time. No assurance can be given that the patent will be granted, that it will afford meaningful protection to us if granted, or that we will begin actual production of products using the Half-Baked trademark. Even if production begins, we can neither assure market acceptance of our products nor that THC infused edibles will not face ongoing legal challenges.
 
Nightfood, Inc.
 
Nightfood, Inc. is a snack company focused on manufacturing and distribution of ice cream that is formulated to be more appropriate for nighttime consumption. Nightfood’s initial line of products, Nightfood nutrition bars, are currently being phased out with the focus shifting to the national ice cream rollout.
 
Nightfood ice cream has been manufactured in eight flavors to date. These are Full Moon Vanilla, Midnight Chocolate, Cold Brew Decaf, After Dinner Mint Chip, Milk & Cookie Dough, Cherry Eclipse, Bed and Breakfast, and Cookies n’ Dreams. Additional flavors have been developed, both dairy, and non-dairy, for introduction in 2020 based on retailer demand. In addition, the Company has partnered with celebrities to manufacture and distribute custom flavors. The celebrity partners are Michael Clifford, guitarist of the award-winning, multi-platinum band 5 Seconds of Summer, and Richard Sherman, NFL star who plays for the San Francisco 49ers. These celebrity flavors are in various stages of development at the time of this filing, and Management anticipates both to be on shelf in spring of 2020.
 
Management believes consumer demand exists for better nighttime snacking options, and that a new consumer category consisting of nighttime specific snacks will emerge in the coming years. This belief is supported by research from major consumer goods research firms such as IRI Worldwide, and Mintel, who identified nighttime specific foods and beverages as one of the “most compelling and category changing trends” for 2017 and beyond.
 
It is estimated that over $50 billion is spent annually in the United States on snacks that are consumed between dinner and bed. Company management believes that a significant percentage of that consumer spend will move from conventional snacks to nighttime specific snacks in coming years.
 
Nightfood has established a Scientific Advisory Board consisting of sleep and nutrition experts to drive product formulation decisions, and provide consumer confidence in the brand promise. The first member of this advisory board was Dr. Michael Grandner, Director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona. Dr. Grandner has been conducting research on the link between nutrition and sleep for over ten years, and he believes improved nighttime nutritional choices can improve sleep, resulting in many short and long-term health benefits. In March of 2018, the Company added Dr. Michael Breus to their Scientific Advisory Board. Breus, known to millions as The Sleep Doctor™, is believed to be the Nation’s most trusted authority on sleep. He regularly appears in the national media to educate and inform consumers so they can sleep better and lead happier, healthier, more productive lives. In July, 2018, we completed our Scientific Advisory Board with the addition of Lauren Broch, Ph.D, M.S. Dr. Broch is a sleep therapist and former Director of Eductation & Training at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Weill Cornell Medical College. Uniquely, Dr. Broch also has a master’s degree in human nutrition. This unique combination allowed her to play an important role in the reformulation of our nutrition bars, and the development of Nightfood ice cream. These experts work with Company management to ensure Nightfood products deliver on their nighttime-appropriate, and sleep-friendly promises.

Production
 
To date, we have utilized contract manufacturers for producing our products, packaging for our products, and 3rd party logistics for warehousing and order fulfillment. Our current ice cream co-packer has capacity to manufacture approximately 400,000 pints of ice cream monthly. Management has had initial conversations with other manufacturing facilities to establish additional production capacity as it becomes necessary.
Marketing and Distribution
 
Nightfood ice cream is currently available in 4 major supermarket chains. These are Meijer, Woodman’s, Lowes Foods, and Harris Teeter. The product line has garnered extensive media interest from outlets such as Oprah Magazine, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and more. Consumers seem very enthusiastic about the prospect of a sleep-friendly ice cream. Management is working with these retail partners on various marketing and promotional campaigns to drive trial and repeat purchase at the store level.
Competition
 
The nutritional/snack food business is highly competitive and includes such participants as large companies like Mondelez, Nestle S.A. and Quaker Oats and more specialized companies such as Cliff Bar, Quest Nutrition and many smaller companies. Many of these competitors have well established names and products. Nestle recently announced an interest in the nighttime snacking space with the introduction of a candy-type product called GoodNight. We will initially compete based upon the unique nature of our product. However, other companies, including those with greater name recognition than us and greater resources may seek to introduce products that directly compete with our products. Management believes that if a competitor sought to develop a competing product, it could do so and begin to establish retail distribution in 12-24 months. Based on the current acquisition climate in the consumer goods space, Management believes that successful growth of the Nightfood ice cream line would likely bring acquisition offers from potential competitors before it would actually bring competition on the shelf from those same potential competitors.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We own the registered trademark “Nightfood®” for the nutrition bar/snack/meal replacement category, and have applied for registration for the same mark for ice cream. While this process will take several months, management believes the mark will be granted in due time with no concerns or issues. We believe these marks will prove important to our business. Additionally, we own the domain Nightfood.com as well as many other relevant domains such as late-night-snack.com, nighttimesnack.com, and nighttimesnacking.com, as well as Nightfood.us, Nightfood.net, TryNightfood.com, GetNightfood.com, NiteFood.com, TryNightfood.com, BuyNightfood.com, NightSnacking.com, and Night-Food.com. We also own the toll-free number 888-888-NIGHT. We rely on proprietary information as to our formulas and have non-disclosure agreements with our suppliers.

Personnel
 
Nightfood currently has no employees except Sean Folkson, our President and CEO. Through vendor and consultant relationships, Nightfood has dozens of people contributing to our operations and efforts on a regular basis. Should we be successful in executing our business plan, we anticipate hiring additional employees in the future to assist with various company functions. However, we also expect to continue to strategically outsource significantly to accomplish work that might otherwise be done by employees in a more traditional company.
Customers
 
In FY 2019, sales were concentrated among a handful of customers that each accounted for over 10% of our revenue. We expect this type of revenue concentration to continue as our business model involves selling large quantities of ice cream wholesale to large accounts (major supermarket chains, national distribution organizations), who then sell to the consumer. With more widespread distribution, the concentration would decrease to some extent.
DEVELOPMENT PLANS
 
Nightfood has eight ice cream flavors already in ongoing production, and an additional ten products have been developed or in late stages of development. These include two custom celebrity flavors, four new ice cream flavors, and four non-dairy flavors. Management has done preliminary research on CBD infused ice cream, current FDA guidelines do not permit CBD to be used as an additive in food, and Management does not believe such products will be allowed under FDA guidelines for several quarters.
