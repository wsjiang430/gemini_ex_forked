ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

 
Sono-Tek Corporation (the “Company”, “Sono-Tek”, “We” or “Our”) is the world leader in the design and manufacture of ultrasonic coating systems for applying precise, thin film coatings to protect, strengthen, smooth or enable surfaces on parts and components for the microelectronics/electronics, alternative energy, medical, industrial and emerging research & development/other markets. We design and manufacture custom-engineered ultrasonic coating systems and also provide patented nozzles and generators for manufacturers’ equipment.
 Our ultrasonic nozzle systems use high frequency ultrasonic vibrations that atomize liquids into minute drops that can be applied to surfaces at low velocity providing microscopic layers of protective materials over a wide variety of surfaces, including glass and metals. Our solutions are environmentally-friendly, efficient and highly reliable. They enable dramatic reductions in overspray, savings in raw material, water and energy usage and provide improved process repeatability, transfer efficiency, high uniformity and reduced emissions. We serve a variety of industries and applications and have a broad base of customers. Our largest customer accounted for 14% of revenue in fiscal 2019. 
 The applications that are employing our unique coating technology and expertise have been expanding as the advantages of ultrasonic coatings are more broadly recognized. The original application of our technology was to coat the inner surface of blood collection tubes used for medical diagnostic testing. Our products enable the application of a thin and uniform coating of material that prevents coagulation of blood. Following that initial breakthrough, our technology was then used for applying uniform flux coatings to printed circuit boards, a critical part of the fabrication process for all electronic devices. A later application for much larger surfaces was to address the many challenges that glass manufacturers faced. They needed a solution for specialized glass applications in the construction and automotive industries. Among other things, our ultrasonic nozzles are used to provide coatings that improve durability, create filters, increase clarity, reduce reflection, enable conductivity, and enhance safety. We have invested significant resources to enhance our market diversity by leveraging our core ultrasonic coating technology. As a result, we have increased our portfolio of products, the industries we serve, and the countries in which we sell our products.
 
We were founded by the inventor of the ultrasonic nozzle, Dr. Harvery Berger, and incorporated in New York on March 21, 1975. We became a public company in 1987 and our stock is traded on the OTCQX U.S. tier of the OTC exchange under the ticker symbol “SOTK”. Our corporate offices are located in Milton, New York where our production facilities are co-located. We also have a sales and service office in Singapore and an application process development laboratory in Guangzhou, China. We are ISO 9001 qualified since registering in September 1998 and have been recertified annually since then.
 
Our fiscal year ends on February 28. We refer to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 as “fiscal 2019” and use similar protocol for previous fiscal years.

Research and Development
 
We believe that our long-term growth is dependent upon the development and commercialization of ultrasonic coating technologies to solve customers’ high value problems across a wide spectrum of applications in various industries, while also advancing the utility of our core technology. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we spent $1,325,000 and $1,280,000, respectively, on research and development activities related to new products and services and the ongoing improvement of existing products and services. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 11.4% and 11.6% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
Our business is based in part on the technology covered by our U.S. patents. We also rely on unpatented know-how in the design and production of our nozzle systems, subsystems and complete solutions. We have executed non-disclosure and non-compete agreements with all of our employees to safeguard our intellectual property. We execute reciprocal non-disclosure agreements with our key customers to safeguard any jointly developed intellectual property.
Competition
 
We operate in competitive markets in many of our industry segments. We compete against alternative coating technologies, as well as global and regional manufacturers of nozzles and other products based on price, quality, product features, application engineering and follow up service. We maintain our competitive position by providing highly effective solutions that meet our customers’ requirements and needs. In several emerging markets, we encounter less competition compared to more established markets based on the uniqueness of our ultrasonic technology in these applications.
Information Regarding Sales Outside the United States 
 
During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for approximately $7,559,000, or 65% of total revenue, and $6,193,000, or 56% of total revenue, respectively.
