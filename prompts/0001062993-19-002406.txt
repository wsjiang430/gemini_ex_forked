Our Current Business
Effective May 10, 2018, we executed and closed a purchase agreement with Grupo Jaque Ltd. and First Colombia Devco SAS (Devco) whereby we acquired the issued and outstanding share capital of Devco, a Colombian company, from its sole shareholder, Grupo Jaque Ltd. The consideration for the purchase was $100,000, which represented a reimbursement of the vendors costs to capitalize and establish the Colombian company, and the costs of establishing the companys Colombian head offices.
 Our goal with Devco was to establish business ventures in Colombias rapidly developing economy, with a focus on agriculture and real estate development, tourism, infrastructure, and other high growth sectors that may be identified as worth pursuing. Such enterprises were in the initial planning and investigation stages, with the initial endeavor of Devco being a pilot program for a cattle division which acquires, free ranges and resells cattle for the domestic Colombian beef market, to establish the commercial viability of such an approach.
 Effective June 7, 2018, we executed a property purchase agreement with Terra Viva Property Development S.A.S. whereby agreed to acquire certain real property located in the Municipality of Tarso, Antioquia, in Colombia. The property is 13.3125 hectares in size. The consideration for the purchase was $450,000. The Municipality of Tarso, approximately 50km from Medellin, is in the Suroeste region of Antioquia and is a popular resort area
 On April 26, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a strategic repositioning of the Company, as follows:
 
1. | Disposition of the Colombian assets. We are now in the process of developing a plan for such disposition, which we intend to conclude within one year. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Develop a nationwide network of medical marijuana dispensaries and related businesses in the United States, where legally permitted, with a focus on both THC-dominant and CBD-dominant cannabis manufacturing, distribution and sales. 

 In pursuit of the above, on May 14, 2019, the Company announced the following:
 
1. | A non-binding Letter of Intent with Critical Mass Industries LLC DBA Good Meds ("Good Meds") pursuant to which the Company will acquire the management assets related to dispensing, cultivation, and extraction as well as the brand assets of Good Meds, which includes BOSM Labs, in exchange for US $1,999,770 and 15,053,233 shares of common stock. Good Meds was founded in Denver, Colorado in 2009 by John Knapp. As a pioneering company in a fully regulated cannabis marketplace, Good Meds operates two retail storefronts and a 90,000-square-foot cultivation and extraction facility, producing world-class Medical and Adult Use products. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A non-biding Letter of Intent to acquire General Extract LLC DBA General Extract (General Extract). General Extract was founded in 2015 as an importer, distributor, broker and post-processor of hemp and hemp derivatives. Working in value-add areas of the supply chain, General Extract operates a hemp- derivative refinement and distribution center in Denver, Colorado. As an intermediary in the global supply of cannabis products, General Extract is closely aligned with both the upstream and downstream cannabis industry leaders. 
3. | The terms of a proposed private placement of the Companys common stock in a non-brokered transaction. Under the terms of the private placement, FCOL intends to offer up to US $7 million in shares of common stock at a purchase price of US $0.50 per share. As of this date, the Company has had preliminary discussions with proposed investors, but has not entered into any binding agreements with respect to the sale of the shares. While the Company is confident that the placement will be successful, there can be no assurance that the financing will close or that the terms will not be modified. The offering will be made exclusively to accredited investors pursuant to exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. 

 The Company expects the acquisitions and the financing will close by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2019.

We will be required to obtain those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct operations, construction and other programs. There are no current orders or directions relating to us or to our properties with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. Such compliance may include feasibility studies on the surface impact of our proposed operations, costs associated with minimizing environmental impact, water treatment and protection, reclamation activities, including rehabilitation of various sites, on-going efforts at alleviating impact on wildlife and permits or bonds as may be required to ensure our compliance with applicable regulations. It is possible that the costs and delays associated with such compliance could become so prohibitive.

While our current projects and business activities do not violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
