Item 1. Business
Overview
 Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc. (“Cyclerion”, the “Company” or “we”) is a biopharmaceutical company on a mission to develop treatments for serious diseases.
 Cyclerion's portfolio includes novel soluble guanylate cyclase ("sGC") stimulators that modulate a key node in a fundamental signaling network in both the central nervous system ("CNS") and the periphery. The nitric oxide ("NO") soluble guanylate cyclase ("sGC") cyclic guanosine monophosphate ("cGMP") signaling pathway is a fundamental mechanism that precisely controls key aspects of physiology throughout the body. The NO-sGC-cGMP pathway regulates diverse and critical biological functions including mitochondrial function, neuronal function, inflammation, and hemodynamics. Although this pathway has been successfully targeted with several drugs in the periphery, this mechanism has yet to be fully leveraged therapeutically, particularly in the CNS, where impaired NO-sGC-cGMP signaling is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.
Zagociguat (previously CY6463) is a clinical-stage CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator that has shown rapid improvement in cerebral blood flow, functional brain connectivity, brain response to visual stimulus, cognitive performance, and biomarkers associated mitochondrial function and inflammation in clinical studies. CY 3018 is a CNS-targeted sGC stimulator that preferentially localizes to the brain and has a pharmacology profile that suggests its potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders. Praliciguat is a systemic sGC stimulator that is licensed to Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. ("Akebia") and being advanced in rare kidney disease. Olinciguat is a clinical-stage vascular sGC stimulator that the Company intends to out-license for cardiovascular diseases. Cyclerion is actively evaluating the best combination of capital, capabilities, and transactions available to it to advance the development of zagociguat and its other clinical development candidates and to maximize shareholder value.
The following table presents the status of our portfolio of sGC stimulators:
 
Cyclerion became an independent public company on April 1, 2019 after Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ironwood, completed a tax-free spin-off of its sGC business, which we refer to herein as the "Separation". We are

led by an accomplished team, with a track record of discovering, developing, and commercializing meaningful therapies for patients while creating value for stockholders and with expertise and deep experience in the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway.
Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Research and Development programs
 Zagociguat is an orally administered CNS-penetrant sGC stimulator. NO-sGC-cGMP is a fundamental signaling network, including in the brain where it is critical to basic CNS functions. Deficient NO-sGC-cGMP signaling is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of many peripheral and CNS disorders. As an sGC stimulator, zagociguat amplifies endogenous NO signaling by acting as a positive allosteric modulator to sensitize the sGC enzyme to NO and increase the production of cGMP. By compensating for deficient NO-sGC-cGMP signaling, zagociguat may have broad therapeutic potential as a treatment for people with serious diseases.
On January 13, 2020, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 first-in-human study that provided the first clinical data supporting the development of zagociguat. The results from this study indicate that zagociguat was well tolerated. Pharmacokinetic data, obtained from both blood and cerebral spinal fluid, support once-daily dosing with or without food and demonstrated zagociguat penetration of the blood-brain-barrier with concentrations in the CSF expected to be pharmacologically active.
On October 14, 2020, we announced positive topline results from our zagociguat Phase 1 translational pharmacology study in healthy elderly participants. Treatment with zagociguat for 15 days in this 24-subject study confirmed and extended results seen in the earlier first-in-human Phase 1 study: once-daily oral treatment demonstrated blood-brain-barrier penetration with expected CNS exposure and target engagement. Results also showed significant improvements in neurophysiological and objective performance measures as well as decreases in inflammatory biomarkers associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Zagociguat was safe and generally well tolerated in the study. These results, together with nonclinical data, supported the continued development of zagociguat as a potential new medicine for serious diseases involving the CNS.
On June 10, 2022, we announced positive topline clinical data for zagociguat in our signal-seeking clinical study for the potential treatment of Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes ("MELAS"). In this open-label, single-arm study of the oral, once-daily sGC stimulator in eight adults aged 18 or older with MELAS, improvements were seen across a range of endpoints reflecting multiple domains of disease activity, including mitochondrial disease-associated biomarkers such as lactate and GDF-15, a broad panel of inflammatory biomarkers, cerebral blood flow, and functional connectivity between neural networks. These positive effects after 29 days of dosing were supported by correlations among several endpoints with each other and with zagociguat plasma concentrations. Zagociguat was well tolerated with no serious or severe adverse events and no events leading to discontinuation. Pharmacokinetics were consistent with the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. The positive data from this study support the potential of zagociguat to provide therapeutic benefit to people living with mitochondrial diseases, including MELAS.
  On July 28, 2022, we announced positive topline data from our signal-seeking clinical study of zagociguat for the potential treatment of Cognitive Impairment Associated with Schizophrenia ("CIAS"). Data from the 14-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose study in 48 adults aged 18-50 with stable schizophrenia on a stable, single, atypical antipsychotic regimen demonstrated that once-daily zagociguat was safe and well tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse events, severe adverse events, or treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. We further announced that study data demonstrated a strong effect on cognitive performance after two weeks of 15mg once-daily dosing and that positive movement on inflammatory biomarkers was also observed. These signals on exploratory endpoints are consistent with pro-cognitive and anti-inflammatory effects of zagociguat observed in preclinical studies and prior clinical trials and support the further development of oral, once-daily zagociguat.

In October 2022, the WHO International Nonproprietary Names committee and the United States Adopted Name council selected zagociguat as a nonproprietary name for CY6463.
 On October 6, 2022, we announced that we had recently capped enrollment in our signal-seeking clinical study of zagociguat for the potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease with vascular pathology ("ADv"). Data from the ADv study are expected in the first half of 2023. The ADv study is supported in part by a $2 million grant from the Alzheimer’s Association’s Part the Cloud-Gates Partnership Grant Program (the "PTC Grant").
 On March 22, 2023, we announced that given the significant capital and capabilities necessary to ensure that the MELAS Phase 2b study is executed efficiently and with the highest quality, and the currently unfavorable capital market conditions, we are actively evaluating the best combination of capital, capabilities, and transactions available to us to advance the development of zagociguat and our other clinical development candidates and to maximize shareholder value.
CY3018 is a CNS-targeted sGC stimulator in preclinical development that preferentially localizes to the brain and has a pharmacology profile that suggests its potential for the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders.
 Praliciguat is an orally administered, once-daily systemic sGC stimulator. On June 3, 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Akebia relating to the exclusive worldwide license to Akebia of our rights to the development, manufacture, medical affairs, and commercialization of pharmaceutical products containing praliciguat and other related products and forms thereof enumerated in such agreement. Cyclerion is eligible to receive up to $585 million in total potential future development, regulatory, and commercialization milestone payments. Cyclerion is also eligible to receive tiered, sales-based royalties ranging from single-digit to high-teen percentages.
 Olinciguat is an orally administered, once-daily, vascular sGC stimulator that was evaluated in a Phase 2 study of participants with sickle cell disease. We released topline results from this study in October 2020. We intend to out-license olinciguat to an entity with strong cardiovascular and/or cardiopulmonary capabilities.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to develop treatments for serious diseases. The first step is identifying indications for clinical development where the scientific rationale is strong and the unmet need is high, creating a compelling opportunity. We have several product opportunities including zagociguat for mitochondrial diseases, CY3018 for neuropsychiatric diseases, and olinciguat for cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary diseases. Our focus right now is to find the best combination of capital, capabilities, and transactions that will enable the advancement of these assets for patients in a way that maximizes shareholder value.
Intellectual Property
 We vigorously protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including by pursuing and maintaining U.S. and foreign patents that cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and the processes for their preparation, as well as any other relevant inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions, improvements and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 We have twenty-six issued U.S. patents, twenty-eight pending U.S. patents applications (of which six are in the provisional stage), four pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application, and numerous foreign patents

and pending patent applications. The PCT applications are filed under an international patent law treaty that provides a unified procedure for filing a single initial patent application to seek patent protection for an invention simultaneously in each of the 153 contracting states, followed by the process of entering national phase, which requires a separate application in each of the member states in which national patent protection is sought.
 The technology underlying our sGC patents and pending patent applications has been developed by us and was not acquired from any in-licensing agreement. We own all of the issued patents and pending applications.
 The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced product candidates are summarized below.

Additional Intellectual Property
 In addition to the patents and patent applications related to zagociguat, CY3018, praliciguat, and olinciguat, we currently have seven issued U.S. patents; eight patents granted in foreign jurisdictions, including European patents that have each been validated in several countries; and a number of pending U.S. (including provisional applications) and foreign pending patent applications directed to other sGC stimulator molecules and uses thereof.
Patent Term
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application, assuming that all applicable maintenance or annuity fees are paid. In the United States, a patent's term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in that country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 In addition, the term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. For a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug (drug substance or drug product), an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have similar patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency.
 Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-how, by establishing confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities' relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. We also take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual

property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Government Regulation
 United States Regulation
 The FDA regulates medical products, including prescription drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, debarment, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA, the Department of Justice, State Attorneys General, or other governmental entities.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be approved and marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory and animal studies conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence;
 •approval by an independent IRB to proceed with initiating the clinical trial at each corresponding investigational site.
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCPs and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication;
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections such as pre-approval inspection(s) of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are made to assess compliance with current GMP;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
 •FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which may include an Advisory Committee review.
 The development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain.
 Nonclinical and Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 Before testing any drug product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing. Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The conduct of nonclinical studies that determine the product safety information for administration to humans must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical study protocol, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in

a given indication may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the content of the IND or the conduct of the proposed trial(s) as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such a case, the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial(s) can proceed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for the sites at which the trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The IRB also approves the informed consent form, including a privacy statement, that must be provided to each clinical trial participant or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy participants or disease-affected participants who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
 •Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited population of participants with a disease or disorder to evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
 •Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of participants at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, to establish the overall benefit/risk profile of the product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval by the FDA.
 •Phase 4. Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required to be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of participants in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA. Failure to conduct the Phase 4 clinical trials per the plan required by the FDA could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval.
 Progress reports detailing new information and changes such as the results of clinical trials, new nonclinical studies, new product quality data, or changes to manufacturing controls must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time, or the FDA may impose other sanctions on various grounds, including a finding that the research participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the IRB or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to participants. There are also requirements related to registration and reporting of certain clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Submission and Review of an NDA
 Assuming successful completion of the required nonclinical and clinical testing, the results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the product's manufacture, composition, quality controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases (e.g., for products that have received an Orphan Designation).


The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and may require additional nonclinical or clinical studies, or other information (e.g., product quality data or manufacturing controls) before it accepts the filing. If an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original NDAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its review of a standard application, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information and clinical data or clarification.
 The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with current GMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with current GMP. Additionally, the FDA will frequently inspect one or more clinical trial sites for compliance with GCPs and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
 During the approval process, the FDA will also prepare an integrated benefit-risk assessment and determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks and to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS. A REMS that includes elements to assure safe use, or ETASU, can substantially increase the costs of commercializing a drug. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. Boxed warnings may limit the type of advertising for a drug. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data.
 On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, FDA will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug and is accompanied by specific prescribing information for specific conditions of use. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either amend the NDA with data to address the raised concerns, resubmit the NDA addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, engage in dispute resolution with the FDA about the identified deficiencies in the CRL, or withdraw the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the re-submitted application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or in other limited cases. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, though companies developing orphan drugs may be eligible for certain incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing.
 Generally, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different active moieties for the same indication or obtain approval for the same active moiety for a different indication. If one of our product candidates designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.


Expedited Review and Approval
 The FDA has various programs that are intended to expedite development and approval of drugs intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
 An application may be eligible for a "fast track" designation for a product that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team and permits FDA to consider sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.
In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor.
 An application may be eligible for "accelerated approval" where the product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments; applications eligible for accelerated approval may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA requires a sponsor to conduct confirmatory studies to verify the predicted effect on IMM or another clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures.
 Once an NDA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if the FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Under priority review, the FDA must review an application in six months, compared to ten months for a standard review. A product may be eligible for more than one expedited approval program. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, however, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, these expedited review pathways do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 Non-Patent Exclusivity
 In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for approval of a generic or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the listed drug as protected by regulatory exclusivity.
 An NDA for a new chemical entity may receive five years of exclusivity, whereby the FDA will not accept for filing, with limited exceptions, a product seeking to rely upon the FDA's findings of safety or effectiveness for such new chemical entity. An ANDA containing a paragraph IV patent certification can be filed after four years. Alternatively, an NDA may obtain a three-year period of non-patent market exclusivity for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant.
 Pediatric Exclusivity
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing

regulatory exclusivity for both drugs and biologics, and also unexpired Orange Book listed patents in the case of drugs. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if a sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for marketed products and the establishments where such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for certain supplemental applications. The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA, such as Phase 4 clinical trials or a REMS.
 In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and such state agencies for compliance with current GMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from current GMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain current GMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown safety issues with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters of clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications, in accordance with the provisions of the approved label and FDA guidance. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Additionally, all promotional material must be truthful and non-misleading, and present balanced information regarding the risks and benefits of the drug product.


Other Regulatory Requirements
Outside the U.S., our abilities to develop and market a product are contingent upon receiving approval and ultimately marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the E.U. registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one E.U. member state.
We are subject to U.S. federal and foreign anti-corruption laws. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing, or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA encompasses certain healthcare professionals in many countries. We are also subject to similar laws of other countries that have enacted anti-corruption laws and regulations.
Pediatric Development
 In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Where the MAA includes the results of all pediatric studies conducted in accordance with the PIP and the results are reflected in the approved summary of product characteristics, the holder of a patent or supplementary protection certificate is entitled to receive a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, the product is eligible for a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 In the US, under Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a pediatric development plan is required to accompany an NDA for all drugs, except those receiving non-oncology Orphan Drug Designation. This may include waiver or deferral of pediatric studies. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) also allows for agreement with FDA on a pediatric written request that, if fulfilled, may extend data exclusivity for the molecule for an additional 6 months.
 Competition
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive within and across therapeutic categories and indications. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, government agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies competing with our product candidates is likely to increase. However, we seek to build our portfolio with key differentiating attributes to provide a competitive advantage in the markets we target. The success of all of our product candidates, if approved, will likely depend upon their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 Many of our competitors, including those mentioned below, may have greater financial resources and broader expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with Cyclerion in establishing clinical trial sites and participant registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.


Competition can be viewed as through at least two lenses: 1) companies that are developing products with a different mechanism of action to address the same therapeutic need and 2) companies that are developing products that act through the same mechanism of action (i.e., sGC modulators).
Competition within target therapeutic areas.
 We believe Biogen, Sage, Otsuka, Neumora, Tonix, Neurocrine, Pfizer, atai Life Sciences, Alto Neuroscience, Cerevel, Karuna, PTC Therapeutics, Khondrion B.V, Abliva AB, Reneo, Travere Therapeutics, Dimerix Limited, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Chinook Therapeutics, Boehringer Ingelheim, Acelyrin, River 3 Renal Corp, Astellas, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Bayer and Merck are our most direct competitors with respect to zagociguat, CY3018, praliciguat, and olinciguat.
Competition within the sGC mechanism.
 There is one major competitor that is actively developing sGC modulators. Bayer and Merck have an active collaboration on sGC stimulators, focused primarily on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal indications. They have two approved sGC stimulators, ADEMPAS® (riociguat), indicated for PAH and CTEPH, and VERQUVO® (vericiguat) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We are not aware of any efforts to develop sGC modulators for treatment of CNS diseases.
Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our ongoing clinical trials and our nonclinical research. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for the supply of zagociguat and CY3018 for all stages of clinical development and commercialization, as well as for the supply of any other product candidates that we may identify. We require all our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current GMP requirements.
 We believe that zagociguat and CY3018 drug substance and drug product may be manufactured from readily available raw materials and the processes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling. We believe adequate supply of zagociguat and CY3018 drug substance and drug product is readily available from our current CMOs to satisfy our immediate clinical and nonclinical demands. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a purchase order basis and do not have arrangements in place for long-term supply or redundant supply of zagociguat and CY3018; however, we are working with our CMOs to implement improvements to our drug substance and drug product manufacturing processes to further ensure product capacity adequate to meet further development demands. We are evaluating CMOs for drug substance and drug product that could meet potential commercial demands.
 Human Capital Resources
 We have an exceptional and diverse team of individuals who have a passion for developing important new medicines that will have a profound impact on the lives of patients with serious CNS diseases. As a small, innovative company, our success depends on attracting, retaining and motivating highly skilled and experienced scientific, medical and other personnel. Our ability to recruit and retain such employees depends on a number of factors, including our distinct corporate culture, and our collaborative work environment. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs which include competitive salaries, potential annual discretionary bonuses, stock awards, a 401(k) plan with employer match, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, unlimited vacation time, among other benefits. Our employees are further guided by our code of conduct and our cultural values of seeking to serve patients, acting with integrity, empowering people and innovating for solutions.
 We are committed to our employees’ health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of our

employees and the communities in which we live and work, while continuing to ensure the safety of patients in our trials.
