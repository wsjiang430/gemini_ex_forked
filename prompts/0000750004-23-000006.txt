ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise indicates, all references to the words “Light & Wonder,” “Light & Wonder, Inc.,” “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to L&W and its consolidated subsidiaries.
General
L&W, formerly known as Scientific Games, was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 2, 1984. On September 18, 2017, L&W entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with SG Nevada Merger Company, a Nevada corporation and L&W’s wholly owned subsidiary (“Newco”), providing for the merger of L&W with and into Newco with Newco surviving the merger (the “Surviving Corporation”), for the sole purpose of changing L&W’s state of incorporation from Delaware to Nevada (the “reincorporation merger”). The reincorporation merger was approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of outstanding shares of Class A common stock of L&W entitled to vote thereon at a special meeting of L&W’s stockholders on November 27, 2017. On January 10, 2018, the reincorporation merger was consummated. Following the consummation of the reincorporation merger, each outstanding share of Class A common stock of L&W, par value $0.01 per share, automatically converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, par value $0.001 per share. The reincorporation merger did not result in any change in L&W’s name, headquarters, business, management, location of offices, assets, liabilities or net worth, other than as a result of the costs incident to the reincorporation merger. Our management, including all directors and officers, immediately prior to the reincorporation merger remained the same immediately following the reincorporation merger and assumed identical positions with the Surviving Corporation.
During the second quarter of 2021, with the support of our Board of Directors, we completed our strategic review and set forth our strategy to become a leading cross-platform global games company with a focus on content and digital markets. As a result of this strategy, during 2022 we completed divestitures of the Lottery Business and Sports Betting Business, which marked a major milestone in transforming and deleveraging our balance sheet. 
On April 18, 2022, we changed our name to “Light & Wonder, Inc.” In connection therewith, the ticker symbol for the Company’s common stock was changed from SGMS to LNW, at the time of the legal name change. The Company’s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market.
We are a leading cross-platform global games company with a focus on content and digital markets. Our portfolio of revenue-generating activities in our continuing operations primarily includes supplying game content and gaming machines, CMSs and table game products and services to licensed gaming entities; providing social casino and other mobile games, including casual gaming, to retail customers; and providing a comprehensive suite of digital gaming content, distribution platforms, player account management systems, as well as various other iGaming content and services. We report our results of operations in three business segments—Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming—representing our different products and services. 
We have reflected the financial results of the Lottery Business and Sports Betting Business as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures included herein relate to our continuing operations.
Strategy
We strive to provide high quality products and services to our customers across all of our business segments. We reconstituted our Board of Directors in 2020, and during the second quarter of 2021, with the support of our Board of Directors, we completed our strategic review and set forth our strategy to become a leading cross-platform global games company with a focus on content and digital markets. We established a strategic roadmap to drive long-term value that consists of: (i) growing our market share and leveraging our differentiated position; (ii) streamlining our organization; (iii) driving sustainable growth and maintaining a healthy balance sheet; and (iv) disciplined capital allocation strategy. In 2022, we completed the Divestitures, reaching a major milestone in transforming our business, and with our resulting streamlined organization and vision to be the leading cross-platform global games company, we continue to focus on the following, supporting our strategic roadmap:
•Creating great content and franchises fully cross-platform and enabling a seamless player experience — We are singularly focused on creating great games and evergreen franchises that can be made available to players on any platform they want to play and enabling systems and technology for our players and customers. 
•Expanding in high-return markets — We are investing organically and inorganically in our core markets and strategic adjacencies that generate strong long-term cash-based returns.
•Maximizing cash flow from operations — With the completion of the Divestitures, we have significantly de-levered our balance sheet, enabling us to invest organically and inorganically in our core growth areas to accelerate our strategies by investing and unlocking shareholder value.
•Disciplined capital allocation — We are focused on returning capital to shareholders through our balanced and opportunistic capital allocation management, including, but not limited to, organic investments in R&D and capital expenditures, expanding in high-return markets, and share repurchases, while we maintain financial strength and flexibility.
•High performing talent and culture — We are creating an organization and culture of high performance by building a strong and diverse global team that cultivates open minds and focuses on driving innovation and enabling an efficient and flexible operation that is structured to support our business strategies.
Gaming Segment
The gaming industry is characterized by the continuous development of new technologies, products and game content. Gaming products and services are used by a diverse group of gaming operators and U.S. and international lotteries which may offer VLTs and other forms of gaming, such as bingo and sports wagering.
Our products are installed in all of the major regulated U.S. gaming jurisdictions and in approximately 185 international gaming jurisdictions. Growth of gaming in land-based venues is driven by the opening of new casinos in both new and existing jurisdictions and the expansion of existing casinos. In addition, the land-based gaming business is significantly impacted by the rate at which casinos and other gaming operators replace their gaming machines, which depends on a number of factors, including their capital budgets. Virtually all sectors of the gaming industry are impacted by changes in economic conditions that impact players’ disposable incomes.
A substantial portion of our U.K. gaming business benefits from a contract with the large U.K. bookmaker Entain PLC, which represents a significant portion of our U.K. LBO server-based gaming business.
Competition
The gaming machine sector is highly competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new games, gaming machines and related technologies. We compete primarily with Ainsworth Game Technology, Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., (“Aristocrat”), Aruze Gaming America, Inc., Bluberi Gaming USA, Inc., Everi Games, Inc., Incredible Technologies, Inc., International Game Technology (“IGT”) (a subsidiary of International Game Technology PLC), Inspired Entertainment Inc., Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. (“Konami”), the Novomatic Group of Companies, Interblock, and PlayAGS, Inc. (“AGS”).
The CMS business is also highly competitive. Product features and functionality, accuracy, reliability, service level and pricing are among the factors that determine how successful systems providers are in selling their systems. Our principal competitors in CMSs include Aristocrat, IGT and Konami. Competition for these products is intense due to the number of providers and the limited number of casinos and jurisdictions in which they operate.
With respect to our table products, we compete on the basis of the breadth of our Shuffler products and services and PTGs, product reliability, service, the strength of our intellectual property and our extensive sales, regulatory and distribution channels. 
Our automated Shufflers also compete against hand shuffling, which remains the most competitive shuffling option for casino card games around the world. Finally, since the need for our Shuffler products depends upon a casino’s use of live table games, our Shufflers also compete against any products that live table games compete against.
Competition for PTG content is based on player appeal, brand recognition, price and the strength of the underlying intellectual property. We compete on this basis and on the strength of our extensive sales, service, marketing and distribution channels. We also compete with non-PTGs such as blackjack and baccarat and several companies that primarily develop and license PTGs such as AGS, Galaxy Gaming, Inc. and Masque Publishing, Inc. Finally, some of our product lines may compete against one another for space on the casino floor.
SciPlay Segment
Our SciPlay business segment is a leading developer and publisher of digital games on mobile and web platforms. SciPlay operates primarily in the social gaming market, which is characterized by gameplay online or on mobile devices that is social, competitive and self-directed in pace and session length. SciPlay also operates in the hyper-casual market, which is characterized by simpler core loops and more repetitive gameplay than casual games. SciPlay generates a substantial portion of its revenue from in-app purchases in the form of virtual coins, chips and cards, which players can use to play slot games, table games or bingo games. Players who install SciPlay’s games typically receive free coins, chips or cards upon the initial launch of the game and additional free coins, chips or cards at specific time intervals. Players may exhaust the coins, chips or cards that they receive for free and may choose to purchase additional coins, chips or cards in order to extend their time of game play. Once obtained, coins, chips and cards (either free or purchased) cannot be redeemed for cash nor exchanged for anything other 
than game play within SciPlay’s apps. SciPlay generates additional revenue in the hyper-casual market from the receipt of advertising revenue. Players who install SciPlay’s hyper-casual games receive free, unlimited gameplay that requires viewing of periodic in-game advertisements.
SciPlay currently offers a variety of social casino games, including JACKPOT PARTY® Casino, GOLD FISH® Casino, QUICK HIT® Slots, 88 FORTUNES® Slots, MONOPOLY Slots and HOT SHOT CASINO®. Our SciPlay business segment continues to pursue its strategy of expanding into the casual games market. Current casual game titles include BINGO SHOWDOWN®, SOLITAIRE PETS™ Adventure and Backgammon Live as well as other titles in the hyper-casual market through the acquisition of Alictus Yazilim Anonim Şirketi (“Alictus”), including games such as CANDY CHALLENGE 3D™, BOSS LIFE™ and DEEP CLEAN INC. 3D™. During 2022, SciPlay launched seven hyper-casual games, including the top hits Master Doctor 3D™ and Fade Master 3D™, and continued development of SPELLSPINNER: FANTASY QUEST™, a casual game. SciPlay’s social casino games typically include slots-style game play and occasionally include table games-style game play, while its casual games blend solitaire-style or bingo game play with adventure game features, and its hyper-casual games include many simple core loop mechanics. All of SciPlay’s games are offered and played across multiple platforms, including APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AMAZON, and MICROSOFT. In addition to SciPlay’s internally created game content, SciPlay’s content library includes recognizable Light & Wonder game content. This content allows players who like playing land-based game content to enjoy some of those same titles in SciPlay’s free-to-play games. SciPlay has access to Light & Wonder’s library of more than 1,500 iconic casino titles, including titles and content from third-party licensed brands such as MONOPOLY and JAMES BOND™. SciPlay’s access to this content, coupled with its years of experience developing in-house content, uniquely positions SciPlay to create compelling digital games.
A number of trends and opportunities are driving significant changes in digital gaming, which we believe are causing growth in the casual games market and providing opportunities for SciPlay to grow our social casino games and expand into other areas of the casual games market, such as:
•Digital gaming is an engaging form of entertainment;
•Mobile devices are a leading medium to consume content such as games;
•Increasing number of players with the emergence of casual games;
•Scale is increasingly strategic in order to succeed in mobile gaming;
•Social casino gaming is an attractive market within digital gaming; and
•Additional market opportunities within the broader mobile gaming landscape.
Competition
Our SciPlay business segment faces significant competition in all aspects of its business. SciPlay’s primary social casino game competitors include Playtika, Playstudios, Product Madness/Big Fish Games (subsidiaries of Aristocrat), DoubleU Games Co., Ltd/Double Down Interactive, GSN Games/Bash Gaming (subsidiaries of Scopely, Inc.), AppLovin Corporation and Huuuge Games. SciPlay’s competitors in the broader social game market include Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Kabam, Take-Two Interactive (acquirer of Zynga, Inc.), Tencent Holdings and Rovio. SciPlay also competes with platforms that host real money gambling, including those provided by our iGaming business segment. On the broadest scale, we compete for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players versus other forms of online entertainment, including social media and other video games, on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of player experience, brand awareness and reputation and access to distribution channels.
iGaming Segment
Our iGaming business segment provides a comprehensive suite of digital gaming content, distribution platforms, player account management systems, as well as various other iGaming content and services. The majority of our revenue is derived from casino-style game content, including a wide variety of internally developed and branded games as well as popular third-party provider games. These games are made available to iGaming operators via content aggregation platforms, including Open Gaming System, remote gaming servers and various other platforms. We also provide our Open Platform System (“OPS”), a player account management system which offers a wide range of reporting and administrative functions and tools providing operators full control over all areas of digital gaming operations. We continue to make progress on the U.S. licensing for launch of live casino and are on track to launch in early 2023. Generally, we host the play of our game content which is integrated with the online casino operators’ websites.
Competition
In our iGaming business, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers with other digital gaming entertainment companies that offer real-money digital casino games. Our primary real-money online casino games competitors include Evolution Gaming, Games Global, GAN, IGT, and Playtech.
Research and Development
We believe our ability to attract new Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming customers and retain existing customers depends in part on our ability to evolve and continue to develop our product lines and service offerings by continually developing differentiated products, hardware and systems technology and functionality to enhance player entertainment and/or customer profitability. Additionally, our ability to execute on our strategy (see above) is highly dependent on developing great game content and franchises across all three of our segments along with expanding the use of digital technologies to increase cross-platform play. Our gaming machines are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff, and our game content is designed primarily by internal game development studios who consider market trends and customer feedback. 
We have Gaming R&D personnel located in our Las Vegas, Nevada and Chicago, Illinois facilities. We have SciPlay personnel located primarily in Austin, Texas; Cedar Falls, Iowa; and Tel Aviv, Israel. We have iGaming R&D personnel based primarily in the United Kingdom, Greece and India. We also have game development studios in Las Vegas; Sydney, Australia; Bristol, England; Montreal, Canada; Stockholm, Sweden and additional R&D staff in Reno, Nevada and Vienna, Austria and in various other smaller locations. 
Intellectual Property
Many of our products use intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, patents and trade secrets. We consider our intellectual property rights to be, in the aggregate, material to our business. We protect our investment in R&D by seeking intellectual property protection as appropriate for our technologies and content. We also acquire and license intellectual property from third parties.
The terms of our patents vary based on the type of patent and the date and jurisdiction of filing or grant. The term of U.S. design patents expires 15 years from the date of grant, and the term of utility patents generally expires 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional patent application in a family of patents. The actual protection afforded by a patent depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the applicable country. Certain technologies, which are material to our businesses, are the subject of patents issued and patent applications currently pending in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our Gaming, SciPlay and iGaming businesses use our patented and patent-pending technologies in games and associated platforms and systems. In addition, under a patent cross-licensing agreement with IGT, we can offer games using patented game features from the patent portfolios of other members of IGT’s slot game features program.
We market many of our products under trademarks and copyrights that provide product differentiation and recognition and promote our portfolio of product offerings. All of our games feature elements that are subject to copyright rights and protection. In addition, we generally obtain trademark protection and often seek to register trademarks for the names and designs under which we market and license our products and games. Protections for trademarks exist in many countries, including the U.S., for as long as the trademark is registered and/or used. Registrations are generally issued for fixed, but renewable terms, although trademark rights may exist whether or not a mark is registered, and the duration of the registrations varies by country.
We believe that our use of both our own and third-party licensed brand names and related intellectual property contributes to the appeal and success of our products, and that our future ability to license, acquire or develop new brand names is important to our continued success. Therefore, we continue to invest in the recognition of our brands and brands that we license. Certain of our games are based on popular brands licensed from third parties, such as Hasbro, Inc.; Warner Bros. Consumer Products Inc.; Frank Sinatra Enterprises, LLC; ABG EPE IP LLC, Elvis Presley Enterprises, LLC; Danjaq, LLC and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer; John R. Cash Revocable Trust; and Universal Studios, parent company NBC Universal Film and Entertainment. 
From time to time, we become aware of potential infringement of our intellectual property by competitors and other third parties and consider what action, if any, to take in that regard, including litigation where appropriate. We are also subject to threatened or actual intellectual property-related claims by third parties from time to time. See the risk factors captioned “Our business depends on the protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information”, “We rely on the ability to use the intellectual property rights of third parties”, and “The intellectual property rights of others may prevent us from developing new products and services, entering new markets or may expose us to liability or costly litigation” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Production Processes, Sources and Availability of Components
We currently produce substantially all of our gaming machines through a mix of our manufacturing facilities and contracted third parties. We have finishing lines in Las Vegas; Sydney, Australia; Barcelona, Spain; Midrand, South Africa; and Manchester, England. These finishing lines allow for the completion and testing of our gaming machine assemblies from our facilities. We also refurbish used gaming machines primarily at our Las Vegas and Manchester facilities.
Manufacturing commitments are generally based on expected quarterly sales orders from customers. Due to uneven order flow from customers, component parts for gaming machines are purchased and assembled into partial products that are scheduled for just in time delivery to allow final assembly lead time to meet agreed customer delivery dates. Our gaming machine manufacturing processes generally consist of assembling component parts and sub-assemblies into a complete gaming machine. The level of completion and assembly varies by product platform and geographic region.
Shufflers are assembled in our Las Vegas facility and by third parties near Salzburg, Austria. The assembly of Shufflers includes various levels of sub-assemblies with completion and testing at one of our finishing lines described above. We do remanufacturing and refurbishment of shufflers in Las Vegas.
Hardware and component parts associated with our CMSs are purchased directly from the contract manufacturers and flow through our facilities, finishing lines as indicated in the above locations, with final assembly, testing and shipment to customers. These parts do not require a significant amount of assembly and are used primarily in systems implementations, which take place at customer locations.    
We place advance orders for certain gaming components with long lead times based on projected customer demand through our sales and operations planning process. The purchase horizon of components has increased as a result of the exceeding demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to normalize through the end of 2023 and return to normal levels in 2024.
We believe we currently have an adequate supply of component parts and raw materials used in the manufacturing of our gaming machines, shufflers and CMSs. We are continuously assessing any potential supply chain challenges in order to meet customer demand. We actively manage and mitigate supply chain risk in collaboration with engineering to specify and approve alternative components, dual sourcing, safety stock to deal with volatility in supply and demand, and management of the purchase lead time horizon to ensure we have sufficient materials available.
Seasonality
Our results of operations can fluctuate due to seasonal trends and other factors. Sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the second half of the year and slowest in the first half of the year, while revenue from our Participation gaming machines is generally highest in the spring and summer. Player activity for SciPlay is generally slower in the second and third quarters of the year, particularly during the summer months. Player activity for our iGaming business, specifically digital casino operations, is generally slower in the third quarter during the summer months and is generally higher in the fourth quarter. See the risk factor captioned “Our results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, and, therefore, our periodic operating results are not guarantees of future performance” under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Human Capital
Our global reach is made possible through the expertise, skill and dedicated efforts of our employees who serve customers in more than 100 countries on 6 continents.
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 6,100 persons worldwide, with approximately 2,700 employed domestically and 3,400 employed internationally.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Diversity, equity and inclusion are embedded in our core value of team spirit, by which we collaborate as one diverse and inclusive team with an upbeat, inventive passion for building great entertainment. In support of this core value, we have formulated a diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan and established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and task force in 2020 to make key decisions, review progress, communicate results and identify areas that require further development. We have invested in analysis of our diversity, equity and inclusion data and continue to implement hiring, training, recruiting and retention initiatives across our workforce in line with our diversity, equity and inclusion strategic plan. 
We are committed to creating an inclusive global gaming industry as a founding member of the All-In Diversity Project, a non-profit organization creating tools to advance the industry’s diversity, inclusion and workplace equality. As a 
founding member, we work collaboratively with additional partners to determine diversity, equity and inclusion expectations and standards for the gaming industry, while driving a conversation to establish global standards. 
We also help drive diversity across our industry by including minority, women, disabled, and/or veteran-owned businesses in our supply chain and by counting some small businesses and businesses in historically underutilized business zones among our suppliers. As one of the leading global suppliers of products and services to gaming operations and lotteries, we believe that diversity in our supplier base is good business. Our supplier diversity program encourages diverse businesses to provide materials and services that offer value and competitive pricing. We are proud to be a national corporate member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council.
Safety
The health and safety of our employees is a top priority of our leaders. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented work procedures that allow employees to work from home and collaborate remotely. We have also taken measures to keep our workforce safe by monitoring and reducing the impact of the outbreak, including putting in place a global crisis monitoring team, protocols for responding when employees are infected and enhanced cleaning procedures at all sites. 
Compensation and Benefits
L&W provides a competitive and comprehensive benefits program that is aligned with our business objectives and attempts to inspire employees to drive innovation and improve Company performance. In addition to cash and equity compensation, L&W offers medical, dental and vision plans; employee stock purchase plans; paid time off and paid holidays; company-paid disability; life insurance; 401(k) plans; flexible spending accounts; and employee assistance programs.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
We are committed to serving as responsible corporate stewards for our employees, partners and communities. We believe that our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) initiatives and our ESG priorities are an integral part of shaping our culture and underscore our commitment to be an employer of choice and positive influence in the industry and the communities in which we operate. Our CSR initiatives include the following key pillars:
•Community (Philanthropy);
•People (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion);
•Planet (Environmental Sustainability);
•Players (Responsible Gaming); and
•Corporate Governance (Code of Business Conduct).
All of our employees are expected to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct, which addresses key principles such as conflicts of interest, confidentiality, fiduciary responsibility and legal compliance. More information about our CSR initiatives can be found on our website. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
General
Each of our business segments is generally subject to extensive and evolving regulation. For the Gaming business segment, regulation customarily includes some form of licensing or regulatory screening of operators, suppliers, manufacturers and distributors and their applicable affiliates, their major shareholders, officers, directors and key employees. In addition, certain of our gaming products and technologies must be certified or approved in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Regulators review many facets of an applicant or holder of a license, including its financial stability, integrity and business experience. Any failure to receive a license or the loss of a license that we currently hold could have a material adverse effect on us or on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition. Each of our business segments is subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet and over mobile networks, especially in relation to privacy and security. Furthermore, for the SciPlay business segment, there is also significant opposition in some jurisdictions to interactive social gaming, including social casino gaming. For our iGaming business segment, although some states are expanding the availability of digital gaming, there have also been various state and federal bills proposed recently in the U.S. to restrict or prohibit digital gaming. Significant resources are being devoted to supporting these efforts. Although these efforts have generally not been successful, we cannot assure that laws restricting digital gaming will not be passed at either the federal or state level.
While we believe that we are in compliance with all material laws and regulatory requirements applicable to us, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement proceeding or that any such proceeding would not have a material adverse impact on us or our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.
We have developed and implemented a rigorous internal compliance program in an effort to ensure that we comply with legal requirements imposed in connection with our Gaming, SciPlay, and iGaming activities, as well as those generally applicable to all publicly traded companies. The compliance program is run on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Compliance Officer with legal advice provided by attorneys in our legal and compliance departments and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors, which is comprised of employee and non-employee directors and a non-employee gaming law expert. While we are firmly committed to full compliance with all applicable laws, we cannot assure that our compliance program will prevent the violation of one or more laws or regulations, or that a violation by us or an employee will not result in the imposition of a monetary fine or suspension or revocation of one or more of our licenses.
In the European Union (“EU”), various judgments by the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) have addressed the approaches adopted by certain member states to restrict and/or regulate gaming. Topics addressed in those judgments include the ability of member states to grant, or to maintain, monopolies for gaming activities and the power of member states to limit access by gaming providers established elsewhere in the EU. In December 2017, the European Commission dropped all enforcement actions related to gambling in an effort to change the way it enforces EU law, leaving compliance with EU laws to national courts. In September 2021, following a request from the European Commission in April 2018, the European Committee for Standardisation (“CEN”) adopted a reporting standard in support of supervision of online gambling services by the gambling regulatory authorities of EU member states. This is a voluntary tool to facilitate the flow of information between regulators and gambling businesses. In January 2023, the members of the CEN voted to create a European standard on markers of harm for online gambling.
While we believe that we have developed appropriate procedures and policies to comply with the requirements of these evolving laws and legal pronouncements, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our customers will not become the subject of law enforcement proceedings or that any such proceedings would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business plans. Furthermore, laws and regulations applicable to gaming in U.S. and international jurisdictions are subject to change, and the effect of such changes on our ongoing and potential operations cannot be predicted with certainty.
From time to time, we retain government affairs representatives in various U.S. and international jurisdictions to advise elected and appointed officials and the public concerning our views on gaming legislation, monitor such legislation and advise us in our relations with gaming authorities.
Gaming
We provide our games, gaming machines, gaming systems, table products and related products and services in legal gaming jurisdictions worldwide. The manufacture, distribution, provision and operation of our gaming products and services is subject to regulation and approval by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal and foreign agencies. The primary purposes of these rules are to (1) ensure the responsibility, financial stability and character of the parties involved in these activities through licensing and registration requirements, (2) ensure the integrity and compliance of our gaming products and services and (3) prohibit the use of gaming products and services at unauthorized locations or for the benefit of undesirable parties.
Typically, gaming regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate are established by statute and are administered by a regulatory agency with broad authority to interpret gaming regulations and to regulate gaming activities. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we are licensed:
•adopt additional rules and regulations under the implementing statutes; 
•investigate violations of gaming regulations; 
•enforce gaming regulations and impose disciplinary sanctions for violations of such laws, including fines, penalties and revocation of gaming licenses; 
•review the character and fitness of manufacturers, distributors and operators of gaming products and services and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure; 
•grant licenses for the manufacture, distribution and operation of gaming products and services; 
•review and approve transactions (such as acquisitions, material commercial transactions, securities offerings and debt transactions); and 
•establish and collect related fees and/or taxes.
We believe we hold all of the licenses and permits necessary to conduct our business. We are authorized to sell, lease or operate our gaming products and services in approximately 468 jurisdictions worldwide (including jurisdictions that do not require licensing), including approximately 185 international gaming jurisdictions.
In addition, a number of U.S. states authorize wagering on VLTs at state regulated and licensed facilities. Although some states restrict VLTs to already existing wagering facilities, others permit these machines to be placed at venues such as bars, restaurants, truck stops and other specifically licensed gaming facilities. In addition, all of the Canadian provinces and various other international jurisdictions have authorized VLTs.
Regulatory requirements vary among jurisdictions, but the majority of jurisdictions require licenses, permits or findings of suitability for our company, individual officers, directors, major stockholders and key employees. Our gaming hardware and software also must be approved either by a gaming authority laboratory or a private laboratory authorized by the gaming authority.
SciPlay
SciPlay is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies operating online, including over the internet and mobile networks, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact business, revenue and results. SciPlay is also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of player data. Such regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) from the EU, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act are recent, untested laws and regulations that have and could further affect SciPlay’s operations and business. The extent of the potential impact is unknown.
There is significant opposition in some jurisdictions to social and social casino gaming. Anti-gaming groups that specifically target social casino games are located in several states and countries. Such opposition could lead these jurisdictions to adopt legislation or impose a regulatory framework to govern social gaming or social casino gaming specifically. These opposition efforts could lead to a prohibition on social gaming or social casino gaming altogether, restrict SciPlay’s ability to advertise its games or substantially increase costs to comply with regulations, all of which could have an adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing, scope or terms of any such legislation or regulation or the extent to which they may affect SciPlay’s business.
iGaming
In the U.S., the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) prohibits among other things, the acceptance by a business of a wager by means of the internet where such wager is prohibited by any federal or state law where initiated, received or otherwise made. Under UIGEA severe criminal and civil sanctions may be imposed on the owners and operators of such systems and on financial institutions that process wagering transactions. The law contains a safe harbor for wagers placed within a single state (disregarding intermediate routing of the transmission) where the method of placing the bet and receiving the bet is authorized by that state’s law, provided the underlying regulations establish appropriate age and location verification.
On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court of the U.S. overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”), a decision that opened up a path to legalization of sports wagering across the country. Following this ruling, at least 30 states and the District of Columbia have legalized some form of sports wagering, with some of those states permitting online sports wagering. Other states are considering legislation that would permit legal sports wagering, both land based and online.
In late 2011, the Office of Legal Counsel of the DOJ (the “OLC”) issued an opinion which concluded that the prohibitions of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) were limited to sports gambling and thus did not apply to other forms of wagering (the “2011 DOJ opinion”). In January 2019, the OLC published a legal opinion dated November 2, 2018 (the “2018 DOJ opinion”), which concluded that the 2011 DOJ opinion had incorrectly interpreted the Wire Act and that the restrictions on the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets and wagers in the Wire Act were not limited to sports gambling but instead applied to all bets and wagers. The OLC also found that the enactment of the UIGEA described above did not modify the scope of the Wire Act. The DOJ later issued memoranda directing federal law enforcement agencies to refrain from enforcing the conclusions of the 2018 DOJ opinion for activities other than sports betting until June 30, 2020. No official extension of the forbearance period was ever announced, but on January 20, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued an opinion that the Wire Act applies only to the interstate transmission of wire communications related to sports gambling and not to all bets and wagers. With the DOJ’s subsequent announcement that it would not seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court, it would seem to be settled that the Wire Act applies to interstate sports wagering only. However, we are unable to determine what future impact the 2018 DOJ opinion, or the impact of any other challenge to the 2018 DOJ opinion, will have on our iGaming business or our customers.
Currently we have launched in six states in the U.S. A number of states in the U.S. are currently considering regulation of iGaming. We cannot assure that laws permitting digital gaming will be enacted.
On December 19, 2019, the U.K. Government confirmed the proposed review of the Gambling Act 2005. The review started on December 8, 2020 with the publication of terms of reference The call for evidence ran for 16 weeks and closed on March 31, 2021. The U.K. Government is currently considering submissions in advance of publishing a White Paper, which has been repeatedly delayed due to the political and economic climate in the U.K. In the likely next stage of the review, the U.K. Government is likely to make recommendations only, setting out options for reform, rather than a clear recommended course of action. To varying degrees, a number of European governments have taken steps to change the regulation of internet wagering (also known as online gambling) through the implementation of new or revised licensing and taxation regimes, with increasingly stringent requirements particularly on business-to-consumer businesses in relation to responsible gambling and affordability checks. Also, some jurisdictions impose sanctions on unlicensed providers. Countries outside Europe and the U.S. have also begun evaluating digital gaming regulation and an increase in regulated markets outside of the U.S. and Europe is likely to continue. We now have 21 operators live in Ontario, Canada, following its change in iGaming regulation in the second quarter of 2022. Some of our competitors may be more willing to provide internet wagering in countries where the relevant laws and regulations are unclear or not uniformly enforced, putting us at a competitive disadvantage if we do not provide services related to internet wagering in such countries.
We continue to devote significant attention to monitoring these developments. However, we cannot predict the timing, scope or terms of any state, federal or foreign regulations relating to digital gaming and sports betting.
