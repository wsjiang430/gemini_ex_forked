  ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
  
  Company Overview
  
 Issuer Direct Corporation (Issuer Direct Corporation and its subsidiaries are hereinafter collectively referred to as “Issuer Direct”, the “Company”, “We” or “Our” unless otherwise noted). Our corporate offices are located at 500 Perimeter Park Drive, Suite D, Morrisville, North Carolina, 27560.
  
 We announce material financial information to our investors using our investor relations website, Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, investor events, news and earnings releases, public conference calls, webcasts and social media. We use these channels to communicate with our investors and the public about our company, our products and services and other related matters. It is possible that information we post on some of these channels could be deemed to be material information. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media and others interested in our company to review the information we post to all of our channels, including our social media accounts.
  
 Issuer Direct is an industry-leading global communications and compliance company focusing on the needs of corporate issuers. Issuer Direct's principal platform, Platform id.™, empowers users by thoughtfully integrating the most relevant tools, technologies and products, thus eliminating the complexity associated with producing and distributing their business communications and financial information.
  
 We work with a diverse customer base, which not only includes corporate issuers and private companies, but also banks, professional firms, such as investor relations and public relations firms, as well as the accounting and legal communities. We also sell products and services to others in the financial services industry, including brokerage firms, investment banks and mutual funds. Corporate issuers and their service providers utilize Platform id. and related services from document creation all the way to dissemination to regulatory bodies, platforms and shareholders. Private companies primarily use our news distribution and webcasting products and services to disseminate their message globally.
  
 In order to provide a good representation of our business and reflect our platform first engagement strategy, we report revenue in two revenue streams: (i) Platform and Technology and (ii) Services. Due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers effective as of January 1, 2018, we reclassified revenue associated with the Company’s shareholder outreach offering that included both electronic dissemination and physical delivery of a customer’s annual report. Historically, revenue from these bundled contracts was reported in the Services revenue stream because an allocation between electronic and physical hardcopy distribution was not made, however, under ASC 606, a portion of the revenue from these contracts is required to be allocated to the Platform and Technology revenue stream in accordance with stand-alone contracts for the shareholder outreach subscription. As a result, revenue of $683,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, was reclassified from Services revenue to Platform and Technology revenue.

 Set forth below is an infographic depicting the modules included in Platform id. and the services we provide:
  
 
  Platform and Technology
  
 As we continue our transition to a cloud-based subscription business, we expect the Platform and Technology portion of our business to continue to increase over the next several years, both in terms of overall revenue and as compared to the Services portion of our business. Platform and Technology revenue grew to 60% of total revenue for 2018, compared to 56% of our revenue for 2017 and approximately 44% of our revenue in 2016. Our ACCESSWIRE® news distribution offering represented a majority of the year over year growth in our Platform and Technology revenue during 2017 and 2018 and continues to lead our transition to a full platform solution. Also contributing to the growth in the percentage of Platform and Technology revenue is our focus on our platform first engagement strategy and converting customers which historically relied on us for services work to utilizing Platform id.
  
 As part of our Platform and Technology strategy, we have been working with several select stock exchanges, whereby we make available certain parts of Platform id. under agreement, to integrate our offerings. Such partnerships should yield increased exposure to a targeted customer base that could impact our revenue and overall brand in the market.
  
 Additionally, we plan to continue to invest in both our current Platform id. offering as well as additional offerings that we plan to incorporate into Platform id., which we believe provide long term opportunities for our platform business. We believe understanding the shareholder composition of a company is an opportunity that is underserved by the market today. We believe we have addressed that gap by releasing a new module during the fourth quarter of 2018 centered around the professional conference organizer (PCO). This subscription is being licensed to investor conference organizers which together hold an estimated 1,000 plus events a year. This product is integrated with and enhances our communications module subscription offerings of newswire, newsrooms, webcasting and shareholder targeting. In addition, we have developed an insight and analytics subscription add-on module to Platform id., which enables our customers to better understand their shareholder and investor engagement profile. This module is targeted to be initially rolled out in the first quarter of 2019. Both modules are expected to broaden our presence in the market by providing our customers the ability to monitor the shareholder from when they first meet an investor to when they become an actual shareholder. These advancements leverage our current application technology framework and give us an opportunity to further expand our customer and user base.

  Platform id.
  
 Platform id. is our primary cloud-based subscription platform that efficiently and effectively helps manage the events of our customers seeking to distribute their messaging to key constituents, investors, markets and regulatory systems around the globe. Currently, Platform id. consists of several related but distinct shareholder communications and compliance modules. Certain of these capabilities were historically part of our disclosure management and shareholder communications offerings, but are now included into our fully integrated platform.
  
 Within most of our target markets, customers require several individual services and/or software providers to meet their investor relations, communications and compliance needs. We believe Platform id. can address all those needs in a single, secure, cloud-based platform - one that offers a company control, increases efficiencies, demonstrates clear value and, most importantly, delivers consistent and compliant messaging from one centralized platform.
  
 While the complete platform is available for a single subscription fee, companies also have the flexibility to choose one or more of the specific modules that fit their needs.
  
  Communications Modules
  
 Our press release offering, which is marketed under the brand, ACCESSWIRE, is a cost-effective, Regulation Fair Disclosure (“FD”), news dissemination and media outreach service. The ACCESSWIRE product offering focuses on press release distribution for both private and publicly held companies globally. ACCESSWIRE is fast becoming a competitive alternative to the traditional newswires because we have been able to integrate customer editing features and improve our targeting and growing analytics reporting systems, which we believe will enable us to add new customers for 2019 and beyond. We have also been able to maintain flexible pricing by offering our customers the option to pay per release or enter into longer-term subscriptions. Currently, approximately 55% of our ACCESSWIRE revenue is on a subscription basis.
  
 On July 3, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Filing Services Canada Inc. (“FSCwire”), which not only increased our customer base, but more importantly increased our global footprint, distribution capabilities and editorial team. We recently completed the integration of FSCwire and rebranded it as ACCESSWIRE Canada, and will now begin to focus on offering those customers the full suite of products included in Platform id.
  
 We will continue to brand our press release offerings under the name ACCESSWIRE, which we believe will solidify our market position in the newswire business. Our ACCESSWIRE news editing offering is available within our core Platform id. subscription or as a stand-alone module.
  
 ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon several key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely on for other investor outreach offerings. A disruption in any of these partnerships could have a materially adverse impact on our business.
  
 Platform id. also includes our targeting and outreach database and intelligence analytics module. This module is centered around both our shareholder communications and news distribution offerings. We anticipate the analytics component will become a focal point for Platform id. in the future, as customers become increasingly interested in shareholder interest and real-time alerts to vital data points throughout the day.
  
 Over the past two years, we have been focused on refining the model of digital distribution of our customers’ message to the investment community and beyond. This has been accomplished by integrating our shareholder outreach module, formerly known as Investor Network, into and with Platform id. Most of the customers subscribing to this module today are historical PrecisionIR (“PIR”) – Annual Report Service (“ARS”) users, as well as new customers purchasing the entire Platform id. subscription. We have migrated some of the customers from the traditional ARS business into this new digital subscription business. However, there can be no assurances these customers will continue using this digital platform in the long term if market conditions or shareholder interest is not present.
  
 We estimate there are over 5,000 companies in North America conducting earnings events each quarter that include teleconference, webcast or both as part of their events. Platform id. also incorporates other elements of the earnings event, including earnings date/call announcement, earnings press release and SEC Form 8-K filings. There are a handful of our competitors that can offer this integrated full service solution today. However, we believe our real-time event setup and integrated approach offers a more effective way to manage the process as well as attract an audience of investors.

 The earnings event industry is a highly competitive space with the majority of the business being driven from practitioners in investor relations and communications firms. We have invested time and financial resources developing and integrating systems and processes within Platform id. by creating an application programming interface (“API”). This API will allow publishers to query an industry or a single company’s current and past earnings calls and present those webcasts on their platforms, under a subscription to Platform id. Initially, this has been broadly distributed via our Investor Network platform, with expectations that partners and publishers will license this dataset for their platforms in the future. We believe this offering will further increase our brand awareness. Additionally, as a commitment to broadening the reach of our webcast platform, all events will be broadcast live within our shareholder outreach module, which will drive new audiences and give companies the ability to view their analytics and engagement of each event. We believe these analytics will increase the demand for our webcasting platform among the corporate issuer community.
  
 On January 3, 2019, we acquired the VisualWebcaster Platform (“VWP”) from Onstream Media Corporation. VWP is a leading cloud-based earnings webcast, webinar and training platform that delivers live and on-demand streaming of events to audiences of all sizes. VWP allows customers to create, produce and deliver events, which will integrate perfectly into Platform id. We believe by acquiring VWP, we have significantly strengthened our webcasting product and Platform id. offering as well as acquired over 120 customers, some of which are Fortune 500 companies.
  
 Our investor relations content network is another component of Platform id., which is used to create the investor relations’ tab of a public company’s website. This investor relations content network is a robust series of data feeds including news feeds, stock feeds, fundamentals, regulatory filings, corporate governance and many other components that are aggregated from a majority of the major exchanges and news distribution outlets around the world. Customers can subscribe to one or more of these data feeds from us or as a component of a fully designed and hosted website for pre-IPO, reporting companies and partners seeking to display our content on their corporate sites. The clear benefit to our investor relations module is its integration into and with the rest of Platform id., meaning companies can produce content for public distribution and it is automatically linked to their corporate site, distributed to targeted groups and placed into and with our data feed partners.
  
  Compliance Modules
  
 Platform id.’s disclosure reporting module is a document conversion, editing and filing offering, which is designed for reporting companies and professionals seeking to insource the document drafting, editing and filing processes to the SEC’s EDGAR system and SEDAR, which is the Canadian equivalent of EDGAR. This module is available in both a secure public cloud within our Platform id. subscription, as well as in a private cloud option for corporations, mutual funds and the legal community looking to further enhance their internal document process. As this module has begun to be adopted by our customers, we have seen a negative impact on our legacy disclosure conversion services business. However, the margins associated with our Platform and Technology business compared to our Services business are higher and align with our long-term strategy, and as such, we believe this module will have a positive impact on our compliance business going forward.
  
 Toward the end of 2017, we completed upgrades to our disclosure reporting product to include tagging functionality that meets newly mandated SEC requirements. On June 28, 2018, the SEC voted to adopt rules mandating the use of Inline XBRL (Inline Extensible Business Reporting Language or “iXBRL”) for the submission of financial statement information to the SEC. The new requirements for iXBRL will have a three-year phase in beginning for large accelerated filers that use U.S. GAAP to be compliant for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2019, for accelerated filers to begin reporting for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2020 and for all other filers to begin reporting for fiscal periods ending on or after June 15, 2021. These upgrades also include meeting new SEC mandates for foreign filers that compile financial statements using International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) to be able to utilize our cloud-based platform. Foreign filers with fiscal year’s ending on or after December 15, 2017, are now required to begin reporting their financial statements in XBRL with the SEC in 2018. Platform id. has adopted the new IFRS taxonomy into and with its new disclosure upgrade for iXBRL to ensure our customers are able to meet these new mandates.
  
 Our whistleblower module is an add-on product within Platform id. This system delivers secure notifications and basic incident workflow management processes that align with a company’s corporate governance whistleblower policy. As a supported and subsidized bundle product of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) offerings, we hope we will gain relationships with new IPO customers and other larger cap customers listed on the NYSE.

 A valued subscription add-on in our Platform id. offering is the ability for our customers to gain access to real-time information of their shareholders, stock ledgers, reports, and issue new shares from our cloud-based stock transfer module. Managing the capitalization table of a public company or pre-IPO company is the cornerstone of corporate governance and transparency, and as such companies and community banks have chosen us to assist with their stock transfer needs, including bond offerings and dividend management. This is an industry which has experienced declining overall revenues as it was affected by the replacement of paper certificates with digital certificates. However, we have recently been focused on selling subscriptions of the stock transfer component of our platform, allowing customers to gain access to our cloud-based system in order to move shares or query shareholders, which has resulted in a more efficient process for both our customers and us.
  
 Our proxy module is marketed as a fully integrated, real-time voting platform for our customers and their shareholders of record. This module is utilized for every annual meeting and/or special meeting we manage for our customer base and offers both full-set mailing and notice of internet availability options.
  
  Services
  
 As we focus on expanding our cloud-based subscription business, we expect to see a decrease in the overall revenues associated with our Services business. Typically, Services revenues relate to activities where substantial resources are required to perform the work for our customers and/or hard goods are utilized as part of the engagement. To date, most of our Services have been related to converting and editing SEC documents and XBRL tagging, which has been our core disclosure business over the last 12 years. Services also include telecommunications services and print, fulfillment and delivery of stock certificates, proxy materials or annual reports depending on each customer’s engagement. Services are not required, but are optional for customers that utilize our Platform id.
  
 Our investor outreach and engagement offering, formerly known as the ARS, was acquired from PIR in 2013. The ARS business has existed for over 20 years primarily as a physical hard copy delivery service of annual reports and prospectuses. We continue to operate a portion of this legacy system for those who opt to take advantage of physical delivery of material. Additionally, we continue to attempt to migrate the install base over to subscriptions of our digital outreach engagement module within Platform id. We believe we will continue to see further attrition of both customers and revenues in this category as we focus our efforts on our Platform and Technology business.
  
  Our vision - To be the trusted platform that brings the issuer and investor together.
  
  Our overall strategy includes:
  
  Expansion of Current Customers
  
 We expect to continue to see demand for our products within our customer base. As we transition from a services oriented business, our focus is to migrate customer contracts over to subscription-based contracts for our entire Platform id. offering. This will naturally help us move from a transaction based revenue model to a recurring subscription-based revenue model, which gives us more consistent, predictable revenue patterns and hopefully creates longer lasting customer relationships. Additionally, as part of our customer expansion efforts, we are committed to working beyond the single point of contact and into the entire C suite (CEO, CFO, IRO, Corporate Secretary, etc.) of an organization which will help us further drive user subscription revenues on top of Platform id. subscriptions.
 Focus on Organic Growth
  
 Our primary growth strategy continues to be selling our cloud-based offerings via Platform id. to new customers under a subscription arrangement, whereas in the past we were inclined to sell a single point solution. Selling a single subscription to our entire platform allows us to provide our customers with a competitively priced, complete solution for their communications and compliance needs. Our strategy of selling our cloud-based offerings via Platform id. to all customers under a subscription agreement should benefit us by moving away from selling individual solutions within highly commoditized markets that are experiencing pricing pressures.
 New Offerings
  
 During 2019 and going forward, we will continue to innovate, improve and build new applications into and with our platform, with the ultimate objective of developing applications in combination, that are not offered by our competitors. As a company focused on technology offerings, we understand the importance of advancements and fully appreciate the risks and consequences of losing our market position - a very common mistake many technology companies have made. The pursuit of technological innovation is and has been a part of our overall strategy as an organization over the last several years.

 This year we plan to bring to market several new enhancements and platform upgrades targeted at both our current install base as well as new customers. The first of our new offerings is our Professional Conference Organizer (PCO), which was released in the fourth quarter of 2018. It is an investor conference marketing, planning and event scheduling cloud-based module integrated within Platform id.
  
 The PCO subscription module includes the following:
  
   –
 Front end website, event promotion and email marketing

   –
 Real-time dashboards

   –
 Limitless Agenda and tracks for virtually any event

   –
 Custom questions and survey tools

   –
 Customizable 1x1 meetings

   –
 Mobile App

   –
 Badge printing

   –
 Lodging API’s

 
 We are also looking for opportunities to add to this module as we gain market traction with conference organizers, corporate access professionals and investment banks. Moving our customers closer to their investors is a part of our core business strategy, so it is critical we have a platform that puts our customers in the best position to tell their story.
  
 Additionally, part of our continued strategy from 2018 is to bring to market our insight and analytics engine for our Platform id. product offering, which we tested with a close group of professionals and customers in late 2018. The insights and analytics component of Platform id. will give our customers the ability to see shareholder and investor engagement from the source, (i.e. at a conference, road show, earnings event, corporate website, Investor Network, affiliate networks and thousands of distribution points from our already robust news distribution network.), which we believe will enable them to better assess the effectiveness of investor outreach programs and target potential investors more effectively.
  
  Acquisition Strategy
  
 We will continue to evaluate complimentary verticals and systems that we can integrate well into our current platforms. These opportunities typically need to be accretive and consistent with what we have done in the past. We will continue to maintain our product and technology focus, so it is likely we will look for acquisitions in areas we currently generate revenues and/or see clear opportunities to leverage our strengths to disrupt existing markets. In these potential transactions, we will look for key people, technologies and long-term customers that will further enhance our overall market position.
 Sales and Marketing
  
 During 2019, we will continue to strengthen our brands in the market by working aggressively to expand our new customer footprint and continue to cross sell to increase average revenue per user. Since our platform, systems and operations are built to handle growth, we can leverage them to produce consistently high margins and increased cash flows without a proportional increase in our capital or operating expenses.
  
 Our global sales organization is responsible for generating new customer opportunities and expanding our current customers. We ended 2018 with a multi-tier organization of sales personnel, made up of Strategic Account Managers and Business Development Managers. We believe this structured approach is the most efficient and effective way to reach new customers and also grow our current install base. The total compensation packages for these teams are heavily weighted with commission compensation to incent sales. All members of the team have sales quotas. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 16 full-time equivalent sales personnel and are on track to add more Business Development Managers in 2019 to focus on selling new subscriptions of Platform id.
  
 Our marketing organization has been focused on both new customer acquisition as well as campaigns to educate current customers on the advantages of our entire Platform id. Additionally, our marketing team has expanded their focus on investor conferences, strategic exchange partnerships and private company marketing activities in order to continue to scale our business long term.

 Additionally, our executive team plays a critical role in our sales process, assisting the organization and customers with new offerings, cross selling opportunities and channel development; because our overall organization is small, we benefit from this approach and believe this is key to our future success.
  
  Technology
  
 We will continue to make investments in our technology, as we transition our business from a historically service-oriented business to a cloud-based subscription organization. In all of our offerings, quality, support, and scalability as well as the need to preserve the confidential content of our customers are of utmost importance and part of our core values.
  
 During 2018, we engaged a national security consulting firm to identify, address and create policies and plans which enable us to mitigate our cybersecurity and information vulnerabilities on both a short-term and long-term basis. We believe having a strong cyber and information security policy is not only necessary to maintain our current business model but also important to attract new customers. We plan to continue to work closely with this firm and others to ensure our security policies meet our customers’ needs and requirements.
  
  Industry Overview
  
 Our industry benefits from increased regulatory requirements and the need for platforms and systems to manage these new regulations. Additionally, the industry, along with cloud-based technologies, have matured considerably over the past several years, whereby corporate issuers and communication professionals are seeking platforms and systems to do some, if not all the work themselves. We are well positioned in this new environment to benefit from software licensing and further advancements of Platform id.
  
 The business services industry as it relates to compliance and communications is highly fragmented, with hundreds of independent service companies that provide a range of financial reporting, document management services and with a wide range of printing and technology software providers. The demands for many of our services historically have been cyclical and reliant on capital market activity. During 2018, we invested heavily in growing several new product offerings beyond our traditional compliance reporting and transaction services business. We believe these new offerings will afford us the ability to reduce our revenue seasonality and provide a new baseline of recurring annualized contracts under our new subscription-based business.
  
 According to Burton-Taylor Media Intelligence and 2017 Frost & Sullivan reports, the global communications services market is $4.2+ billion in annual spend. This total consists of spending on earnings events, press releases, engagement and targeting and investor relations platforms globally. The key drivers of growth in our industry relate to changing regulatory requirements, new innovated platform technologies and typical industry consolidations. We believe we have a significant competitive advantage by innovating our technology and workflow automation solutions.
  
  Competition
  
 Despite some significant consolidation in recent years, our industry remains both highly fragmented and extremely competitive. The success of our products and services are generally based on price, quality and the ability to service customer demands. Management has been focused on offsetting these risks relating to competition as well as the seasonality by introducing our cloud-based subscription platforms, with significantly higher margins, clear competitive advantages and scalability to withstand market and pricing pressures.
  
 We also review our operations on a regular basis to balance growth with opportunities to maximize efficiencies and support our long-term strategic goals. We believe by blending our workflow technologies with our legacy service offerings we are able to offer a comprehensive set of products and solutions to each of our customers that most competitors cannot offer today.
  
 We believe we are positioned to be the public company platform of choice as a cost-effective alternative to both small regional providers and global providers. We also believe we benefit from our location in North Carolina, as we do not experience significant competition for sales, customer service, or production personnel.

  Customers
  
 Our customers include a wide variety of public and private companies, mutual funds, law firms, brokerage firms, investment banks, individuals, and other institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we did work for approximately 3,700 customers on our ACCESSWIRE platform and 1,200 customers through our other products and services. We did not have any customers during the year ended December 31, 2018 that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue and one customer which represented approximately 12% of our year end accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018.
 Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed seventy full-time employees as compared to sixty-six full-time employees at December 31, 2017, none of which are represented by a union. Our employees work in our corporate offices in North Carolina, and in other offices throughout North America and the United Kingdom.
 Facilities
  
 Our headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. In October 2015, we agreed to an extension on our current lease to extend the maturity through October 2019. Our current office includes 16,059 square feet of office space. Additionally, we have an office in Salt Lake City, Utah and a shared office facility in London, England, both of which are on a short term lease. As part of our acquisition of VWP, we assumed a three-year lease for an office in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida and two short term leases for locations in New York City, New York.
 Insurance
  
 We maintain both a general business liability policy and an errors and omissions policy specific to our industry and operations. We believe that our insurance policies provide adequate coverage for all reasonable risks associated with operating our business. Additionally, we maintain a Directors and Officers insurance policy, which is standard for our industry and size. We also maintain key man life insurance on our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and one other key individual.
 Regulations
  
 The securities and financial services industries generally are subject to regulation in the United States and elsewhere. Regulatory policies in the United States and the rest of the world are tasked with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets with protecting the interests of both issuers and shareholders.
  
 In the United States, corporate issuers are subject to regulation under both federal and state laws, which often require public disclosure and regulatory filings. At the federal level, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulates the securities industry, along with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, formally known as NASD, and NYSE market regulations, various stock exchanges, and other self-regulatory organizations (“SRO”).
  
 In the European Union (EU), the securities and reporting authorities tend to be based on exchanges as well as individual country disclosure requirements. We currently work with our stock exchange partners to deliver our solutions. We believe this is the best approach as this market is highly complex and divided in comparison to our North American markets.
  
 We operate our filing agent business and transfer agent business under the supervision and regulations of the SEC.
  
 Our transfer agency business, Direct Transfer, LLC, is subject to certain regulations, which are governed, without limitation by the SEC, with respect to registration with the SEC, annual reporting, examination, internal controls, tax reporting and escheatment services. Our transfer agency is currently approved to handle the securities of NYSE, NASDAQ and OTC securities.
  
 Our mission is to assist corporate issuers with these regulations, communication and compliance of rules imposed by regulatory bodies. The majority of our business involves the distribution of content, either electronically or on paper, to governing bodies and shareholders alike. We are licensed under these regulations to disseminate, communicate and or solicit on behalf of our customers, the issuers.
