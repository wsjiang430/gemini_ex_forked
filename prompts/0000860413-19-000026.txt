Recent Acquisitions
On August 16, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Northwest Bancorporation, Inc. (“Northwest”), the parent company of Inland Northwest Bank (“INB”), a Spokane, Washington based community bank with 20 banking offices across Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Consideration for the acquisition totaled $176.3 million, consisting of the issuance of 3.84 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock valued at $45.15 per share, the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ stock exchange on the acquisition date. The Company paid approximately $3.0 million in cash related to Northwest warrants, which was included in the consideration paid. Holders of each share of Northwest common stock received 0.516 shares of First Interstate Class A common stock for each share of Northwest common stock. Additionally, all Northwest stock purchase warrants outstanding immediately prior to the close of the transaction were canceled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment as provided in the Agreement. Unvested Northwest restricted stock awards outstanding immediately prior to the close of the transaction vested and were considered issued and outstanding at acquisition close. Integration of INB into FIB was completed on November 9, 2018.

Community Banking
Community banking encompasses commercial and consumer banking services provided through our Bank, primarily the acceptance of deposits; extensions of credit; mortgage loan origination and servicing; and trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services. Our community banking philosophy emphasizes providing customers with commercial and consumer banking products and services locally using a personalized service approach while strengthening the communities in our market areas through community service activities. We grant our banking offices significant authority in delivering products in response to local market considerations and customer needs. This authority enables our banking offices to remain competitive by responding quickly to local market conditions and enhances their relationships with the customers they serve. We also require accountability by having company-wide standards and established limits on the authority and discretion of each banking office. This combination of authority and accountability allows our banking offices to provide personalized customer service and be in close contact with our communities, while at the same time promoting strong performance and remaining focused on our overall financial performance.

Lending Activities

We offer real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We have comprehensive credit policies establishing company-wide underwriting and documentation standards to assist management in the lending process and to limit our risk. Each loan must meet minimum underwriting standards specified in our credit policies. Minimum underwriting standards generally specify that loans: (i) are made to borrowers located within our market footprint with the exception of participation loans and loans to national accounts; (ii) are made only for identified legal purposes; (iii) have specifically identified sources of repayment; (iv) mature within designated maximum maturity periods that coincide with repayment sources; (v) are appropriately collateralized whenever possible; (vi) are supported by current credit information; (vii) do not exceed the Bank’s legal lending limit; (viii) include medium-term fixed interest rates or variable rates that are adjusted within designated time frames; and (ix) require a flood determination prior to closing. In addition, our minimum underwriting standards include lending limitations to prevent concentrations of credit in agricultural, commercial, real estate or consumer loans. Further, each minimum underwriting standard must be documented, with exceptions noted, as part of the loan approval process.  

While each loan must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers and branch loan officers are granted levels of credit authority in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area. Lending authorities are established at individual, branch and market levels. Credit authorities are established and assigned based on the credit experience and credit acumen of each branch loan officer. Credit authority is under the direction of our Chief Credit Officer or such officer’s designee and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Credits over the authority of branch loan officers are approved by our credit risk management group.
Deposit Products

We offer traditional depository products including checking, savings and time deposits. Deposits at the Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, (“FDIC”), up to statutory limits. We also offer repurchase agreements primarily to commercial and municipal depositors. Under repurchase agreements, we sell investment securities held by the Bank to our customers under an agreement to repurchase the investment securities at a specified time or on demand. All outstanding repurchase agreements are due in one business day.
Wealth Management

We provide a wide range of trust, employee benefit, investment management, insurance, agency and custodial services to individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. These services include the administration of estates and personal trusts; management of investment accounts for individuals, employee benefit plans and charitable foundations; and insurance planning. 
Centralized Services

We have centralized certain operational activities to provide consistent service levels to our customers company-wide, to gain efficiency in management of those activities and to ensure regulatory compliance. Centralized operational activities generally support our banking offices in the delivery of products and services to customers and include marketing; credit review; credit cards; mortgage loan sales and servicing; indirect consumer loan purchasing and processing; loan collections; and other operational activities. Additionally, specialized staff support services have been centralized to enable our branches to serve their markets more efficiently. These services include credit risk management, finance, accounting, human resource management, internal audit, facilities management, technology, risk management, compliance and other support services.

We operate in markets that have a diverse employment base covering numerous industries and we believe our community bank approach to providing client service is a competitive advantage that strengthens the Company’s ability to effectively provide financial products and services to businesses and individuals in its markets.
Competition
There is significant competition among commercial banks in our market areas. We also compete with other providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, financial technology companies, internet banks, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and certain government agencies as well as major retailers, all actively engaged in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of our competitors have greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may offer other services that we do not provide. We generally compete on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, available loan and deposit products, rates of interest charged on loans, rates of interest paid for deposits, and the availability and pricing of services such as trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services.
Employees
We recognize quality, engaged employees are critical to our ability to serve our customers and to the success of our company. We strive to be the employer of choice in the markets we serve. At December 31, 2018, we employed 2,330 full-time equivalent employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Regulation and Supervision
Regulatory Authorities
We are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws. A description of certain material laws and regulations applicable to us is summarized below. This description is not intended to summarize all laws and regulations applicable to us. Descriptions of statutory and regulatory provisions and requirements do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to those provisions. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal banking regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance that may impose additional regulatory obligations or otherwise affect the conduct of our business. Additionally, proposals to change laws and regulations are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and their impact on the Company cannot be determined with any certainty. 
As a public company, we are subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 4

As a financial and bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and to supervision, regulation and regular examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). 
The Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by its primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve, the Montana Department of Administration, Division of Banking and Financial Institutions (“Montana Division”), and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).
The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), of the FDIC in the manner and to the extent provided by law. The Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), and FDIC regulations relating to deposit insurance and may also be subject to supervision and examination by the FDIC.
The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), and Federal Reserve. The OCC and Federal Reserve have risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy with regard to a banking organization’s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of loan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements.
The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), alters the competitive structure of the debit card payment processing industry and caps debit card interchange fees for banks with over $10 billion in assets. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. 
The extensive regulation of the Bank limits both the activities in which the Bank may engage and the conduct of its permitted activities. Further, the laws and regulations impose reporting and information collection obligations on the Bank. The Bank incurs significant costs relating to compliance with various laws and regulations and the collection and retention of information. As the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and banks continues to grow and become more complex, the cost of complying with regulatory requirements continues to increase. 
Financial and Bank Holding Company
We are a bank holding company and have registered as a financial holding company under regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. As a financial holding company, we may engage in certain business activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities as well as all activities authorized to bank holding companies generally. We may engage in authorized financial activities, provided that we remain a financial holding company and are “well capitalized” and “well managed.” We do not currently engage in significant financial holding company businesses or activities not otherwise permitted for bank holding companies generally.
Under federal law, we are required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank, which may include providing financial assistance to the Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress. Under existing Federal Reserve source of strength policies, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may also determine that the bank holding company is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to a subsidiary bank.
We are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than 5% of its voting stock. The Federal Reserve considers a number of factors in evaluating acquisitions including, but not limited to, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the convenience and needs of the communities served, and competitive factors. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, when considering an application, the Federal Reserve is also required to evaluate whether the transaction would result in more concentrated risks to the United States banking or financial system. Under federal law and regulations, a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state if, among other things, the bank holding company is both “well capitalized” and “well managed” both before and after the acquisition.
 5

Banks may also merge across state lines. With additional changes made to federal statutes under the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are also permitted to establish new interstate branches if a bank located in the target state could establish a new branch at the proposed location without regard to state laws limiting interstate de novo branching. A state can prohibit interstate mergers entirely or prohibit them if the continuing bank would control insured bank deposits in excess of a specified percentage of total insured bank deposits in the state. Under Montana law, a bank cannot acquire control of a bank located in Montana if, after the acquisition, the acquiring institution would control, in the aggregate, more than 22% of the total deposits of insured depository institutions located in Montana. As of June 30, 2018, based on publicly available information provided by the FDIC, the Bank controlled approximately 17.8% of the total deposits of all insured depository institutions located in Montana. The state limitation may limit our ability to directly or indirectly acquire additional banks located in Montana.
In order to assess the financial strength of the bank holding company, the Federal Reserve and the State of Montana may conduct periodic on-site and off-site inspections and credit reviews throughout the year. The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve, may require additional information and reports from us. In addition, the Federal Reserve may examine, and require reports and information regarding, any entity that we control, including entities other than banks or entities engaged in financial activities. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve may require us to divest of non-bank entities or limit the activities of those entities even if the activities are otherwise permitted to bank holding companies under governing law.

Dividends and Restrictions on Transfers of Funds

Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for the payment of our operating expenses and for the payment of dividends to our shareholders, and are limited by state and federal laws and regulations. The Company and the Bank are also subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to capital distributions, including dividends, regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized in the “Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action” section below. In general, the Bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained earnings from the two preceding calendar years unless the prior consent of the Federal Reserve is obtained. In addition, the Bank may not pay dividends in excess of the previous two years’ net earnings without providing notice to the Montana Division.
The capital buffer rules adopted by the federal banking regulators in accordance with the Basel Accords impose further limitations on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends. In general, the Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited under the capital buffer rules unless the Bank’s common equity conservation buffer exceeds the minimum required capital ratio by a specified amount which, when fully phased-in, will be 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
A state or federal banking regulator may impose, by regulatory order or agreement of the Bank, specific dividend limitations or prohibitions in certain circumstances. The Bank is not currently subject to a specific regulatory dividend limitation.
The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters (net of previous capital distributions) is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes under-capitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions.

Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies, which involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. The capital requirements are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments and are applied separately to the Bank and the Company.
Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings and is reduced by substantially all of the regulatory deductions including items such as goodwill and other intangibles and certain deferred tax assets. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions like us that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45.0% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements in individual cases where deemed necessary. The Federal Reserve has not established individual capital requirements applicable to us or the Bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act and the revised regulations limit the use of hybrid capital instruments in meeting regulatory capital requirements, including instruments similar to those which we currently have issued and outstanding. At this time, we meet the criteria for grandfathering under the Dodd-Frank Act, therefore, the limitations on use of hybrid capital instruments do not apply to our outstanding instruments. However, once the Company surpasses $15.0 billion in assets, we may lose Tier 1 qualification of trust preferred securities. 
 7

Federal law requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “under-capitalized,” “significantly under-capitalized” and “critically under-capitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio, the tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
A depository institution is generally prohibited from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be under-capitalized. Under-capitalized institutions may be subject to growth limitations and other restrictions and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly under-capitalized.”
“Significantly under-capitalized” depository institutions are subject to additional requirements and restrictions, such as orders to sell sufficient stock to become “adequately capitalized,” to reduce total assets, restrict interest rates paid, remove management and directors and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically under-capitalized” institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
The capital stock of banks organized under Montana law, such as the Bank, may be subject to assessment upon the direction of the Montana Department of Administration under the Montana Bank Act. Under the Montana Bank Act, if the Department of Administration determines an impairment of a bank’s capital exists, it may notify the bank’s board of directors of the impairment and require payment of an assessment on the bank stock. If the bank fails to do so, the Department of Administration may, among other things, take charge of the bank and proceed to liquidate the bank.
Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates, Directors and Officers
Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank may not lend funds or otherwise extend credit to us or any other affiliate, except on specified types and amounts of collateral generally upon market terms and conditions. The Federal Reserve also has authority to define and limit the transactions between banks and their affiliates. The Federal Reserve’s Regulation W and relevant federal statutes, among other things, impose significant limitations on transactions in which the Bank may engage with us or with other affiliates, including per affiliate and aggregate limits on affiliate transactions.
Federal Reserve Regulation O restricts loans to the Bank and Company insiders, which includes directors, certain officers and principal stockholders and their respective related interests. All extensions of credit to the insiders and their related interests must be on the same terms as, and subject to the same loan underwriting requirements as, loans to persons who are not insiders. In addition, Regulation O imposes lending limits on loans to insiders and their related interests and imposes, in certain circumstances, requirements for prior approval of the loans by the Bank board of directors.
Safety and Soundness Standards and Other Supervisory and Enforcement Mechanisms
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness, asset quality and earnings, internal controls and audit systems. These standards are designed to identify potential concerns and ensure action is taken to address those concerns before they pose a risk to the DIF. If a federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any of these standards, the agency may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the institution fails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to correct the deficiency and may take other supervisory action.
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators impose additional supervisory measures on banking organizations when they exceed $10 billion in assets. These include enhanced risk management and corporate governance processes and stress-testing requirements based on scenarios specified by the regulators.

The Federal Reserve has authority to bring enforcement action against a bank or bank holding company and all “institution-affiliated parties” of a bank or bank holding company, including directors, officers, stockholders, and under certain circumstances, attorneys, appraisers and accountants for the bank or holding company. Formal enforcement actions may include measures such as the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors or the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and can range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the Federal Reserve that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular bank. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. Montana law also provides the Montana Division with various enforcement mechanisms and, ultimately, authority to appoint a receiver or conservator for a Montana bank.
Deposit Insurance
The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 per depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from a statistical model estimating the probability of failure within a three-year period, with banks deemed more risky paying higher assessment.
The FDIC was required by the Dodd-Frank Act to take actions necessary to cause the DIF to reach a reserve ratio of 1.35% of total estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. Consequently, effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC revised its system to impose surcharges on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets and credit smaller institutions for any future payments toward reaching the 1.35% ratio. On September 30, 2018, the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reached 1.36 percent, exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent ahead of the September 30, 2020, deadline required under the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC regulations provide for two changes to deposit insurance assessments upon reaching the minimum: (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large banks) will cease; and (2) small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38 percent. 
All FDIC-insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or the FICO, an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.
Customer Privacy and Other Consumer Protections
Federal law imposes customer privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities, including the Bank and us. Under these requirements, a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information. In addition, for customers who obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal, family, or household purposes, a financial holding company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter. The financial company must also disclose its policies concerning the sharing of the customer’s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties. Finally, a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail marketing, or marketing through electronic mail.
The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and reporting obligations aimed at protecting consumers and Bank customers. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may, among other things, impair the collection of loans made in violation of the laws and regulations, provide borrowers or other customers certain rights and remedies or result in the imposition of penalties on the Bank. Certain of these laws and regulations are described below.
The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in credit transactions on, among other things, the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status or age and, in certain circumstances, limits the Bank’s ability to require co-obligors or guarantors as a condition of the extension of credit to an individual.
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”), requires certain disclosures be provided to borrowers in real estate loan closings or other real estate settlements. In addition, RESPA limits or prohibits certain settlement practices, fee sharing, kickbacks, and similar practices that are considered to be abusive.

The Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), requires disclosures to borrowers and other parties in consumer loans including, among other things, disclosures relating to interest rates and other finance charges, payments and payment schedules and annual percentage rates. TILA provides remedies to borrowers upon certain failures in compliance by a lender.
The Fair Housing Act regulates, among other things, lending practices in residential lending and prohibits discrimination in housing-related lending activities on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, disability, or familial status.
The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires certain lenders and other firms engaged in the home mortgage industry to collect and report information relating to applicants, borrowers and home mortgage lending activities in which they engage in their market areas or communities. The information is used for, among other purposes, evaluation of discrimination or other impermissible acts in home mortgage lending.
The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act regulates terms and disclosures of certain closed-end home mortgage loans that are not purchase money loans and includes loans classified as “high-cost loans.”
The Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, generally limits lenders and other financial firms in their collection, use or dissemination of customer credit information, gives customers some access to, and control over, their credit information and requires financial firms to establish policies and procedures intended to deter identity theft and related frauds.
The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act regulates actions that may be taken in the collection of consumer debts and provides consumers with certain rights of access to information related to collection actions.
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act regulates fees and other terms on electronic funds transactions.
The CFPB has promulgated numerous regulations relating to consumer financial services-related topics, such as mortgage origination disclosures, mortgage servicing practices, and others. 
The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be assessed for a violation of fair lending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and the CRA into account when evaluating applications for such transactions as mergers and new branches.
In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the appropriate bank regulatory agency assigns a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank received an “outstanding” rating on its most recent published examination. Although the Bank’s policies and procedures are designed to achieve compliance with all fair lending and CRA requirements, instances of non-compliance are occasionally identified through normal operational activities. Management endeavors to respond pro-actively to any instances of non-compliance and to implement and update appropriate procedures to prevent instances of non-compliance and other violations from occurring.
USA PATRIOT Act
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 and adopted additional measures requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The laws and related regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition or merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

Office of Foreign Asset Control 

The United States Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control enforces economic and trade sanctions imposed by the United States on foreign persons and governments. Among other authorities, the Office of Foreign Asset Control may require United States financial institutions to block or “freeze” assets of identified foreign persons or governments which come within the control of the financial institution. Financial institutions are required to adopt procedures for identification of new and existing deposit accounts and other relationships with persons or governments identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and to timely report the accounts or relationships to the Office of Foreign Asset Control.
Incentive Compensation 

In May 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published re-proposed rule-making designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as us. The proposed rule (i) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation (based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the FDIA) and (ii) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements for executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution. The proposed rule requires covered institutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices. The comment period ended in July 2016. Although final rules had not been adopted as of February 2019, if these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to the proposed rule-making, they will impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our executives.
Cyber-security 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cyber-security. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cyber-security attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cyber-security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cyber-security.
