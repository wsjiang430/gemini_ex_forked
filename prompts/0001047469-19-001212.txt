Item 1.    Business 
 Overview 
         We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics. Our lead product candidate is edasalonexent, formerly known as CAT-1004, an oral small molecule that inhibits NF-kB, or nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, in development for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD. We believe edasalonexent has the potential to be a foundational therapy for all patients affected by DMD regardless of the underlying dystrophin mutation. DMD is an ultimately fatal genetic disorder involving progressive muscle degeneration. The United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. The European Commission, or EC, has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. 
         We initiated a global Phase 3 trial of edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD in September 2018, which we refer to as the PolarisDMD trial. The PolarisDMD trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edasalonexent for registration purposes, with top-line results expected in the second quarter of 2020. Our goal is to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD in early 2021. PolarisDMD is currently enrolling patients with enrollment expected to be completed in 2019. The trial design was informed by discussions with the FDA, as well as input from treating physicians, families of boys affected by DMD and patient advocacy organizations. 
         The PolarisDMD trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and we anticipate enrolling approximately 125 patients between the ages of four and seven (up to eighth birthday), regardless of mutation type, who have not been on steroids for at least six months. The primary efficacy endpoint is change in North Star Ambulatory Assessment, or NSAA, score after 12 months of treatment with edasalonexent compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints are the age-appropriate timed function tests: time to stand, 4-stair climb and 10-meter walk/run. Assessments of growth, cardiac and bone health are also included in the trial. 
         This month, we are initiating a new open-label extension trial called the GalaxyDMD trial, in which we plan to enroll all of the boys currently participating in the MoveDMD open-label extension, and which will also provide the boys who complete the 12-month PolarisDMD trial with the opportunity to receive open-label edasalonexent treatment. The GalaxyDMD trial is designed to provide longer term safety data to support registration filings. 
         Our MoveDMD Phase 1/2 trial enrolled ambulatory boys four to seven years old with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DMD who were steroid naive or had not used steroids for at least six months prior to the trial. Boys enrolled in the trial were not limited to any specific dystrophin mutations and the 31 boys in the trial had 26 different dystrophin mutations. The MoveDMD trial was designed to be conducted in three sequential parts, Phase 1 and Phase 2, both of which are completed, and an open-label extension, which is on-going. In Phase 1 of the MoveDMD trial, we assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of edasalonexent in 17 patients, following seven days of dosing, and we reported in January 2016 that all three doses of edasalonexent tested were generally well tolerated with no safety signals observed and there were no serious adverse events and no drug discontinuations. In the Phase 2 portion of the trial, we assessed the effects of edasalonexent using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, T2 as an early biomarker at 12 weeks, and announced in January 2017 that the primary efficacy endpoint of average change from baseline to week 12 in the MRI T2 composite measure of lower leg muscles for the pooled edasalonexent treatment groups compared to placebo was not met, although we observed directionally positive results in the 100/mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment group that were not statistically significant. Subsequently, in the open-label extension of the 
 1

   MoveDMD trial, we observed statistically significant improvement in the rate of change in lower leg composite MRI T2 through 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks on 100 mg/kg of edasalonexent treatment compared to the off-treatment control period. 
         We have completed key efficacy and safety assessments from the MoveDMD trial. In the ongoing open-label extension of the MoveDMD trial through 72 weeks of oral 100 mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment, we observed preserved muscle function and consistent improvements in all four assessments of muscle function: NSAA score, time to stand, 4-stair climb and 10-meter walk/run, compared to the rates of change in the control period for boys prior to receiving edasalonexent treatment. Additionally, supportive changes in non-effort-based measures of muscle health were seen, supporting the durability of edasalonexent treatment effects. Specifically, we observed in the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group, that all four muscle enzymes tested (creatine kinase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly decreased compared to baseline following edasalonexent treatment at 12 weeks and later time points through 72 weeks (p<0.05). Through 72 weeks of treatment, edasalonexent continued to be well tolerated with no safety signals observed in the MoveDMD trial. Boys treated with edasalonexent continued to follow age-appropriate growth curves with age-appropriate increases in weight and height and overall body mass index trended down to age-normative values. We also observed that the heart rate of the boys significantly decreased toward age-normative values through over a year and a half period of edasalonexent treatment. 
         In addition to edasalonexent, we have developed CAT-5571 as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis, or CF. CAT-5571 is an oral small molecule that is designed to activate autophagy, a mechanism for recycling cellular components and digesting pathogens, which is important for host defenses and is depressed in CF. We have completed investigational new drug, or IND, application-enabling activities for CAT-5571. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we owned six issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to edasalonexent and four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims directed to CAT-5571. These patents are expected to expire between 2029 and 2030, without taking into account potential patent term extensions. In addition, our patent portfolio includes over 70 issued foreign patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, four pending international patent applications, and 17 pending foreign patent applications. 
   Our Product Candidates 
   Edasalonexent 
         We designed edasalonexent to inhibit NF-kB, a protein that is activated in DMD and that drives inflammation, fibrosis and muscle degeneration, and suppresses muscle regeneration. We have reported results from Phase 1, Phase 2 and the ongoing open-label extension of the MoveDMD trial through administration of edasalonexent for up to 72 weeks, as described further below under "Edasalonexent Clinical Development". The FDA has granted edasalonexent orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations for the treatment of DMD. The EC has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. 
   Overview of DMD 
         DMD is a rare pediatric disorder involving progressive muscle degeneration that eventually leads to death. DMD is caused by various mutations in the dystrophin gene that result in a lack of functional dystrophin in muscle fibers, which renders muscle fibers more susceptible to mechanical stress. Dystrophin is a protein that resides in the membrane of muscle cells and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, diaphragm, and cardiac muscle. When muscles contract or stretch during normal use, the absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in activation of the NF-kB pathway, triggering inflammation in the muscles, initiating muscle degeneration, and reducing 
 2

   the ability of muscles to regenerate. As muscle damage progresses, connective and adipose tissues replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable muscle weakness. 
         DMD occurs almost exclusively in males, occurring in approximately 1 in 3,500 live male births. Based on this incidence rate, we estimate that DMD affects a total of approximately 15,000 patients in the United States and approximately 19,000 patients in the European Union, or EU. 
         Children with DMD typically begin to show symptoms of disease between ages two and five, when they develop a waddling gait, frequently fall and have difficulty rising from the floor. Progressive weakness then develops in the voluntary muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. This muscle weakness is accompanied by fixations, or contractures, of joints, such as knees, hips and elbows. By age eight, most patients have difficulty ascending stairs. Patients typically lose walking ability between the ages of ten and fourteen and, by about twelve years of age, most people with DMD are unable to walk and need to use a power wheelchair on a regular basis. Patients' cardiac and respiratory muscles are also adversely affected, typically requiring use of ventilators in their late teens. Progressive weakening of cardiac and respiratory muscles of DMD patients eventually results in death, generally in the patient's mid-twenties. 
   The Role of NF-kB in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         NF-kB plays an important role in regulating skeletal muscle health and appears to be especially important in regulating skeletal muscle mass in chronic diseases such as DMD. NF-kB is a key link between loss of dystrophin and disease progression in DMD, and NF-kB has a fundamental role in skeletal and cardiac muscle disease in DMD. Activated NF-kB promotes the degradation of specific muscle proteins and leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNF-a, interleukin 6, or IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta, or IL-1b; chemokines; cell adhesion molecules; and tissue degrading enzymes, such as matrix metallopeptidase 9, or MMP-9. In addition, activated NF-kB suppresses muscle stem cell differentiation that is required for muscle regeneration by preventing satellite stem cells from differentiating into myoblasts, progenitor cells that differentiate, to give rise to muscle cells. Activation of NF-kB is observed in muscle tissues of patients with DMD prior to the onset of other clinical manifestations, and activated NF-kB is persistently elevated in the immune cells and regenerative muscle fibers of patients with DMD. Moreover, evidence exists that mechanical stress activates NF-kB in muscles and increases levels of activated NF-kB by a factor of three to four times. Muscles with increased mechanical stress, such as quadriceps and hamstrings, show the most rapid progression of disease. 
 Unaddressed Market Opportunity 
         There are currently only two therapies approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD: the Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., or Sarepta, drug EXONDYS 51®, also known as eteplirsen, an exon skipping therapy targeting the skipping of exon 51, that was granted accelerated approval by the FDA, and PTC Therapeutics' EMFLAZA®, also known as deflazacort, a glucocorticoid, which is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients five years of age and older. Corticosteroid therapy, including treatment with prednisone, is often prescribed to treat the inflammation underlying DMD and to delay loss of ambulation. In DMD patients, corticosteroids have demonstrated efficacy, which is believed to be driven by reductions in activated NF-kB. However, because corticosteroids primarily act through another pathway called the glucocorticoid receptor-mediated pathway, they can cause significant complications including growth suppression, excessive weight gain, behavioral changes, reduction in bone strength and compromise of the immune system. Over time, corticosteroids induce chronic myopathy in many diseases through induction of muscle protein breakdown, which ultimately leads to muscle damage. DMD patients treated with corticosteroids typically show an initial improvement in measures of muscle function but then resume a progressive decline. Approximately half of DMD patients treated with steroids lose the ability to walk by age thirteen and the vast majority are in 
 3

   wheelchairs by age sixteen. DMD patients typically live until their mid-twenties, despite the availability of corticosteroids. 
         In addition to the FDA-approved DMD therapies in the United States, there are several treatments for DMD that currently are being reviewed by the FDA or are approved or under review in the EU or are expected to be under review by regulatory agencies in the near future. For example, Sarepta announced in February 2019 that the rolling NDA for golodirsen, its phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer, or PMO, based, exon-53 skipping candidate, has been accepted by the FDA. Golodirsen has been granted priority review by the FDA and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date for a decision is August 19, 2019. Also, PTC Therapeutics' ataluren is conditionally approved in the EU and several other countries for treatment of nonsense mutation DMD, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older, under the trade name Translarna. In the third quarter of 2018, PTC Therapeutics filed in the EU for an extension of the existing label for Translarna to include non-ambulatory DMD patients. PTC Therapeutics is conducting additional clinical trials with ataluren in nmDMD in the United States and is in discussions with the FDA as to the regulatory approval pathway. 
         EXONDYS 51, golodirsen and ataluren target mechanisms to increase levels of dystrophin in muscles. Each of these agents addresses a specific type of genetic mutation in order to produce a partially functional dystrophin protein. The therapeutic goal of these product candidates is to reduce disease severity and extend survival in those DMD patients who are candidates for therapy with these agents. Based on the prevalence of the specific mutations that EXONDYS 51, golodirsen and ataluren are designed to address, they would be expected to be effective in an aggregate of approximately 34% of DMD patients. We believe that DMD patients, including those treated with these dystrophin-targeted therapies, will continue to require treatments to reduce muscle inflammation and degeneration and enhance muscle regeneration. 
   Edasalonexent for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         Based on the mechanism of action by which edasalonexent suppresses NF-kB and the results that we have seen in preclinical models of DMD, we believe that edasalonexent has the potential to combine reduction of inflammation and muscle degeneration with positive effects on muscle regeneration, all of which may allow patients to retain muscle function longer. In addition, we believe that edasalonexent has the potential to be an effective therapy in all DMD patients, regardless of the underlying mutation, and to provide significant benefit to patients, both as monotherapy and when used in combination with other therapies, including dystrophin-targeted therapies. If we receive marketing approval, we intend to commercialize edasalonexent in North America ourselves and commercialize edasalonexent outside of North America either ourselves or with a collaborator. 
 Edasalonexent Clinical Development 
 


PolarisDMD Phase 3 Trial of Edasalonexent in Patients with DMD 

         We initiated a global Phase 3 trial for the treatment of DMD in September 2018, which we refer to as the PolarisDMD trial. The PolarisDMD trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edasalonexent for registration purposes, with top-line results expected in the second quarter of 2020. PolarisDMD is currently enrolling patients with sites open for enrollment in the United States, Canada and Australia. Additional PolarisDMD clinical trial sites are expected to open in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe and Israel in the next few months. In total, the PolarisDMD trial is expected to include approximately 40 clinical trial sites globally with enrollment expected to be completed in 2019. The trial design was informed by discussions with the FDA, as well as input from treating physicians, families of boys affected by DMD and patient advocacy organizations. 
 4

           The PolarisDMD trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and we anticipate enrolling approximately 125 patients between the ages of four and seven (up to eighth birthday), regardless of mutation type, who have not been on steroids for at least six months. Boys may be eligible to enroll in the trial if they are on a stable dose of EXONDYS 51, one of two therapies approved for the treatment of DMD in the United States. The primary efficacy endpoint is change in NSAA score after 12 months of treatment with edasalonexent compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints are the age-appropriate timed function tests: time to stand, 4-stair climb and 10-meter walk/run. Assessments of growth, cardiac and bone health are also included. Enrolled boys are being randomized in a 2:1 ratio with two boys receiving edasalonexent for every boy that receives placebo, and we expect that after the initial 12-month treatment period all boys will be offered the opportunity to receive edasalonexent in an open-label extension. 
   MoveDMD Phase 1/2 Trial of Edasalonexent in Patients with DMD 
         Our MoveDMD Phase 1/2 trial enrolled 31 ambulatory boys four to seven years old with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DMD who were steroid naive or had not used steroids for at least six months prior to the trial. Boys enrolled in the trial were not limited to any specific dystrophin mutations and the boys in the trial had 26 different dystrophin mutations. The MoveDMD trial was designed to be conducted in three sequential parts, Phase 1 and Phase 2, both of which are completed, and an open-label extension, which is on-going. In Phase 1 of the MoveDMD trial, we assessed the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of edasalonexent in 17 patients, following seven days of dosing, and we reported in January 2016 that all three doses of edasalonexent tested were generally well tolerated with no safety signals observed and there were no serious adverse events and no drug discontinuations. In the Phase 2 portion of the trial, we assessed the effects of edasalonexent using MRI T2 as an early biomarker at 12 weeks, and announced in January 2017 that the primary efficacy endpoint of average change from baseline to week 12 in the MRI T2 composite measure of lower leg muscles for the pooled edasalonexent treatment groups compared to placebo was not met, although we observed directionally positive results in the 100/mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment group that were not statistically significant and subsequently observed positive MRI T2 results in the open-label extension of the MoveDMD trial described further below. 
         We have completed key efficacy and safety assessments from the MoveDMD trial. In the open-label extension of the MoveDMD trial through 72 weeks of oral 100 mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment, we reported in October 2018 that we have observed preserved muscle function and consistent improvements in all four assessments of muscle function: NSAA score, time to stand, 4-stair climb and 10-meter walk/run, compared to the rates of change in the control period for boys prior to receiving edasalonexent treatment. Additionally, supportive changes in non-effort-based measures of muscle health were seen, supporting the durability of edasalonexent treatment effects. Specifically, we observed statistically significant improvement in the rate of change in lower leg composite MRI T2 through 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks on 100 mg/kg of edasalonexent treatment compared to the off-treatment control period. MRI T2 is closely associated with functional outcomes in DMD supported by data from ImagingDMD, the largest natural history database of MRI assessments in boys with DMD. 
         The relative proportion of fat in muscle, which is referred to as fat fraction and is correlated with functional ability, can also be determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or MRS. Improvements in the MRS fat fraction rate of change through 48 weeks of edasalonexent treatment compared to the off-treatment control period were observed in both soleus and vastus lateralis leg muscles, which are strongly correlated with ambulatory function. 
         Additional supportive measures of muscle health also reinforce the positive edasalonexent treatment effects observed in the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group. All four muscle enzymes tested (creatine kinase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase) were 
 5

   significantly decreased compared to baseline following edasalonexent treatment at 12 weeks and later time points through 72 weeks (p<0.05), consistent with a positive impact on muscle health and supportive of a positive impact from treatment with edasalonexent. Biomarker results showed that C-reactive protein, or CRP, was significantly decreased with edasalonexent at 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks compared to baseline in the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group (p<0.001). CRP is a well-characterized blood test marker that provides a global assessment of inflammation and is elevated in boys affected by DMD. The significant decrease observed in CRP supports a conclusion that the biological activity of edasalonexent in inhibiting NF-kB can decrease inflammation. 
         Edasalonexent was well tolerated in the MoveDMD trial with no clinical safety signals observed to date through 2 years of treatment. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, have been mild in nature with no serious AEs. The most common treatment-related AEs were gastrointestinal, primarily mild and transient diarrhea and, in Phase 2, vomiting. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, no drug discontinuations and no dose reductions. Boys treated with edasalonexent grew an average of 2.1 inches taller per year and gained 2.9 pounds per year, and their overall body mass index decreased from 70th percentile of unaffected boys to the 55th percentile over 72 weeks of treatment, approaching the average body mass index for unaffected boys. 
         Additionally, boys with DMD in the age range enrolled in the trial typically have resting tachycardia, a heart rate that exceeds the normal resting rate, and we observed that the heart rate of the boys treated with edasalonexent significantly decreased toward age-normative values over a year and a half period of edasalonexent treatment. 
         In the MoveDMD trial, two boys received edasalonexent and eteplirsen for an average of 1 year. The combination was well tolerated with no safety signals. Edasalonexent has previously been shown to increase dystrophin expression in combination with exon-skipping therapy in mdx mice, supporting the potential of edasalonexent to enhance dystrophin-targeted therapies such as eteplirsen and other therapies in development. 
   Edasalonexent Research Collaborations 
         In November 2018, we announced a collaboration with University of Texas Southwestern, or UT Southwestern, to explore the potential of edasalonexent to improve cardiac function in DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy, or BMD. This is a one-year preclinical collaboration with Pradeep Mammen, MD, FACC, FAHA, founder and Medical Director of the Neuromuscular Cardiomyopathy Clinic at UT Southwestern Medical Center as well as Co-Director of the National Institute of Health Sponsored UT Southwestern Senator Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of mortality in DMD and BMD. Preclinical and clinical data support the potential for cardiac benefits with edasalonexent in DMD and BMD. 
         In September 2016, we announced a pre-clinical joint research collaboration with Sarepta to explore a combination drug treatment approach for DMD. In the collaboration, increased dystrophin protein expression was seen with an exon-skip modality in combination with edasalonexent in a mouse model of DMD. 
   Edasalonexent Orphan Drug, Fast Track and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations 
         The FDA has granted edasalonexent orphan drug, fast track and rare pediatric disease designations for the treatment of DMD. A product may be designated by the FDA as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the FDA will not approve another sponsor's marketing application for the same product for the same use or indication before the expiration of seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. The FDA fast track process is designed to expedite the 
 6

   development and review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Companies that receive fast track designation are allowed to submit NDAs on a rolling basis, expediting the FDA review process, and benefit from more frequent communication with the FDA to discuss all aspects of clinical development. In addition, drugs that receive fast track designation are eligible for accelerated approval and priority review if certain criteria are met. The FDA's rare pediatric disease designation gives us the potential to receive a priority review voucher if edasalonexent is approved. However, the rare pediatric disease program is set to expire in September 2020. 
         The EC has granted orphan medicinal product designation to edasalonexent for the treatment of DMD. Similar to the FDA orphan drug designation, the EC may designate a product as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons. In Europe, marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product generally leads to up to a ten-year period of market exclusivity if the product candidate is granted marketing authorization in the EU. 
   Edasalonexent Expansion Indication Opportunities 
         In addition to our work in DMD, we are evaluating other diseases where the inhibition of NF-kB may be beneficial for further therapeutic applications of edasalonexent. There are a number of other rare diseases where NF-kB is believed to play an important role, such as BMD, which is a type of muscular dystrophy and is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis. 
   CAT-5571 
         CAT-5571 is a conjugate that contains cysteamine, a naturally occurring molecule that is a degradation product of the amino acid cysteine, and DHA, based on our proprietary Safely Metabolized And Rationally Targeted linker, or SMART Linker, drug discovery platform. We are developing CAT-5571 as a potential oral treatment for CF. CAT-5571 is a small molecule that is designed to activate autophagy, a mechanism for recycling cellular components and digesting pathogens, which is important for host defenses and is depressed in CF. We have completed IND application-enabling activities for CAT-5571. We intend to further develop our CAT-5571 program through selective collaborations with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. 
   Cystic Fibrosis 
         CF is a rare, chronic, genetic, life-shortening orphan disease that affects over 70,000 patients worldwide, predominantly in the Caucasian population. In CF, a malfunctioning cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ion channel impairs chloride secretion, with deleterious effects on multiple organs, and particularly devastating effects on pulmonary, intestinal and pancreatic function. Patients affected with CF are also predisposed to respiratory failure caused by persistent lung infections, notably bacteria and most commonly P. aeruginosa, that are difficult to treat with standard antibiotics. CF patients have frequent pulmonary exacerbations due to their inability to clear the persistent lung infections. Advancement in research and treatments have extended the life expectancy for those living with CF, however, there is currently no cure. 
 Sales and Marketing 
         Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any collaboration or co-promotion arrangements. If we are able to progress our edasalonexent program, we intend to commercialize edasalonexent in North America ourselves and commercialize edasalonexent outside of North America either ourselves or with a collaborator.

     Manufacturing and Supply 
         Our product candidates are small molecule compounds manufactured from component raw materials. The omega-3 fatty acid materials that we use as bioactives are purified from natural sources by established pharmaceutical fine chemicals manufacturers. The other bioactive and linker raw materials that we use are also readily available from established pharmaceutical intermediate manufacturers. The components are conjugated to form the SMART Linker product candidate using well understood, conventional chemistries. 
         We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substance and drug product required for our clinical trials. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaborators to manufacture commercial quantities of our products, if approved. 
   Competition 
         The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. If we successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates, we and any future collaborators will face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of the entities developing and marketing potentially competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. 
         The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
   Edasalonexent for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy 
         There are currently only two therapies approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD. Sarepta's drug EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of DMD under the accelerated approval pathway in September 2016 for patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. In addition, in February 2017, the FDA granted approval of PTC Therapeutics' drug EMFLAZA, for the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older. PTC Therapeutics has subsequently submitted an sNDA to expand the EMFLAZA label to include two-to-five year old DMD patients in the United States and has stated that it expects a response from the FDA in 2019. Outside of the United States, PTC Therapeutics' drug ataluren, also known as Translarna, has been conditionally approved within the EU Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Israel and South Korea for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. PTC Therapeutics is also currently running confirmatory Phase 2/3 clinical trials with ataluren in nmDMD in the United States and has stated that it plans to re-submit an NDA to FDA pending the outcomes of these trials. Although not previously approved for the treatment of DMD, corticosteroid therapy, including prednisone, is considered standard of care and is often prescribed to treat the inflammation underlying DMD and to delay loss of ambulation. 
         A number of companies are developing therapies to treat DMD in patients with specific mutations in the dystrophin gene. In addition to EXONDYS 51, Sarepta has two additional exon-skipping therapies for DMD in Phase 3 clinical development. These agents, golodirsen (SRP-4053) and casimersen (SRP-4045), target skipping of exons 53 and 45, respectively. Sarepta has submitted a rolling NDA to the FDA for golodirsen with an August 19, 2019 PDUFA date. Daiichi-Sankyo is developing an exon-skipping product candidate for DMD patients with out-of-frame deletion mutations amenable 
 8

   to exon 45 skipping and announced in February 2016 that it began its first Phase 1/2 clinical trial for its product candidate, DS-5141b, in Japan. NS Pharma has a compound, NS-065/NCNP-01, in Phase 2 clinical development in the United States and Japan for patients with mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. NS-065/NCNP-01 received orphan drug designation in the United States and was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. Based on the prevalence of the specific mutations that these product candidates being developed by Sarepta, Daiichi-Sankyo and NS-Pharma are designed to address, they would be expected to have the potential to be effective in an aggregate of approximately 16% of DMD patients. In addition, Wave Life Sciences Ltd., or Wave, initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in DMD in November 2017 for its exon 51 skipping candidate, suvodirsen (WVE-210201). Wave has stated that it plans to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial in DMD with suvodirsen in 2019. 
         In addition to exon-skipping therapies, other companies have alternative therapeutic approaches to the treatment of DMD in late stage clinical development. Other alternative therapeutic approaches in later stage clinical trials include Italfarmaco S.p.A.'s Phase 3 trial in ambulant DMD boys for givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., or Roche, has a myostatin inhibitor in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for DMD. Additionally, ReveraGen is testing vamololone, a putative dissociative steroid, in a Phase 2b clinical trial. Mallinckrodt is also running a large Phase 2 trial in DMD boys aged four to eight years old for cosyntropin, or MNK-1411, and Santhera has announced that it plans to re-submit marketing authorization applications for idebenone for the treatment of DMD in patients with respiratory function decline and not taking concomitant glucocorticoids to EMA and the FDA in 2019. A number of companies also have products candidates in earlier clinical development for DMD, including Akashi Therapeutics, Astellas, Capricor Therapeutics, Cardero Therapeutics, EspeRare, Fibrogen, Phrixus Pharmaceuticals, and Taiho Pharmaceuticals. If successfully developed, some of these alternative therapeutic approaches may be applicable to all DMD patients regardless of underlying mutation status. Additionally, several gene therapy programs targeting the dystrophin gene have entered clinical development, including Solid Biosciences SGT-001, Pfizer's PF-06939926, and Sarepta's GALGT2 and micro-dystrophin programs being conducted in collaboration with Nationwide Children's Hospital. 
   Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including pursuing and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including certain aspects of our SMART Linker drug discovery platform. 
         Our commercial success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technologies, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, in particular, our patent rights, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. 
         The patent positions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and can involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted and even challenged after issuance. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protected or remain protectable by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
         As of December 31, 2018, our patent estate included over 10 issued U.S. patents, over 70 issued foreign patents, over three pending U.S. patent applications, four pending international patent applications, and 17 pending foreign patent applications.

        With regard to edasalonexent, we have six issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims covering edasalonexent and its use. The issued U.S. patents are expected to expire in 2029, without taking a potential patent term extension into account. In addition, we have patents that have been granted in various countries and regions including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico and New Zealand, which are expected to expire in 2029, without taking potential patent term extensions into account, and at least five pending patent applications in various other countries in North and South America, which, if issued, are expected to expire in 2029, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. 
         With regard to CAT-5571, we have four issued U.S. patents with composition of matter and method of use claims covering CAT-5571 and its use, which are scheduled to expire in 2030, without taking potential patent term extensions into account. We also have 10 patent applications pending in the United States and in other regions including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia, with claims covering CAT-5571 and related compounds and their use, including their use in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. 
         The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. 
         In the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering edasalonexent and CAT-5571, may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 
         In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary information that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including, for example, certain aspects of our manufacturing processes and conjugate selection methodologies. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or similar proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our proprietary information. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. 
   Government Regulation and Product Approvals 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, sales, reimbursement, distribution, pricing, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along 
 10

   with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities, including state agencies. 
         An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:
 

 completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's good laboratory practice, or
GLP, regulations; 
 submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; 
 approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety
and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof,
are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's
identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and 
 compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies
required by the FDA. 

 Preclinical Studies 
         Before an applicant begins testing a product candidate with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, 
 11

   analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity assessments, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
         Companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the candidate product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted, to demonstrate that the candidate product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
   The IND and IRB Processes 
         An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a partial or full clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. 
         Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. Clinical holds are imposed by the FDA whenever there is concern for patient safety and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, nonclinical, and/or chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed. 
         A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical study under an IND. When a foreign clinical study is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When the foreign clinical study is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with FDA certain regulatory requirements in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval. Specifically, on April 28, 2008, the FDA amended its regulations governing the acceptance of foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application as support for an IND or a new drug application. The final rule provides that such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an 
 12

   independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The GCP requirements in the final rule encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical studies. The FDA's regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical studies, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign studies are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for IND studies. 
         In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
         Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study. Suspension or termination of development during any phase of clinical trials can occur if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Other reasons for suspension or termination may be made by us based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate. 
         Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. 
   Expanded Access to an Investigational Drug for Treatment Use 
         Expanded access, sometimes called "compassionate use," is the use of investigational new drug products outside of clinical trials to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. The rules and regulations related to expanded access are intended to improve access to investigational drugs for patients who may benefit from investigational therapies. FDA regulations allow access to investigational drugs under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes on a case-by-case basis for: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the drug under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. 
         When considering an IND application for expanded access to an investigational product with the purpose of treating a patient or a group of patients, the sponsor and treating physicians or investigators will determine suitability when all of the following criteria apply: patient(s) have a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition, and there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or treat the disease or condition; the potential patient benefit justifies the potential risks of the treatment and the potential risks are not unreasonable in the context or condition to be treated; and the expanded use of the investigational drug for the requested treatment will not interfere initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the product or otherwise compromise the potential development of the product. 
         On December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act established (and the 2017 Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act, or FDARA, later amended) a requirement that drug and biologic companies that sponsor one or more investigational drugs for the treatment of a serious disease(s) or condition(s) make publicly available their policy for evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access for individual patients. Although these requirements were rolled out over time, they have now come into full effect. Sponsors are required to make such policies publicly available upon the earlier of 
 13

   initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 study; or 15 days after the drug or biologic receives designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative medicine advanced therapy. 
         In addition, on May 30, 2018 the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy. 
   Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 Phase 1.  The drug is
initially introduced into healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption,
metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. 
 Phase 2.  The drug is
administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to
determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 Phase 3.  The drug is
administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the
efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 
 Phase 4.  Post-approval
studies, which are conducted following initial approval, are typically conducted to gain additional experience and data from treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. 

         Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has 
 14

   been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
         Concurrent with clinical trials, companies often complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted, to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
         Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA's internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
         For drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, the FDA must, upon the request of an applicant, meet to discuss preparation of the initial pediatric study plan or to discuss deferral or waiver of pediatric assessments. In addition, FDA will meet early in the development process to discuss pediatric study plans with sponsors and FDA must meet with sponsors by no later than the end-of-phase 1 meeting for serious or life-threatening diseases and by no later than ninety (90) days after FDA's receipt of the study plan. 
         The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
         FDARA established new requirements to govern certain molecularly targeted cancer indications. Any company that submits an NDA three years after the date of enactment of that statute must submit pediatric assessments with the NDA if the drug is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer. The investigation must be designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data regarding the dosing, safety and preliminary efficacy to inform pediatric labeling for the product. 
   Submission of an NDA to the FDA 
         Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, which for federal fiscal year 2019 is $2,588,478 for an application requiring clinical data. The sponsor of an approved NDA is 
 15

   also subject to an annual program fee, which for fiscal year 2019 is $309,915. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses. 
         The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA's receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for "priority review" products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
         Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites involved with the conduct of the Phase 3 clinical trials to assure compliance with GCP. If compliance or data integrity is called into question due to inspection finding, this may cause a delay or affect the likelihood of drug approval. Under the FDARA, the FDA must implement a protocol to expedite review of responses to inspection reports pertaining to certain applications, including applications for products in shortage or those for which approval is dependent on remediation of conditions identified in the inspection report. 
         In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 
         The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 16

          
  Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Regenerative Advanced Therapy Designations 
         The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation and regenerative advanced therapy designation. 
         Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product's application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
         Second, a product may be designated as a Breakthrough Therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to Breakthrough Therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
         Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed product represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA's goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. 
         Finally, with passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, in December 2016, Congress authorized the FDA to accelerate review and approval of products designated as regenerative advanced therapies. A product is eligible for this designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of a regenerative advanced therapy designation include early interactions with FDA to expedite development and review, benefits available to breakthrough therapies, potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. 
 17

     Accelerated Approval Pathway 
         The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
         For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. There is limited experience with accelerated approvals by the FDA based on intermediate clinical endpoints. However, the FDA has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
         The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor's agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug's clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
   The FDA's Decision on an NDA 
         On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA may issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the 
 18

   application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The FDA, and other foreign regulatory agencies, have substantial discretion in the approval process. 
         If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug's safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
   Post-Approval Requirements 
         Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
         In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

 19

           The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug's safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product's prescribing information. In the United States, health care professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such uses not described in the drug's labeling, known as off-label uses, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers' communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. 
         If a company is found to have promoted off-label uses, it may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. 
         In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the regulation of distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
   Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
         In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
         Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is "bioequivalent" to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to an RLD if "the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug..." 
         Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is "therapeutically equivalent" to the RLD in its publication "Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations," also referred to as the "Orange Book." Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA's designation of therapeutic equivalence often 
 20

   results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
         Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. 
         The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three-year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five-year NCE exclusivity, an award of three-year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product. The FDA typically makes decisions about awards of data exclusivity shortly before a product is approved. 
         The FDA must establish a priority review track for certain generic drugs, requiring the FDA to review a drug application within eight (8) months for a drug that has three (3) or fewer approved drugs listed in the Orange Book and is no longer protected by any patent or regulatory exclusivities, or is on the FDA's drug shortage list. The new legislation also authorizes FDA to expedite review of "competitor generic therapies" or drugs with inadequate generic competition, including holding meetings with or providing advice to the drug sponsor prior to submission of the application. 
   Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 
         Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 
         Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:
 

 the required patent information has not been filed; 
 the listed patent has expired; 
 the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or 
 the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. 

         A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product's listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant 
 21

   does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 
         If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
         To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
   Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
         Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA's request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
         Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an "orphan drug" if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must seek orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the candidate product. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
         If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug 
 22

   exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor's marketing application for the same drug for the same condition for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different product for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same product for different conditions. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
         Orphan drug exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. This is the case despite an earlier court opinion holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously required the FDA to recognize orphan exclusivity regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. 
   Patent Term Restoration and Extension 
         A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. ql 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program 
         With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the law. This provision is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a "rare pediatric disease" may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. 
         For the purposes of this program, a "rare pediatric disease" is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare disease or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. A sponsor may choose to request rare pediatric disease designation, but the designation process is entirely voluntary; requesting designation is not a prerequisite to requesting or receiving a priority review voucher. In addition, sponsors who choose not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a priority review voucher if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. Under the Cures Act, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized until 2020. However, if a drug is designated before October 1, 2020, it is eligible to receive a voucher if approved before October 2022.

  Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
   Clinical Trial Approval 
         The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States govern the system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under this system, an applicant must obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The clinical trial application must be accompanied by, among other documents, an investigational medicinal product dossier (the Common Technical Document) with supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2005/28/EC, where relevant the implementing national provisions of the individual EU Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 
         In April 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted. The Regulation was published on June 16, 2014 but is not expected to apply until later in 2019. The Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable in all the EU Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and replacing any national legislation that was put in place to implement the Directive. Conduct of all clinical trials performed in the EU will continue to be bound by currently applicable provisions until the new Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable. The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation will depend on when the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation becomes applicable the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. 
         The new Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, the "EU Portal and Database"; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting Member State, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 24

           As in the United States, similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are present in the European Union website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/ and other countries. 
   PRIME Designation in the EU 
         In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) or Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA's Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. 
   Procedures Governing Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 
         To obtain marketing approval of a product under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the EC that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 
         Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
         The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of 
 25

   receiving the reference member state's assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 
         If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding on all member states. 
   Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union 
         In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator's data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 
         In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
   Periods of Authorization and Renewals 
         Marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the EC or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European Union market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause). 
 26

     Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
         Regulation 141/2000 provides that a drug shall be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish: that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Community when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Community would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Community or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 
         Regulation 847/2000 sets out criteria and procedures governing designation of orphan drugs in the European Union. Specifically, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of "clinically relevant superiority" by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant to Regulation 141/2000 shall be eligible for incentives made available by the European Community and by the member states to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs. 
   Pricing Decisions for Approved Products 
         In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Member States may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various Member States, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries.

     Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom 
         On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the EU of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU will take effect either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or, in the absence of agreement, two years after the United Kingdom provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the EU Treaty. Since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the United Kingdom covering quality, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the United Kingdom. It remains to be seen how, if at all, Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the United Kingdom. 
         The United Kingdom has a period of a maximum of two years from the date of its formal notification to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal from, and future relationship with, the EU. If no formal withdrawal agreement is reached between the United Kingdom and the EU, then it is expected the United Kingdom's membership of the EU will automatically terminate two years after the submission of the notification of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the EU. Discussions between the United Kingdom and the EU focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the UK Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the United Kingdom leaving the EU on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. 
   General Data Protection Regulation 
         The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require companies to change their business practices to ensure full compliance. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
         Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or 
 28

   reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
         In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 
         The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. 
         Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our product candidates will face challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. 
         In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

  Healthcare Law and Regulation 
         Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:


 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering,
receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or
service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
 the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit
individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false
statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 
 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among
other things, knowingly and willingly executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which also
imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper
payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment; 
 the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making
any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education
Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services
information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and 
 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or
services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

         Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

     Healthcare Reform 
         A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
         In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for drug products under government health care programs. The Affordable Care Act:
 

 expanded manufacturers' rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic
drugs and revising the definition of "average manufacturer price," or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices; 
 addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are
inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; 
 expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; and 
 established the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program by requiring manufacturers to provide a 50% point-of-sale-discount off the
negotiated price of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. 

         Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
         These healthcare reforms, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price for any approved product and/or the level of reimbursement physicians receive for administering any approved product. Reductions in reimbursement levels may negatively impact the prices or the frequency with which products are prescribed or administered. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. 
         Since enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which was signed by the President on December 22, 2017, Congress repealed the "individual mandate." The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, will become effective in 2019. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the repeal of the individual mandate will cause 13 million fewer Americans to be insured in 2027 and 
 31

   premiums in insurance markets may rise. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called "Cadillac" tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the "donut hole." 
         The Trump Administration has also taken executive actions to undermine or delay implementation of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. One Executive Order directs federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. The second Executive Order terminates the cost-sharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the ACA. Several state Attorneys General filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies, but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in California on October 25, 2017. In addition, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces. Further, on June 14, 2018, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors who argued were owed to them. The effects of this gap in reimbursement on third-party payors, the viability of the ACA marketplace, providers, and potentially our business, are not yet known. 
         Further, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed federal and proposed and enacted state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. 
         For example, on May 11, 2018, the Administration issued a plan to lower drug prices. Under this blueprint for action, the Administration indicated that the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will: take steps to end the gaming of regulatory and patent processes by drug makers to unfairly protect monopolies; advance biosimilars and generics to boost price competition; evaluate the inclusion of prices in drug makers' ads to enhance price competition; speed access to and lower the cost of new drugs by clarifying policies for sharing information between insurers and drug makers; avoid excessive pricing by relying more on value-based pricing by expanding outcome-based payments in Medicare and Medicaid; work to give Part D plan sponsors more negotiation power with drug makers; examine which Medicare Part B drugs could be negotiated for a lower price by Part D plans, and improving the design of the Part B Competitive Acquisition Program; update Medicare's drug-pricing dashboard to increase transparency; prohibit Part D contracts that include "gag rules" that 
 32

   prevent pharmacists from informing patients when they could pay less out-of-pocket by not using insurance; and require that Part D plan members be provided with an annual statement of plan payments, out-of-pocket spending, and drug price increases. More recently, on January 31, 2019, the HHS Office of Inspector General proposed modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute discount safe harbor for the purpose of reducing the cost of drug products to consumers which, among other things, if finalized, will affect discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, Medicaid managed care organizations and pharmacy benefit managers working with these organizations. 
         At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
