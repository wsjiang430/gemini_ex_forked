ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated ("Company", "we" or "our") is a leading provider of high quality, trusted, local news and information, and a major platform for advertising in the markets we serve. We operate 50 principally mid-sized local media operations (including TNI Partners ("TNI") and Madison Newspapers, Inc. ("MNI")) across 20 states.
 
Our products include print and digital editions of daily, weekly and monthly newspapers and niche publications. All of our products offer print and digital editions, and our content and advertising is available in real time through our websites and mobile apps. We provide marketing services, predominately through our digital marketing agency, Amplified Agency, and through one of our subsidiaries, TownNews, we provide web hosting and content management services for our media operations and 2,000 other content producers who rely on TownNews for their web, Over-the-top display ("OTT"), mobile, video and social media products.
 
Our local media operations range from large daily newspapers and the associated digital products, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to non-daily newspapers with news websites and digital platforms serving smaller communities.
 
As the leading provider of local news, information and a major source of advertising in our markets we aim to grow our business through three main categories: subscriptions with consumers, local retail accounts and digital services.
 

• | We are committed to a business strategy that drives audience growth and engagement by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information to consumers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Local, controllable retail accounts - those in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers - are the core of our business. This segment represents more than 50% of advertising revenue and we believe we can improve revenue trends in this category as we have unmatched audience reach through our print and digital product offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | TownNews represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue by providing state-of-the-art web hosting and content management services to nearly 2,000 other media organizations including broadcast.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our local media operations generate revenue primarily through print and digital advertising, digital marketing services, subscriptions to our publications and digital services, primarily through TownNews. Our operations also provide commercial printing, distribution of third party publications and management services to other local media operations.
 
Advertising and Marketing Services - Approximately 52% of our 2019 revenue was derived from advertising and marketing services. The following broadly define major categories of advertising and marketing services revenue:

Local retail advertising is revenue earned from top local accounts and Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs) in our markets and takes the form of display advertising in daily and non-daily publications, from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, and display advertising delivered on our owned and operated websites.
 
Classified advertising includes major categories of employment, real estate, automotive, obituaries and legal notices. Advertising for classifieds is published in both the print and digital editions of our products and is also posted on our websites and mobile applications.
 
National advertising is revenue earned from the sale of print or digital display advertising space, or from preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, from national accounts that do not have a local retailer representing the account in the market.
 
Niche publications are specialty publications, such as lifestyle, business, health or home improvement publications that contain advertising.
 
Marketing services represents a complete suite of services including events, contests and digital promotions offered in our local markets through Amplified Agency.
 
 1



Our sales force uses a multi-platform sales approach that maximizes audience reach for our advertisers by tailoring advertising and marketing services packages based on the size and scale of the advertiser. Through Amplified Agency we create sophisticated digital campaigns on our owned and operated sites and on third party inventory that give advertisers the ability to target their message. We partner with Google to provide key metrics and analytics to measure campaign effectiveness. 
 
Our advertising revenues are subject to seasonality due primarily to fluctuations in advertising spend. Advertising revenue is typically highest in our first quarter due to holiday and seasonal advertising and lowest in the second quarter following the holiday season. The volume of advertising sales in any period is also impacted by other external factors such as competitors' pricing, advertisers' decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand, and general economic conditions.
 
Subscription Revenue - Approximately 37% of our 2019 revenue was derived from subscriptions to our print and digital products. Subscription revenue is earned primarily from our News+ membership platform, which offers different rewards, benefits and access to content through five different membership levels. Three levels include full access, where members receive print and digital access to our leading local news, information and advertising content, and two levels include digital-only access. We also earn subscription revenue from the sale of single copy editions.
 
We reach 77% of all adults in our larger markets through a combination of our print and digital content offerings.
 

• | Our printed newspapers reach almost 700,000 households daily and more than 1 million on Sunday, and more than 265,000 users access our digital e-edition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our web and mobile sites are the number one digital source of local news in most of our markets, reaching more than 29.3 million unique visitors each month with a monthly average of 286.9 million page views. Page views per session, one metric we use to monitor engagement, increased 10.2% in 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of September 29, 2019, we have 91,000 digital only subscribers, a 79.1% increase over 2018. News+ full access members also have access to, and use, our digital content.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Digital Services Revenue – Approximately 4% of our revenue is derived from digital services, most of which is revenue from TownNews. TownNews, operated through our 82.5% owned subsidiary INN Partners, L.C., is a leading provider of integrated digital publishing and content management solutions, and offers a state-of-the-art platform for creating, distributing and monetizing multimedia content.
 

• | TownNews is the engine that powers our digital products. In addition to us, TownNews services nearly 2,000 daily and weekly newspapers as well as universities, television stations and niche publications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Including revenue generated from our markets, total revenue at TownNews grew almost 20% in 2019 and totaled $22.6 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | With strong product offerings, investments in video and streaming technology and a diversifying customer base into broadcast, TownNews is positioned to continue to be a key component to our growth strategy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Other Revenue - Other revenue, excluding digital services revenue, is comprised mainly of revenue from our management agreement with BH Media Group, Inc (“BHMG”), commercial printing and delivery of third party products. Other revenue represents 7% of our business.
 
Our operating costs are primarily compensation, newsprint, delivery and digital costs. Over the past several years we have adjusted our business model to create operational efficiencies and significantly reduce our cost structure.
 
We have centralized, or regionalized, most back office functions including the design of our newspapers. The regional design centers ("RDCs") have enabled us to more cost effectively design and layout the newspaper. The RDCs - combined with a common content management system across all of our daily newspaper markets - have created additional operating efficiencies and cost savings. We have templated designs for our printed and digital editions, and we have created a national news desk that shares high quality content across all of our markets, including national news, regional news and other special sections content. The national news desk allows our newsrooms to focus on high quality local content. We believe we will continue to create additional operational efficiencies and continue to transform our business model.
 
 2



Several of our businesses operate in geographic groups of publications, or “clusters,” which provide operational efficiencies, extend sales penetration and provide broader audiences for advertisers. A table under the caption “Daily Newspapers and Markets” in Item 1, included herein, identifies those groups of our newspapers operating in clusters.
 
Our local media operations compete with other media and digital companies for advertising and marketing spend as well as other news and information outlets for subscription spend. While very few of our local media operations have similar daily print competitors that are published in the same city, our local media operations compete with the following types of businesses:
 

• | Other media including magazines, radio, television, outdoor/billboard advertising, other classified and specialty publications, other print publications both free and paid, direct mail, directories, and national, regional and local advertising websites and content providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The number of competitors in any given market varies, however all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in all of our markets.
 
Lee Enterprises, Incorporated was founded in 1890, incorporated in 1950, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1978.
 
Our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to repay, refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due, and remain in compliance with debt covenants. We are in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 29, 2019. The information included herein should be evaluated in that context. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information.
 
STRATEGIC INITIATIVES
 
Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 
Comprehensive Local News That Drives Frequency and Engagement. We drive frequency and engagement with our products by delivering valuable, intensely local, original news and information that we believe in many cases our audiences cannot otherwise readily obtain. Our talented news and editorial staff provide constant, real-time local news with significant breadth, depth and reliability. We believe the strength of our local brands is the result of the quality of our news gathering staff. This allows us to provide the most comprehensive coverage of local news in our markets. In most of our markets, we are the leading source of print and digital news and information.
 
We are focused on continually improving the functionality and design of all our news platforms, allowing us to provide greater depth of coverage and increasing reader engagement. Our local news teams leverage many centralized resources including teams that are responsible for design, national news, syndicated content, digital content, video and data analytics. We are providing our journalists with tools to give them real-time information about audience engagement on our digital platforms. This helps inform their decisions on both presentation and coverage. Driving efficiencies within all of these areas allows for more robust local news content.
 
We believe our journalists are at the forefront of gathering and producing news and information about their local community. We seek to grow our digital audience by engaging our readers with news and information that we believe stirs public awareness, advances ideas, inspires vision, creates debate and provokes action. Through our news leadership we strive to contribute to community betterment, promote education, foster commerce and help improve the quality of life in our markets.
 
Become Predominately Digital Revenue Driven. Our digital businesses have experienced rapid growth, and since 2011 total digital revenue, which includes digital advertising, digital only subscription revenue and digital services revenue, increased at a compound annual growth rate of 10.9%. In 2019, total digital revenue grew 4.0% and totaled $144,646,000 or 28.4% of our total operating revenue. The increase was fueled by growing our digital audiences, increases in our rates, 79.1% growth in digital only subscribers and rapid growth at TownNews.
 
We are growing digital revenue by offering an expansive array of digital products including: video, behavioral targeting, audience retargeting, banner ads, social networking, and digital couponing. Through Amplified Agency, we provide digital marketing services to SMBs, including Search Engine Marketing (SEM), social media, audience extension, business profiles, and website hosting and design.
 
 3



We believe that these innovative solutions will continue to drive meaningful new opportunities for us to grow our digital marketing revenue. We also continue to expand our array of digital products to address advertisers' evolving needs and contend with competition while seeking to increase our share of advertising and marketing services spending from existing customers.
 
Growing digital subscribers is another key to becoming predominately digital revenue driven. Our digital audiences are comprised of full access members, digital only members and non-members who access our site subject to our paywall limits. More than 60% of our full access members have activated their digital access, and the number of digital only members increased 79.1% in 2019. In 2019, we averaged 29,334,000 monthly unique visitors across all of our digital products and as of September 29, 2019, we had 91,000 digital only members.
 
In 2020, we expect to increase our investment in growing our audiences by using data and analytics to drive our acquisition strategy. Our primary acquisition tactics include sophisticated data-mining techniques leveraging both online and offline consumer behaviors to target full access and digital-only subscription offers. These targeted offers are presented to consumers via integrated marketing campaigns including email, on-site messaging, direct mail, social media and other sales channels designed to maximize exposure and increase response rate.
 
We believe TownNews represents a powerful opportunity for us to drive additional digital revenue. In 2019, revenue at TownNews totaled almost $23,000,000 and since 2011 the compounded annual growth rate of TownNews revenue has been 10.9%.
 
In 2018, TownNews expanded its broadcast and video capabilities by acquiring an acclaimed video management and streaming solution for media operations. The investment allows TownNews’ customers to have broadcast quality video available for desktop, mobile and OTT applications. TownNews leveraged these investments to diversify its customer base to include broadcast customers.
 
In 2019, TownNews acquired a wordpress-based content management system ("CMS") business, which helped broaden product offerings and gain additional broadcast customers. In 2020, we believe TownNews is poised for continued growth.
 
Accelerate Local Retail Performance. Local, controllable retail accounts - those in which our local sales teams have direct contact with the advertising decision makers - are the core of our business. This revenue category represents more than 50% of advertising revenue and is comprised of top local accounts and SMBs. Our historical financial results for this revenue category are better than our overall results. We believe we can accelerate financial performance in this revenue category as we have unmatched audience reach in our local markets through our print and digital product offerings.
 

• | Our local sales forces are larger than any local competitor, and we believe they are the most highly trained and proficient sales force in our markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have strong relationships with businesses in our markets and offer a wide array of products to deliver our advertisers' message.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our sales executives pitch the power of our audiences directly to local decision makers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2020, our tactics to drive digital advertising revenue are focused on:
 

• | Top local account management. Top local accounts are a subset of local retail and this category represented 20.7% of our total advertising revenue in 2019. In 2020 we expect to better align sales management talent and resources towards these higher value local retail accounts in an effort to drive revenue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drive advertiser retention among SMBs through tracking KPIs focused on customer frequency and engagement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand on the success of Amplified Agency. Launched company-wide in 2019, the Amplified Agency is a sophisticated data-driven digital marketing agency. Revenue generated from the agency increased 29% in 2019 and we believe the Amplified Agency will continue to drive revenue growth in 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generate Strong Adjusted EBITDA(1) With A Commitment To Reduce Our Debt. We expect to continue to drive strong Adjusted EBITDA through steadfast focus on driving revenue and continued rationalization of our legacy cost base. In 2019, on a same property basis we reduced cash costs(1) 5.9%. With a substantial portion of our cost base tied to printing and distributing our printed products, we expect to continue to implement cost efficiencies while investing in revenue drivers.
 
We anticipate modest capital expenditures and pension contributions, and we expect to continue to use substantially all of our available cash flow to reduce debt. 
 
The principal amount of debt was reduced by $41.2 million in 2019 with a total debt balance of $443.6 million as of September 29, 2019. Since 2005, we have reduced debt by more than $1 billion and we expect to continue to significantly reduce our debt in 2020. As a result of our debt reductions, interest expense was reduced by $5.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018, providing additional free cash flow for debt service and other corporate uses.
 
(1) See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures: in Item 7, included herein, for additional information.
 
PULITZER 
 
In 2005, we acquired Pulitzer Inc. (“Pulitzer”). We currently publish 9 daily newspapers that were acquired from Pulitzer and more than 60 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also includes our 50% interest in TNI, as discussed more fully below.
 
Pulitzer newspapers' largest operations include Bloomington, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri, where its subsidiary, St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (“PD LLC”), publishes the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, our only major daily newspaper, which serves the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. St. Louis newspaper operations also include a variety of specialty publications, and supports its related digital products as well as the Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, a group of weekly newspapers and niche publications that focus on separate communities within the metropolitan area.
 
The 2005 acquisition was financed primarily with debt. The second lien term loan lenders have a first lien on Pulitzer assets. Excess cash flow from Pulitzer, as defined in the Second Lien Loan Agreement, and cash flow from Pulitzer asset sales are used to pay down the second lien term loan, at par.
 
TNI Partners 
 
In conjunction with the Pulitzer acquisition we obtained a 50% interest in TNI, the Tucson, Arizona newspaper partnership. TNI, acting as agent for our subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (“Star Publishing”) and Citizen Publishing Company (“Citizen”), the owner of the remaining 50%, a subsidiary of Gannett Co., Inc., (“Gannett”), is responsible for printing, delivery, advertising and subscription activities of the Arizona Daily Star and the Tucson Citizen. In May 2009, Citizen discontinued print publication of the Tucson Citizen and in 2014 stopped publishing its digital product.
 
TNI collects all receipts and income and pays substantially all operating expenses incident to the partnership's operations and publication of the newspaper and other media. Under the amended and restated operating agreement between Star Publishing and Citizen, the Arizona Daily Star remains the separate property of Star Publishing. Results of TNI are accounted for using the equity method. Income or loss of TNI (before income taxes) is allocated equally to Star Publishing and Citizen. TNI makes weekly distributions to Star Publishing and Citizen of all available cash.
 
The TNI agency agreement (“Agency Agreement”), has governed the operation since 1940. The Agency Agreement expires in 2040, but contains an option, which may be exercised by either party, to renew the agreement for successive periods of 25 years each. Star Publishing and Citizen also have a reciprocal right of first refusal to acquire the 50% interest in TNI owned by Citizen and Star Publishing, respectively, under certain circumstances. Both the Company and Citizen incur certain administrative costs and capital expenditures that are reported by their individual companies.
 
MADISON NEWSPAPERS 
 
We own 50% of the capital stock of Madison Newspapers, Inc. (MNI) and 8.7% of the total stock of The Capital Times Company (“TCT”). TCT owns 50% of the capital stock of MNI. MNI publishes daily and Sunday newspapers, and other publications in Madison, Wisconsin, and other Wisconsin locations, and supports their related digital products. MNI conducts business under the trade name Capital Newspapers. We have a contract to furnish the editorial and news content for the Wisconsin State Journal, which is published by MNI, and periodically provide other services to MNI for a fee. Results of MNI are accounted for using the equity method. Net income or loss of MNI (after income taxes) is allocated equally to the Company and TCT. MNI makes quarterly dividend payments to the Company and TCT.

NEWSPRINT 
 
The raw material of newspapers, and our other print publications, is newsprint. We purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. We believe we will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for our needs and consider our relationships with newsprint producers to be good. Newsprint purchase prices can be volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs and both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Price fluctuations can affect our results of operations. We have not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk”, included herein.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION 
 
We have a long history of sound corporate governance practices. Our Board of Directors has a lead independent director, and has had one for many years. Currently, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that seven of its ten members are independent, including all members of the Board's Audit, Executive Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees. The Audit Committee approves all services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm and its affiliates.
 
In 2019, the Company enhanced corporate governance practices to further increase the Board’s effectiveness and accountability to shareholders, by:
 

• | Adopting a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Allowing proxy access, providing shareholders who satisfy the requirements specified in the amended bylaws the ability to include their own nominees in the Company’s proxy statement;
• | Allowing substantially more time for shareholders to submit proposals and director nominations for consideration at annual meetings; and 
• | Demonstrating a commitment to board refreshment through the nomination of three new independent board members.
