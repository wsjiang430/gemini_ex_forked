Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading commercial real estate finance company structured as an internally-managed REIT. We conduct our business through three commercial real estate-related business lines: loans, securities, and real estate investments. We believe that our in-house origination platform, ability to flexibly allocate capital among complementary product lines, credit-centric underwriting approach, access to diversified financing sources, and experienced management team position us well to deliver attractive returns on equity to our shareholders through economic and credit cycles.
Our businesses, including balance sheet lending, conduit lending, securities investments, and real estate investments, provide for a stable base of net interest and rental income. We have originated $22.8 billion of commercial real estate loans from our inception through December 31, 2018. During this timeframe, we also acquired $10.6 billion of predominantly investment grade-rated securities secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and $1.7 billion of selected net leased and other real estate assets. 
As part of our commercial mortgage lending operations, we originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans on stabilized, income producing commercial real estate properties that we intend to make available for sale in commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) securitizations. From our inception in October 2008 through December 31, 2018, we originated $15.5 billion of conduit loans, $15.4 billion of which were sold into 59 CMBS securitizations, making us, by volume, the second largest non-bank contributor of loans to CMBS securitizations in the United States in such period. Our sales of loans into securitizations are generally accounted for as true sales, not financings, and we generally retain no ongoing interest in loans which we securitize unless we are required to do so as issuer pursuant to the risk retention requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The securitization of conduit loans enables us to reinvest our equity capital into new loan originations or allocate it to other investments. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had $6.3 billion in total assets and $1.6 billion of total equity. Our assets included $3.5 billion of loans, $1.4 billion of securities, and $1.0 billion of real estate.
We have a diversified and flexible financing strategy supporting our business operations, including unsecured debt and significant committed term financing from leading financial institutions. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion of unsecured debt financing outstanding. This unsecured financing was comprised of $266.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”), $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” collectively with the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes, the “Notes”), and there were no borrowings outstanding under our $266.4 million Revolving Credit Facility.
In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had $3.3 billion of secured debt financing outstanding. This financing was comprised of $1.3 billion of financing from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the “FHLB”), $497.5 million of committed secured term repurchase agreement financing, $166.2 million of other securities financing, $743.9 million of third-party, non-recourse mortgage debt and $601.5 million of collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) debt and $2.5 million of participation financing - mortgage loan receivable. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had $2.6 billion of committed, undrawn total funding capacity available, consisting of $266.4 million of availability under our $266.4 million Revolving Credit Facility, $647.5 million of undrawn committed FHLB financing and $1.7 billion of other undrawn committed financings. As of December 31, 2018, our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.7:1.0, as we employ leverage prudently to maximize financial flexibility. Our adjusted leverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 2.3:1.0 as of December 31, 2018. See “—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our definition of adjusted leverage and a reconciliation to debt obligations, net. 

Ladder was founded in October 2008 and we completed our IPO in February 2014. We are led by a disciplined and highly aligned management team. As of December 31, 2018, our management team and directors held interests in our Company comprising 11.5% of our total equity. On average, our management team members have 29 years of experience in the industry. Our management team includes Brian Harris, Chief Executive Officer; Pamela McCormack, President; Marc Fox, Chief Financial Officer; Thomas Harney, Head of Merchant Banking & Capital Markets; and Robert Perelman, Head of Asset Management. Additional officers of Ladder include Kelly Porcella, General Counsel and Secretary, and Kevin Moclair, Chief Accounting Officer. We employ 74 full-time industry professionals.

We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to shareholders if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income and comply with certain other requirements. 
Recent Developments
Lease Prepayment by Lessor and Retirement of Related Mortgage Loan Financing
On January 10, 2019, the Company received $10.0 million prepayment of a lease on a single-tenant industrial two-story office building in Wayne, NJ. As of December 31, 2018, this property had a book value of $8.2 million, which is net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million. The Company intends to recognize the $10.0 million of operating lease income on a straight-line basis over the revised lease term, which ends on May 31, 2019. On February 6, 2019, the Company paid off $6.6 million of mortgage loan financing related to the property, recognizing a loss on defeasance of debt of $1.1 million.
Committed Loan Repurchase Facility
On February 26, 2019, the Company executed an amendment of one of its committed loan repurchase facilities with a major banking institution, providing for, among other things, the extension of the initial term of the facility to February 24, 2022 and continues to have two additional 12-month extension periods at Company’s option. No new advances are permitted after the initial maturity date.

We invest in the following types of assets:

Loans

Balance Sheet First Mortgage Loans.  We originate and invest in balance sheet first mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate properties that are undergoing transition, including lease-up, sell-out, and renovation or repositioning. These mortgage loans are structured to fit the needs and business plans of the property owners, and generally have LIBOR based floating rates and terms (including extension options) ranging from one to five years. Our loans are directly originated by an internal team that has longstanding and strong relationships with borrowers and mortgage brokers throughout the United States. We follow a rigorous investment process, which begins with an initial due diligence review; continues through a comprehensive legal and underwriting process incorporating multiple internal and external checks and balances; and culminates in approval or disapproval of each prospective investment by our Investment Committee. Balance sheet first mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million also require the approval of our board of directors’ Risk and Underwriting Committee.
7

We generally seek to hold our balance sheet first mortgage loans for investment although we also maintain the flexibility to contribute such loans into a CLO or similar structure, sell participation interests or “b-notes” in our mortgage loans or sell such mortgage loans as whole loans. These investments have been typically repaid at or prior to maturity (including by being refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization). As of December 31, 2018, we held a portfolio of 157 balance sheet first mortgage loans with an aggregate book value of $3.2 billion. Based on the loan balances and the “as-is” third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of this portfolio was 68.2% at December 31, 2018.

Other Commercial Real Estate-Related Loans.  We selectively invest in note purchase financings, subordinated debt, mezzanine debt and other structured finance products related to commercial real estate that are generally held for investment. As of December 31, 2018, we held a portfolio of 30 other commercial real estate-related loans with an aggregate book value of $147.6 million. Based on the loan balance and the “as-is” third-party FIRREA appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the portfolio was 68.3% at December 31, 2018.
Conduit First Mortgage Loans.  We also originate conduit loans, which are first mortgage loans that are secured by cash-flowing commercial real estate and are available for sale to securitizations. These first mortgage loans are typically structured with fixed interest rates and generally have five- to ten-year terms. Conduit first mortgage loans are originated, underwritten, approved and funded using the same comprehensive legal and underwriting approach, process and personnel used to originate our balance sheet first mortgage loans. Conduit first mortgage loans in excess of $50.0 million also require approval of our board of directors’ Risk and Underwriting Committee.
Although our primary intent is to sell our conduit first mortgage loans to CMBS trusts, we generally seek to maintain the flexibility to keep them on our balance sheet, sell participation interests or “b-notes” in our conduit first mortgage loans or sell conduit first mortgage loans as whole loans. From our inception in 2008 through December 31, 2018, we have originated and funded $15.5 billion of conduit first mortgage loans and securitized $15.4 billion of such mortgage loans in 59 separate transactions, including two securitizations in 2010, three securitizations in 2011, six securitizations in 2012, six securitizations in 2013, 10 securitizations in 2014, 10 securitizations in 2015, six securitizations in 2016, seven securitizations in 2017 and nine securitizations in 2018. We generally securitize our loans together with certain financial institutions, which to date have included affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. We have also completed three single-asset securitizations, executed a Ladder-only multi-borrower securitization from Ladder’s CMBS shelf in June 2017 and completed our first contributions of shorter-term loans into CLO transactions in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we held 10 first mortgage loans that were available for contribution into a securitization with an aggregate book value of $182.4 million. Based on the loan balances and the “as-is” third-party Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”) appraised values at origination, the weighted average loan- to-value ratio of this portfolio was 64.7% at December 31, 2018. The Company holds these conduit loans in its taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).

Securities

CMBS Investments.  We invest in CMBS secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate and own predominantly AAA-rated securities. These investments provide a stable and attractive base of net interest income and help us manage our liquidity. We have significant in-house expertise in the evaluation and trading of CMBS, due in part to our experience in originating and underwriting mortgage loans that comprise assets within CMBS trusts, as well as our experience in structuring CMBS transactions. AAA-rated CMBS or U.S. Agency securities investments in excess of $76.0 million and all other investment grade CMBS or U.S. Agency securities investments in excess of $51.0 million, each in any single class of any single issuance, require the approval of our board of directors’ Risk and Underwriting Committee. The Risk and Underwriting Committee also must approve any investments in non-rated or sub-investment grade CMBS or U.S. Agency Securities in any single class of any single issuance in excess of the lesser of (x) $21,000,000 and (y) 10% of the total net asset value of the respective Ladder investment company. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our portfolio of CMBS investments totaled $1.3 billion in 157 CUSIPs ($8.3 million average investment per CUSIP). As of December 31, 2018, included in the $1.3 billion of CMBS securities are $12.2 million of CMBS securities designated as risk retention securities under the Dodd-Frank Act which are subject to transfer restrictions over the term of the securitization trust. As of that date, 100% of our CMBS investments were rated investment grade by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Inc., consisting of 84.4% AAA/Aaa-rated securities and 15.5% of other investment grade-rated securities, including 12.5% rated AA/Aa, 2% rated A/A and 1.1% rated BBB/Baa. In the future, we may invest in CMBS securities or other securities that are unrated. As of December 31, 2018, our CMBS investments had a weighted average duration of 2.3 years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, by property count and market value, respectively, 52.6% and 90.6% of the collateral underlying our CMBS investment portfolio was distributed throughout the top 25 metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) in the United States, with 5.5% and 11.5%, by property count and market value, respectively, of the collateral located in the New York-Newark-Edison MSA, and the concentrations in each of the remaining top 24 MSAs ranging from 0.2% to 7.1% by property count and 0.1% to 64.5% by market value.
U.S. Agency Securities Investments.  Our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio consists of securities for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”), or by a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). In addition, these securities are secured by first mortgage loans on commercial real estate. Investments in U.S. Agency Securities are subject to the same Risk and Underwriting Committee approval requirements as CMBS investments, as described above. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our portfolio of U.S. Agency Securities was $36.4 million in 20 CUSIPs ($1.8 million average investment per CUSIP), with a weighted average duration of 4.9 years. The commercial real estate collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio is located throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2018, by market value, 76.7% and 18.0% of the collateral underlying our U.S. Agency Securities, excluding the collateral underlying our Agency interest-only securities, was located in New York and California, respectively, with no other state having a concentration greater than 10.0%. By property count, California represented 75.9% and New York represented 3.4% of such collateral. While the specific geographic concentration of our Agency interest-only securities portfolio as of December 31, 2018 is not obtainable, risk relating to any such possible concentration is mitigated by the interest payments of these securities being guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or a GSE.
Corporate Bonds.  In addition to CMBS and U.S. Agency Securities, we invest in other debt securities, including but not limited to debt securities issued by REITs and real estate companies. Approval of our board of directors’ Risk and Underwriting Committee is required for the aggregate investments in such debt securities made and owned by all Ladder investment companies to exceed $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our portfolio of debt securities was $53.9 million in two CUSIPs ($26.9 million average investment per CUSIP), with a weighted average duration of 2.5 years.
Equity Securities.  We invest in real estate related equity investments. Approval of our board of directors’ Risk and Underwriting Committee is required for the aggregate real estate related equity investments made and owned by all Ladder investment companies to exceed $20.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated fair value of our portfolio of equity securities was $11.5 million in three CUSIPs ($3.8 million average investment per CUSIP).
Real Estate
Commercial Real Estate Properties.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned 143 single tenant net leased properties with an aggregate book value of $673.4 million. These properties are fully leased on a net basis where the tenant is generally responsible for payment of real estate taxes, property, building and general liability insurance and property and building maintenance expenses. As of December 31, 2018, our net leased properties comprised a total of 5.2 million square feet, 100% leased with an average age since construction of 14.2 years and a weighted average remaining lease term of 13.3 years.

Other Investments
Unconsolidated Joint Venture.  In connection with the origination of a loan in April 2012, we received a 25% equity interest with the right to convert upon a capital event. On March 22, 2013, we refinanced the loan, and we converted our equity interest into a 19% limited liability company membership interest in Grace Lake JV, LLC (“Grace Lake LLC”).

On August 7, 2015, the Company entered into a joint venture, 24 Second Avenue Holdings LLC (“24 Second Avenue”), with an operating partner to invest in a ground-up condominium construction and development project located at 24 Second Avenue, New York, NY. The Company contributed $31.1 million for a 73.8% interest, with the operating partner holding the remaining 26.2% interest. The Company is entitled to income allocations and distributions based upon its membership interest of 73.8% until the Company achieves a 1.70x profit multiple, after which, income is allocated and distributed 50% to the Company and 50% to the operating partner. As of December 31, 2016, the previously existing building had been demolished and the site was cleared with all supportive excavation work completed, and we are anticipating completion of the new construction in 2018. 24 Second Avenue consists of 31 residential condominium units and one commercial condominium unit.

We enter into interest rate and credit spread derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. We generally seek to hedge the interest rate risk on the financing of assets that have a duration longer than five years, including newly-originated conduit first mortgage loans, securities in our CMBS portfolio if long enough in duration, and most of our U.S. Agency Securities portfolio. We monitor our asset profile and our hedge positions to manage our interest rate and credit spread exposures, and we seek to match fund our assets according to the liquidity characteristics and expected holding periods of our assets.

We generally seek to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3.0:1.0 or below. We expect this ratio to fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year due to the normal course of business in our conduit lending operations, in which we generally securitize our inventory of conduit loans at intervals, and also because of changes in our asset mix, due in part to such securitizations. As of December 31, 2018, our debt-to-equity ratio was 2.7:1.0. Our adjusted leverage, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 2.3:1.0 as of December 31, 2018. See “—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our definition of adjusted leverage and a reconciliation to debt obligations, net. We believe that our predominantly senior secured assets and our moderate leverage provide financial flexibility to be able to capitalize on attractive market opportunities as they arise.

From time to time, we may add financing counterparties that we believe will complement our business, although the agreements governing our indebtedness may limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. Our amended and restated charter and by-laws do not impose any threshold limits on our ability to use leverage.
Business Outlook

We believe the commercial real estate finance market is currently characterized by solid demand for fixed and floating rate mortgage financing supported by stable property values in most parts of the U.S. The demand is driven by acquisitions and refinancings of existing properties, the need to fund expenditures to renovate or otherwise improve buildings, and new real estate development. After an extended period of low and stable interest rates in the U.S., recent interest rate increases and concerns regarding the potential for additional future interest rate increases has also contributed to demand for long term fixed rate mortgage financing. More than $1.9 trillion of commercial real estate debt is scheduled to mature over the next five years (according to Trepp), providing a substantial foundation of demand for mortgage financing services going forward. Somewhat offsetting these positive macro market factors is the yield curve's flattening trend which may reflect a market anticipating slower economic growth in the future.
From our perspective as a commercial mortgage lender that finances its customers’ real estate investments nationwide, the trends observed in the commercial mortgage backed securities market are often informative and somewhat predictive. In 2017, new U.S. CMBS issuance volume increased 27.1% to $87.8 billion in comparison to 2016, a year in which swings in credit spreads created uncertainty for lenders and borrowers thereby suppressing transaction activity. The return to positive annual growth in U.S. CMBS issuance volume in 2017 was, at least in part, due to more stable and favorable credit spread environment. Although spreads continued to tighten into the beginning of 2018, they mostly widened during the rest of the year. Still, the U.S. CMBS new issuance market was active in 2018, with issuance totaling $77.0 billion during the year, a decrease of 12.3% compared to 2017, but an increase of 11.4% compared to 2016.
We believe the CMBS market will continue to play an important role in the financing of commercial real estate that is expected to produce substantial streams of stabilized income over multiple years and we expect to continue to participate in this market as a loan originator and a contributor of loans to securitization transactions in which CMBS are issued. We also expect to continue to be active as a lender to owners of properties that are in transition and are expected to start generating substantial streams of stabilized income after the financed property’s transition plan has been executed. Our ability to offer borrowers mortgage loan financing on transitional properties enables us to remain an active lender even when the CMBS market experiences disruptions or periods of slower activity that impair the origination of new loans for securitization.
Reflected in all of these lending and financing capabilities that Ladder applies in its daily operations is its ability to apply superior credit skills in the underwriting of commercial real estate debt and equity investments while maintaining the ability to efficiently shift capital among mortgage loans, securities, and real estate investments. Underwriting commercial real estate credit risk is Ladder’s core strength—and Ladder expresses its view of the commercial real estate market and of specific investment opportunities within it by making loans, investing in debt securities, and acquiring real estate—constantly fine-tuning that mix of investments in an ongoing effort to optimize risk adjusted returns on equity.

Factors impacting operating results

There are a number of factors that influence our operating results in a meaningful way. The most significant factors include: (1) our competition; (2) market and economic conditions; (3) loan origination volume; (4) profitability of securitizations; (5) avoidance of credit losses; (6) availability of debt and equity funding and the costs of that funding; (7) the net interest margin on our investments; (8) effectiveness of our hedging and other risk management practices; (9) real estate transactions volumes; (10) occupancy rates; and (11) expense management.
Investment Process 
Origination 
Our team of originators is responsible for sourcing and directly originating new commercial first mortgage loans from the brokerage community and directly from real estate owners, operators, developers and investors. The extensive industry experience of our management team and origination team has enabled us to build a strong network of mortgage brokers and direct borrowers throughout the commercial real estate community in the United States. 
Credit and Underwriting 
Our underwriting and credit process commences upon receipt of a potential borrower’s executed loan application and non-refundable deposit. 
Our underwriters conduct a thorough due diligence process for each prospective investment. The team coordinates in-house and third-party due diligence for each prospective loan as part of a checklist-based process that is designed to ensure that each loan receives a systematic evaluation. Elements of the underwriting process generally include: 
Cash Flow Analysis. We create an estimated cash flow analysis and underwriting model for each prospective investment. Creation of the cash flow analysis generally draws on an assessment of current and historical data related to the property’s rent roll, operating expenses, net operating income, leasing cost, and capital expenditures. Underwriting evaluates and factors in assumptions regarding current market rents, vacancy rates, operating expenses, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, replacement reserves, renewal probabilities and concession packages based on observable conditions in the subject property’s sub-market at the time of underwriting. The cash flow analysis may also rely upon third-party environmental and engineering reports to estimate the cost to repair or remediate any identified environmental and/or property-level deficiencies. The final underwritten cash flow analysis is used to estimate the property’s overall value and its ability to produce cash flow to service the proposed loan. 
Borrower Analysis. Careful attention is also paid to the proposed borrower, including an analysis based on available information of its credit history, financial standing, existing portfolio and sponsor exposure to leverage and contingent liabilities, capacity and capability to manage and lease the collateral, depth of organization, knowledge of the local market, and understanding of the proposed product type. We also generally commission and review a third-party background check of our prospective borrower and sponsor. 
Site Inspection. A Ladder underwriter typically conducts a physical site inspection of each property. The site inspection gives the underwriter insights into the local market and the property’s positioning within it, confirms that tenants are in-place, and generally helps to ensure that the property has the characteristics, qualities, and potential value represented by the borrower. 
Legal Due Diligence. Our in-house transaction management team, comprised of experienced attorneys, manages, negotiates, structures and closes all transactions and completes legal due diligence on each property, borrower, and sponsor, including the evaluation of documents such as leases, title, title insurance, opinion letters, tenant estoppels, organizational documents, and other agreements and documents related to the property or the loan.
Third-party Appraisal. We generally commission an appraisal from a member of the Appraisal Institute to provide an independent opinion of value as well as additional supporting property and market data. Appraisals generally include detailed data on recent property sales, local rents, vacancy rates, supply, absorption, demographics and employment, as well as a detailed projected cash flow and valuation analysis. We typically use the independent appraiser’s valuation to calculate ratios such as loan-to-value and loan-to-stabilized-value ratio, as well as to serve as an independent source to which the in-house cash flow and valuation model can be compared. 
14

Third-party Engineering Report. We generally engage an approved licensed engineer to complete property condition/engineering reports and a seismic report for applicable properties. The engineering report is intended to identify any issues with respect to the safety and soundness of a property that may warrant further investigation, and provide estimates of ongoing replacement reserves, overall replacement cost, and the cost to bring a property into good repair. 
Third-party Environmental Report. We also generally engage an approved environmental consulting firm to complete a Phase I Environmental Assessment to identify and evaluate potential environmental issues at the property and may also order and review Phase II Environmental Assessments and/or Operations & Maintenance plans if applicable. Environmental reports and supporting documentation are typically reviewed in-house as well as by our dedicated outside environmental counsel who prepares a summary report on each property. 
Third-party Insurance Review. A third-party insurance specialist reviews each prospective borrower’s existing insurance program to analyze the specific risk exposure of each property and to ensure that coverage is in compliance with our standard insurance requirements. Our transaction management team oversees this third-party review and makes the conclusions of their analysis available to the underwriting team. 
A credit memorandum is prepared to summarize the results of the underwriting and due diligence process for the consideration of the Investment Committee. We thoroughly document the due diligence process up to and including the credit memorandum and maintain an organized digital archive of our work. 
Transaction Management 
The transaction management team is generally responsible for coordinating and managing outside counsel, working directly with originators, underwriters and borrowers to manage, structure, negotiate and close all transactions, including the securitization of our loans. The transaction management team plays an integral role in the legal underwriting of each property, consults with outside counsel on significant business, credit and/or legal issues, and facilitates the funding and closing of all investments and dispositions. The transaction management team also supports asset management and investment realization activities, including coordination of post-closing issues and assistance with loan sales, financings, refinancing and repayments. 
Investment Committee Approval 
All loan and real estate investments require approval from our Investment Committee, comprised of Brian Harris, CEO; Pamela McCormack, President; and Michael Scarola, Chief Credit Officer. The Investment Committee generally requires each investment to be fully described in a comprehensive Investment Committee memorandum that identifies the investment, the due diligence conducted and the findings, as well as all identified related risks and mitigants. The Investment Committee meets regularly to ensure that all investments are fully vetted prior to issuance of Investment Committee approval. 
In addition to Investment Committee approval, the Risk and Underwriting Committee of our board of directors approves all loan and real estate investments above certain thresholds, which are currently set at $50.0 million for loans and $20.0 million for real estate investments.
Financing 
Prior to securitization or other disposition, or in the case of balance sheet loans, maturity, we finance most of the loans we originate using our multiple committed term facilities from leading financial institutions and our membership in the FHLB. Our finance team endeavors to match the characteristics and expected holding periods of the assets being financed with the characteristics of the financing options available and our short and long term cash needs in determining the appropriate financing approaches to be applied. The approaches we apply to financing our assets are a key component of our asset/liability risk management strategy with respect to managing liquidity risk. These approaches, supplemented by the use of hedging primarily via the use of standard derivative instruments, facilitate the prudent management of our interest rate and credit spread exposures. 
15

Asset Management 
The asset management team, together with our third-party servicers, monitors the credit performance of our investment portfolio, working closely with borrowers and/or their partners to monitor performance of our collateral assets and overseeing our real estate portfolio. Asset management focuses on careful asset specific and market surveillance, active enforcement of loan and security rights, and regular review of potential disposition strategies. Loan modifications, asset recapitalizations and other necessary variations to a borrower’s or partner’s business plan or budget will generally be vetted through the asset management team with a recommended course of action presented to the Investment Committee for approval. 
Specific responsibilities of the asset management team include:

• | coordinating cash processing and cash management for collections and distributions through lock box accounts that are set up to trap all cash flow from a property;


• | monitoring tax and insurance administration to ensure timely payments to appropriate authorities and maintenance or placement of applicable insurance coverages;


• | assisting with escrow analysis to maintain appropriate balances in required accounts;


• | monitoring UCC administration for continued compliance with lien laws in various jurisdictions;


• | assisting with reserve and draw management from pre-funded accounts and future advance obligations, including, where appropriate, working with borrowers to recast business plans and rebalance loan reserves to account for changes in business plans;


• | coordinating and conducting site inspections and surveillance activities including periodic analysis of financial statements;


• | re-underwriting assets regularly in order to monitor asset and market level performance;


• | maintaining regular communication with local market participants, including brokers and appraisers, to monitor changes in local market conditions;


• | where appropriate, identifying existing loan exposures for refinance through the CMBS market;


• | reviewing operating statements (including rent rolls) and comparing financial performance and timing of asset to original underwriting and current budgets;


• | reviewing for approval as required by the loan agreements items including major leases, management/franchise agreements, other major/significant contracts and agreements;


• | reviewing available information for any material variances; and


• | completing and updating asset summary reviews and providing active portfolio management reporting to ensure that borrowers remain compliant with the terms of their loans and remain on target for established budgets and business plans.

Disposition and Distribution 
Our securitization team works with our transaction management and underwriting teams to realize our disposition strategy of selling certain first mortgage loans into CMBS securitization trusts. We typically partner with other leading financial institutions to contribute loans to multi-asset securitizations. We have also led single asset securitizations on single loans we have originated. 
From time to time, our registered broker-dealer subsidiary, Ladder Capital Securities LLC (“LCS”), may act as a co-manager for the underwriting syndicate of public and private CMBS securitizations where an affiliate of LCS is contributing collateral to the CMBS deal as a loan seller. In such instances, LCS, as a co-manager, will participate in the underwriting syndicate, on a best efforts basis, to structure and arrange the bond issuance and participate in the associated investor meetings and road shows. LCS generally does not receive any allocation of securities in these offerings for distribution to investor accounts and, as such, has not participated in the direct sale of any CMBS to institutional and/or retail investors. During the year ended December 31, 2018, LCS recorded no fee income resulting from securitization transactions, which was eliminated upon consolidation.
In addition, Ladder has from time to time purchased predominantly AAA-rated CMBS from securitizations into which we have sold conduit first mortgage loans, generally as one of several loan contributors. In such instances, however, we have not participated as a co-manager in the underwriting syndicates. As of December 31, 2018, we owned $69.6 million of such CMBS, representing 6.7% of the $1.0 billion of CMBS issued by the related securitization trusts. As with our other CMBS investments, we purchased these securities in both primary and secondary market transactions over time. 
16

In June 2016, our subsidiary, Ladder Capital Commercial Mortgage Securities LLC, successfully had its shelf registration statement declared effective with the SEC which permits us to act as an issuer in a public securitization of first mortgage loans contributed by us (and/or a third-party loan contributor). We may, in the future, contribute first mortgage loans to a securitization utilizing this shelf registration statement or future shelf registration statements.
In addition to contributing first mortgage loans into CMBS securitization trusts, we also maintain the flexibility to keep such loans on our balance sheet, contribute loans into a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) or similar structure, sell participation interests or “b-notes” in our first mortgage loans or sell first mortgage loans as whole loans. Balance sheet loans that are refinanced by us into a new conduit first mortgage loan upon property stabilization and intended for securitization are re-underwritten and structured by our origination, underwriting and transaction management teams. 
Our asset management team also manages sales of our real property and works with our trading and finance teams on sales of securities. 
Competition 
The commercial real estate finance markets are highly competitive. We face competition for lending and investment opportunities from a variety of institutional lenders and investors and many other market participants, including specialty finance companies, other REITs, commercial banks and thrift institutions, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial institutions. Many of these competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, including greater name recognition, established lending relationships with customers, financial resources, and access to capital. 
We compete on the basis of relationships, product offering, loan structure, terms, pricing and customer service. Our success depends on our ability to maintain and capitalize on relationships with borrowers and brokers, offer attractive loan products, remain competitive in pricing and terms, and provide superior service. 
Taxation
We have elected to be subject to tax as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015, and certain of our subsidiaries have also elected to be subject to tax as a REIT. To qualify as REITs, we must make qualifying distributions to shareholders and satisfy, on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stock ownership and other REIT requirements. If we fail to qualify as REITs, and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as REITs for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we lost our REIT qualification. The failure to qualify as REITs could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to shareholders. 
We utilize TRSs to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and to avoid penalty for the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. Any income associated with a TRS is fully taxable because a TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes as a domestic C corporation based upon its net income. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our taxation as a REIT.”
Regulation
Our operations are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and U.S. federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries’ businesses may rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”). These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third-parties who we do not control. 
17

Regulatory Reform 
The Dodd-Frank Act, which went into effect on July 21, 2010, is intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, various federal agencies have promulgated, or are in the process of promulgating, regulations and rules with respect to various issues that affect securitizations, including: (a) a rule that took effect December 24, 2016 (the “Risk Retention Rule”) requiring that either (i) a securitization’s sponsor retain, until the unpaid balance of the bonds or the loans is reduced by a certain amount, a 5% vertical interest in each class of securities issued, (ii) the sponsor or certain third-party purchasers (each, a “Third Party Purchaser”) retain, until the unpaid balance of the bonds or the loans is reduced by a certain amount (or for third-party purchasers, for at least five years), securities in an amount equal to 5% of the credit risk associated with the issued securities in the form of the subordinate tranches or (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii); (b) requirements for additional disclosure; (c) requirements for additional review and reporting (including revisions to Regulation AB); (d) for public securitizations, requirements that the chief executive officer (“CEO”) of an issuer file with the SEC an individual certificate attesting to certain matters, as described below; and (e) certain restrictions designed to prohibit conflicts of interest. Other regulations have been and may ultimately be adopted.
The Risk Retention Rule and other rules and regulations that have been adopted or may be adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act could alter the structure of securitizations in the future and could pose additional risks to or reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of our participation in future securitizations. In addition, such rules and regulations could reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of securitization in general or discourage traditional issuers, underwriters, b-piece buyers or other participants from participating in future securitizations and affect the availability of securitization platforms into which we can contribute mortgage loans, which may require that we take on additional roles and risks in connection with effectuating securitizations of mortgage loans. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Risk Retention Rule. 
Certain other recent and anticipated federal, state and municipal rules could also impact our business. These include (1) recent rules issued by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regarding commodity pool operator (“CPO”) and commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) registration and compliance obligations, (2) recent regulatory, reporting and compliance requirements applicable to swap dealers, security based swaps dealers and major swap participants under the Dodd-Frank Act, (3) recent Dodd-Frank Act regulations on derivative transactions, (4) changes to bank capital rules proposed by international regulators under the Fundamental Review of Trading Book (“FRTB”), which could require certain banks to maintain higher levels of capital when trading in securitization positions, (5) changes in capital requirements announced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and (6) requirements of certain states and municipalities, such as California and New York City, that require placement agents who solicit funds from the retirement and public pension systems to register as lobbyists. Although some of the rules may not affect us directly, the rules may affect issuers that sponsor securitizations in which we may sell commercial mortgage loans thereby potentially affecting the structure and/or profitability of this part of our business. Because some of the rules are not yet final or are in the process of being implemented, the full effect of the rules may not be known for some time. In addition, the SEC and other agencies continue to generate new rules. See also “Risk factors-Risks related to regulatory and compliance matters” and “Risk Factors-Risks related to hedging.”
Regulation of Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities

Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. We also are required to comply with certain provisions of, among other statutes and regulations, certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans, the USA PATRIOT Act, regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Asset Control and U.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations. 
18

Regulation as an Investment Adviser 
We conduct investment advisory activities in the United States through our subsidiary, Ladder Capital Asset Management LLC (“LCAM”), which is regulated by the SEC as a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). A registered investment adviser is subject to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit its clients. These laws and regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, record keeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, custody arrangements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an investment adviser and its advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In addition, these laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our advisory activities in the event we fail to comply with those laws and regulations. Sanctions that may be imposed for a failure to comply with applicable legal requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on our engaging in various advisory activities for specified periods of time, disgorgement, the revocation of registrations, and other censures and fines. 

We may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as our investment adviser subsidiary expands its product offerings and investment platform. For example, our investment adviser is currently an investment adviser to a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act. The mutual fund and our subsidiary that serves as its investment adviser are subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, which, among other things, govern the relationship between a mutual fund and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions and regulate the fees our subsidiary may earn from the mutual fund. This additional regulation could increase our compliance costs and create the potential for additional liabilities and penalties. 

The SEC and its staff continue to engage in various initiatives that may change the regulations governing our investment adviser subsidiary and its clients, particularly the mutual fund. In 2016, the SEC adopted a rule governing the liquidity requirements applicable to mutual funds. We may incur additional expense in connection with ensuring the mutual fund complies with the new rule, which is expected to become effective in 2019.
In 2017, a new Department of Labor regulation became applicable revising the definition of when a party may be providing advice as a “fiduciary” for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the IRS. Certain conditions of exemptions to the rule have been delayed, and the Department of Labor is currently re-examining the rule.  The rule creates certain compliance and operational challenges for companies that distribute investment products and in some cases may make it more difficult for our investment adviser to raise capital from benefit plan investors (including Individual Retirement Accounts) for clients that it may manage.
Regulation as a Broker-Dealer 
We have a subsidiary, Ladder Capital Securities LLC, that is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). This subsidiary, which from time to time co-manages the CMBS securitizations to which an affiliate contributes collateral as loan seller, is subject to regulations that cover all aspects of its business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, the capital structure of the subsidiary, recordkeeping, the financing of clients’ purchases and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Violations of these regulations can result in the revocation of its broker-dealer license (which could result in our having to hire new licensed investment professionals before continuing certain operations), the imposition of censure or fines and the suspension or expulsion of the subsidiary, its officers or employees from FINRA. The subsidiary also may be required to maintain certain minimum net capital. Rule 15c3-1 of the Exchange Act specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that a significant part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, limit the ratio of subordinated debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s uniform net capital rule imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC for certain withdrawals of capital. As of December 31, 2018, Ladder Capital Securities LLC was in compliance with the minimum net capital requirements.
19

Regulation as a Captive Insurance Company 
We maintain a captive insurance company, Tuebor, to provide coverage previously self insured by us, including nuclear, biological or chemical coverage, excess property coverage and excess errors and omissions coverage. It is regulated by the state of Michigan and is subject to regulations that cover all aspects of its business. Violations of these regulations can result in revocation of its authorization to do business as a captive insurer or result in censures or fines. The subsidiary is also subject to insurance laws of states other than Michigan (i.e., states where the insureds are located). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital resources.” 
Investment Company Act Exemption
We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 
If we or any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) fail to qualify for and maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, or an exclusion from the definition of an investment company, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, any of which could have an adverse effect on us, our financial results, the sustainability of our business model or the value of our securities.

If we or any of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) were required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the registered entity would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to capital structure (including the ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change its operation and we would not be able to conduct our business as described in this Annual Report. For example, because affiliate transactions are generally prohibited under the Investment Company Act, we would not be able to enter into certain transactions with any of our affiliates if we are required to register as an investment company, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. 
If we were required to register as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business. 
Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer which is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company for certain privately-offered investment vehicles set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 
We are organized as a holding company and conduct our businesses primarily through our majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof). We intend to conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of “investment securities.” We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we will not engage primarily, hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily, or propose to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we will be engaged primarily in the business of holding securities of our majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof). 
20

We expect that certain of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) may rely on the exclusion from the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which is available for entities “primarily engaged” in the business of “purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” This exclusion, as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires that an entity invest at least 55% of its assets in “qualifying real estate assets” and at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate assets and “real estate-related assets.” 
Although we reserve the right to modify our business methods at any time, as of December 31, 2018, we expect each of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to primarily hold assets in one or more of the following categories, which are comprised primarily of “qualifying real estate assets”: commercial mortgage loans, investments in securities secured by first mortgage loans, and investments in selected net leased and other real estate assets. We expect each of our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to rely on guidance published by the SEC or its staff or on our analyses of such guidance to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. To the extent that the SEC or its staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, we may be required to adjust our strategies accordingly. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in a subsidiary holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold. 
Any of the Company or our subsidiaries (including any series thereof) may rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(6) of the Investment Company Act to the extent that they primarily engage, directly or through majority-owned subsidiaries (including any series thereof), in the businesses described in Sections 3(c)(3), 3(c)(4) and 3(c)(5) of the Investment Company Act. The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategies accordingly. 
In 2011, the SEC solicited public comment on a wide range of issues relating to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the exemption and whether companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of such companies, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding Section 3(c)(5)(C), will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. 
Qualification for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act may limit our ability to make certain investments. In addition, complying with the tests for such exclusion may restrict the time at which we can acquire and sell assets. To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon such exclusions, we may be required to adjust our strategies accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC or its staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our Investment Company Act exemption—Maintenance of our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limits on our operations.”
