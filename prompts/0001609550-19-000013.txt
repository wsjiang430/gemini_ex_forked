Overview
We are a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative and minimally invasive solutions for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Our proprietary Inspire system is the first and only FDA-approved neurostimulation technology that provides a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. We have developed a novel, closed-loop solution that continuously monitors a patient’s breathing and delivers mild hypoglossal nerve stimulation to maintain an open airway. A significant body of clinical data, which includes a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine and more than 75 peer-reviewed publications, supports the safety and efficacy of Inspire therapy. Inspire therapy received premarket approval ("PMA") from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") in April 2014 and has been commercially available in certain European markets since November 2011. Inspire therapy is indicated for patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who do not have significant central sleep apnea and do not have a complete concentric collapse of the airway at the soft palate level. In addition, patients in the United States ("U.S.") must have been confirmed to fail or be unable to tolerate positive airway pressure treatments, such as CPAP, and be 22 years of age or older, though there are no similar requirements for patients in Europe. Physicians have treated more than 4,600 patients with Inspire therapy at over 245 medical centers across the U.S. and Europe.
Sleep apnea is a serious and chronic disease that negatively impacts a patient’s sleep, health and quality of life. Obstructive sleep apnea ("OSA") is the most common form of sleep apnea. OSA occurs when a person’s breathing is interrupted during sleep by a partially or completely blocked airway and affects patients of all ages, sexes and body types. The severity of OSA is measured by the number of partial or complete airway blockages that a patient experiences in an hour, referred to as the apnea-hypopnea index ("AHI"). Moderate OSA patients have an AHI of 15 to 30 events per hour, while severe OSA patients have an AHI of 30 more events per hour. Left untreated, OSA increases the risk of high blood pressure, hypertension, heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease and other life-threatening diseases.
Continuous positive airway pressure ("CPAP") is the leading therapy for patients with moderate to severe OSA. CPAP is delivered through a face or nasal mask that connects through a hose to a bedside air pump. In order for CPAP to be most effective, the mask must form an airtight seal on the patient’s face or nose and the mask must be worn every night. The effectiveness of CPAP has been limited by low patient compliance as many patients find the mask or treatment cumbersome, uncomfortable and loud. When CPAP fails or cannot be tolerated, patients’ remaining treatment options consist primarily of invasive surgical procedures developed to modify or remove existing tissue in an attempt to create free air flow. These invasive surgical procedures have limited or unpredictable clinical benefit, are irreversible, and can be extremely painful. We believe that there is both an urgent clinical need and a strong market opportunity for an alternative to CPAP that is effective and minimally invasive.
Inspire therapy is an innovative, closed-loop, minimally invasive solution that provides comfort and convenience, resulting in high compliance for patients with moderate to severe OSA. Once implanted, the Inspire system delivers electrical stimulation that causes a slight forward movement of the back of the tongue, which helps to maintain an open airway, enabling the patient to inhale freely without interruption. We believe our Inspire therapy provides the following benefits:
•Safe, effective and durable treatment supported by compelling clinical data, including long-term efficacy results out to five years from initial treatment.
•Closed-loop system that uses a proprietary algorithm to continuously monitor patients’ breathing and provide electrical stimulation during the inspiratory phase.
•Comfortable and convenient therapy resulting in high patient satisfaction that was reported to be 94% at an average of 12 months from initial treatment in the first 508 patients in our ongoing global patient registry.
•Strong patient compliance, with 80% of patients reporting continued nightly use through five years from initial treatment in our STAR trial.
•Minimally invasive outpatient procedure with short recovery time.
•Long-lasting solution with a battery designed to last approximately 11 years without charging or maintenance.
The results from multiple clinical trials, which include four sponsored and 13 independent clinical studies that evaluated approximately 1,470 patients, including approximately 770 patients evaluated in independent clinical studies, together with patient-reported outcomes, have shown that our Inspire therapy provides statistically significant and sustained reduction in the severity of patients’ OSA, improvement in sleep-related quality of life and reduction in snoring, as well as high patient compliance rates and a strong safety profile.
Our pivotal Stimulation Therapy for Apnea Reduction ("STAR") trial was designed to demonstrate longitudinal therapy efficacy and included a randomized controlled therapy withdrawal study. The longitudinal study demonstrated an approximately 70% reduction in the median AHI in patients with moderate to severe OSA from a baseline of 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour at 12 months following initial treatment. Ongoing STAR trial follow-up has shown results similar to the initial data at 18 months, three years and five years. At five years, median AHI in patients with moderate to severe OSA remained low at 6.2 events per hour. The effectiveness of Inspire therapy was further demonstrated by the results of the randomized controlled therapy withdrawal study, in which patients in the therapy withdrawal group regressed to near-baseline AHI levels while patients in the control group that continued therapy experienced sustained therapeutic benefits.
We sell our Inspire system to hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers ("ASCs") in the U.S. and in select countries in Europe through a direct sales organization. As of December 31, 2018, we had 46 sales representatives in the U.S. and six in Europe. Our direct sales force engages in sales efforts and promotional activities focused on ear, nose and throat ("ENT") physicians and sleep centers. In addition, we highlight our compelling clinical data and value proposition to increase awareness and adoption amongst referring physicians. We build upon this top-down approach with strong direct-to-patient marketing initiatives to create awareness of the benefits of our Inspire system and drive demand through patient empowerment. This outreach helps to educate thousands of patients on our Inspire therapy and frequently results in patient leads.
Our customers are reimbursed the cost required to treat each patient through various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies. We are in active discussions with commercial payors to establish positive national coverage policies to support reimbursement of Inspire therapy. In July 2018, Aetna Inc., one of the leading health plans in the U.S., began providing coverage for our Inspire therapy. In January 2019, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's (“BCBSA”) Evidence Street, which performs healthcare technology assessments for the 36 BCBSA insurers, issued a positive assessment of Inspire therapy to its members. We have secured positive coverage policies with 18 U.S. commercial payors, representing approximately 45 million covered lives. In parallel, our 16 person reimbursement team, which we refer to as our market access team, is focused on assisting patients and physicians in obtaining appropriate prior authorization approvals from commercial payors on a case-by-case basis in advance of treatment with our Inspire therapy. We have been successful in obtaining prior authorization approvals from approximately 330 commercial payors. In addition, Medicare may cover our procedure on a medical necessity basis. We also have a U.S. government contract for patients who are treated by the Veterans Health Administration.
We generated revenue of $50.6 million, with a gross margin of 80.1% and a net loss of $21.8 million, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, compared to revenue of $28.6 million, with a gross margin of 78.9% and a net loss of $17.5 million, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and revenue of $16.4 million, with a gross margin of 76.2% and a net loss of $18.5 million, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2018 was $146.9 million.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following competitive strengths:
•First to market with an innovative, closed-loop, minimally invasive solution. We have developed the first and only FDA-approved neurostimulation technology that provides a safe and effective treatment for patients with moderate to severe OSA who have been confirmed to fail or cannot tolerate positive airway pressure treatments, such as CPAP. We received a PMA from the FDA in April 2014 for our Inspire therapy. Unlike CPAP, which is limited by low patient compliance primarily due to patient discomfort with the mask or device, our innovative, closed-loop, minimally invasive solution is designed to provide comfort and convenience, resulting in high compliance for patients with moderate to severe OSA. We believe we have a significant first mover advantage and momentum over future competitors, as physicians have treated more than 4,600 patients with Inspire therapy.
•Significant body of strong clinical data. We have developed a significant body of clinical data that demonstrates the safety and effectiveness, therapy adherence and long-term sustained benefits of our Inspire therapy. The benefits of treatment with Inspire therapy have been consistent across four sponsored and 13 independent clinical studies that evaluated approximately 1,470 patients, including approximately 770 patients evaluated in independent clinical studies, and have been highlighted in more than 75 peer-reviewed publications. Data reported in these clinical studies also demonstrated a high level of overall patient satisfaction. We believe this favorable data provides us with a significant competitive advantage and will continue to support increased adoption of our Inspire therapy.
•Holistic and targeted approach to market development and patient engagement. We have established a methodical approach to market development which centers on active engagement across three key stakeholders in the OSA treatment paradigm-physicians, sleep centers and patients. Our sales force is focused on building long-lasting relationships with ENT physicians and sleep centers as we support physicians through all aspects of a case-from diagnosis to surgical support to patient follow-up. In addition, we are highlighting our compelling clinical data set and value proposition to increase awareness and adoption amongst referring physicians. We build upon this top-down approach with a strong direct-to-patient marketing initiative that further drives demand through patient empowerment. This outreach helps to educate thousands of patients on our Inspire therapy and frequently results in patient leads. We are confident that this holistic approach to engagement across multiple constituents will continue to drive increased awareness of and demand for our Inspire therapy.
•Dedicated team focused on providing market access for patients and providers. We have a highly efficient approach to advance patients, once identified, to placement of the Inspire system. Our dedicated market access team helps patients and providers work with payors to secure the appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of initial treatment. In addition, this team proactively works with payors to establish positive coverage policies by highlighting the compelling clinical data and the economic benefit of our Inspire therapy. This highly leverageable team has been successful in helping to secure reimbursement from approximately 330 commercial payors to date, and positive coverage policies from 18 U.S. commercial payors, including Aetna, Inc., one of the leading health plans in the U.S.
•Strong research and development capabilities and comprehensive intellectual property portfolio. Our commitment to driving innovation has allowed us to achieve continuous, significant improvements of our Inspire therapy. For example, in the U.S., in July 2017, and in Europe, in May 2018, we launched the fourth generation of our Inspire system, with a neurostimulator that is 40% smaller and 18% thinner than the neurostimulator in the previous generation, while maintaining an approximate 11-year battery life without needing to be recharged. Patients treated with this fourth generation device may now undergo an MRI scan of the head or extremities. In October 2018, the first implant of our new sensing lead was successfully completed in Germany, and in January 2019, the FDA approved the new sensing lead. This new lead has a significantly smaller profile, including a reduction in diameter of 49 percent, as compared to the prior design, and is intended to improve the patient’s comfort. It also incorporates several features to enable easier implanting and potentially reduce surgical time for an ENT surgeon. We have a comprehensive patent portfolio to protect our intellectual property and technology, with rights as of December 31, 2018 to 22 issued U.S. patents, 23 issued foreign patents, 28 pending U.S. patent applications and 41 pending foreign patent applications that cover aspects of our Inspire system and future product concepts.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be a global leader in providing clinically proven innovative solutions that improve sleep, quality of life and health of patients with moderate to severe OSA. We believe the following strategies will play a critical role in achieving this goal and our future growth:
•Promote awareness among patients, ENT physicians, sleep centers and referring physicians. We believe that many patients who have failed or cannot tolerate CPAP are unaware of our Inspire therapy as a safe and effective alternative treatment for moderate to severe OSA. We intend to continue to promote awareness of our therapy through training and educating ENT physicians, sleep centers, key opinion leaders and various medical societies on the proven clinical benefits of Inspire therapy. In addition, we intend to continue to publish additional clinical data in various industry and scientific journals and online and to present at various industry conferences. We also plan to continue building patient awareness through our direct-to-patient marketing initiatives, which include paid search, radio, social media and online videos.
•Expand our U.S. sales and marketing organization to drive adoption of our Inspire therapy. We plan to expand our sales and marketing organization and seek to recruit and train exceptionally talented sales representatives in existing and new markets in the U.S. to help facilitate further adoption and broaden awareness of our Inspire therapy. Our success to date in developing new markets has been primarily due to our ability to identify new regions with high volume medical centers, educate ENT and sleep physicians, help generate steady patient demand and provide sufficient support staff to our sales representatives. We believe investing in a scalable, efficient direct sales force and continuing the development of our marketing efforts will help us broaden adoption of our Inspire therapy and drive revenue growth.
•Leverage our prior authorization model while we work with payors to broaden coverage. Our dedicated in-house market access team will continue to assist patients and physicians in obtaining prior authorization approvals from commercial payors for treatment with our Inspire therapy. In parallel, we are in active discussions with commercial payors to establish positive national coverage policies and continue to highlight our compelling and robust clinical data, the economic cost savings associated with highly compliant OSA treatment and our increased support from leading medical organizations and key opinion leaders. We believe increased positive payor coverage policies could substantially expand patient access by reducing hurdles to treatment.
•Invest in research and development to drive innovation and expand indications. Our foundational commitment to driving innovation and improving patient lives fuels our desire for continuous product development. We intend to invest in existing and next generation technologies to further improve our products and clinical outcomes, optimize patient acceptance and comfort and broaden the patient population that can benefit from our Inspire therapy. An example of our efforts to expand our label indications includes our clinical study that is evaluating the use of Inspire therapy in pediatric patients with Down syndrome.
•Further penetrate and expand into existing and new international markets. We plan to establish and strengthen our presence internationally. Our goal is to further increase sales of our Inspire therapy in existing international markets in Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands, and expand our reach to new markets, such as Japan and Australia. We plan to strategically invest in new markets based on our assessment of market size and opportunity and prospects for compelling reimbursement coding and coverage.
Our Solution for OSA
Overview of Inspire Therapy
Our proprietary Inspire system is the first and only FDA-approved closed-loop neurostimulation technology that provides a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe OSA. Our Inspire system consists of a remote control and three implantable components:
•a pressure sensing lead, which detects when the patient is attempting to breathe;
•a neurostimulator, which houses the electronics and battery power for the device; and
•a stimulation lead, which delivers electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve.
The image below depicts the location of the Inspire system under the patient’s skin:
A pressure sensing lead is used to monitor the patient’s breathing. Our proprietary algorithm tracks breathing patterns and the neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulation at the start of inspiration. This electrical stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve causes a slight forward movement of the back of the tongue that helps maintain an open airway, thereby preventing obstructive events and enabling the patient to inhale freely.
To receive the Inspire system, patients undergo a short outpatient surgical procedure, typically lasting two hours, during which the neurostimulator, sensing lead and stimulation lead are implanted. The procedure is minimally invasive and performed with a series of three small incisions. Patients typically recover quickly and are able to resume normal activities in just a few days. Initial activation of the system occurs 30 days after the implantation. After the initial activation, the patient is instructed to use the therapy each night by turning on their Inspire system before going to sleep using their remote control.
The following pictures depict the Inspire neurostimulator and patient remote control, shown with a quarter for scale.
Patients turn their Inspire system on when they plan to go to sleep and turn it off when they awaken. The device has a programmed delay, typically 30 minutes, to allow patients to fall asleep naturally before the device activates. It then monitors the patient’s breathing and delivers mild stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve at the start of the inspiratory phase, causing a
 slight forward movement at the back of the tongue to maintain an open airway during the inspiratory phase of respiration. The therapy is designed to provide stimulation for each breath to prevent obstructive events.
The following pictures depict the anatomy of a patient experiencing an OSA event. The patient’s soft palate and the base of the patient’s tongue are obstructing the patient’s airway and limiting airflow to the lungs.
Obstructed Airway
The following pictures depict the anatomy of the patient after mild stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve, which caused the patient's tongue to move forward slightly, opening the patient's airway and restoring airflow to the lungs.
Open Airway
The effectiveness of Inspire therapy to relieve OSA is objectively measured during a sleep study or polysomnogram. A sleep study records a patient’s breathing, airflow and blood oxygen levels before and after activating the device. Before activation, the patient experiences multiple periods of interrupted breathing, and oxygen levels repeatedly drop before the patient experiences a transient arousal that allows air intake. The polysomnogram below shows that after activating Inspire therapy, the patient exhibited a more regular breathing pattern, higher and more consistent blood oxygen levels, and fewer or no transient arousals.
Polysomnogram Before and After Activation of Inspire System
Benefits of Inspire Therapy
We believe our Inspire therapy overcomes many of the limitations of CPAP and other current treatments of moderate to severe OSA by providing the following key benefits:
•Safe, effective and durable treatment. Results from our clinical trials provide compelling safety and efficacy data regarding the clinical benefits of Inspire therapy as many as five years after initial treatment. The results from our STAR trial, a five-year follow-up phase III pivotal trial, demonstrated an approximately 70% reduction in the median AHI from a baseline of 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour at 12 months following initial treatment. Ongoing STAR trial follow-up has shown similar results to the initial data at 18 months, three years and five years. At five years, median AHI remained low at 6.2 events per hour.
•Closed-loop system. The Inspire system uses a proprietary algorithm to continuously monitor a patient’s breathing and provide electrical stimulation during the inspiratory phase, working with the body’s natural actions to keep the airway open during the breathing cycle.
•Comfortable and convenient therapy resulting in high patient satisfaction. Data reported on the first 508 patients in our ongoing ADHERE patient registry, which we established to follow patients who have been implanted with an Inspire system, demonstrated that these patients used Inspire therapy an average of 5.7 hours per night an average of 12 months after initial treatment, with overall patient satisfaction reported to be at 94%.
•Strong patient compliance. Results from our STAR trial demonstrated that 80% of patients continue to use Inspire therapy on a nightly basis five years after initial treatment.
•Minimally invasive outpatient procedure. The Inspire system’s implantable components are placed during an approximately two-hour outpatient procedure. The procedure is minimally invasive and performed with three small incisions. Patients typically recover quickly and are able to resume normal activities within a few days.
•Long-lasting solution. Our Inspire system uses a battery designed to last approximately 11 years without charging or maintenance.
Commercialization of Inspire Therapy
In the U.S., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, new claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we must first receive FDA clearance. We obtained PMA approval for our Inspire system in 2014. Additionally, we received a CE mark for commercialization of our Inspire system in Europe in 2011, and in June 2018, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved our Inspire therapy to treat moderate to severe OSA. To commercialize our Inspire system, both in the U.S. and Europe, we focus on physician and patient awareness and adoption of our Inspire therapy. To achieve this, our commercialization strategy primarily consists of our direct sales force engaging in sales efforts and promotional activities focused on ENT physicians and sleep centers and highlighting our compelling clinical data and value proposition. Our direct sales force utilizes strong direct-to-patient marketing initiatives to create awareness of the benefits of our Inspire system. We intend to make significant investments building our sales and marketing organization by increasing the number of U.S. sales representatives and continuing our direct-to-patient marketing efforts in existing and new markets throughout the U.S., Europe and Japan.
In addition, a significant part of our commercialization effort consists of supporting our customers through the reimbursement process. Our Inspire system is currently reimbursed primarily on a per-patient prior authorization basis for patients covered by commercial payors, on a medical necessity basis for most patients covered by Medicare, and under U.S. government contract for patients who are treated by the Veterans Health Administration. We have also secured positive coverage policies from 18 U.S. commercial payors, including Aetna Inc., one of the leading health plans in the U.S, and in January 2019, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Evidence Street issued a positive assessment of Inspire therapy to its members. Our ability to continue to successfully commercialize our Inspire system will depend in large part on our ability to leverage our prior authorization model while we work with commercial payors to create new positive coverage policies in each market in which we operate.
Treatment with Inspire Therapy
Patient Selection
Inspire therapy is indicated for patients with moderate to severe OSA (AHI of 15 to 65) who do not have significant CSA and do not have a complete concentric collapse of the airway at the soft palate level. Patients undergo a drug-induced sleep endoscopy performed by an ENT surgeon in order to confirm that they satisfy this anatomical requirement. In addition, patients in the U.S. must have been confirmed to fail or be unable to tolerate positive airway pressure treatments, such as CPAP, and be 22 years of age or older, though there are no similar requirements for patients in Europe. Patients who fail positive airway pressure ("PAP") are those that are not able to eliminate moderate to severe OSA despite PAP usage. Patients who cannot tolerate PAP treatments are those who either are unable to use PAP more than five nights per week for at least four hours per night, or who are unwilling to use PAP treatment. We have submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA to expand our indication in the U.S. to patients as young as 12 years of age, which is currently under review.
Implantation
The Inspire system is implanted under general anesthesia through three small incisions. One incision is under the lower jaw, where the stimulation lead is attached around a distal branch of the hypoglossal nerve that is responsible for forward movement of the tongue. A second incision in the upper right chest below the clavicle is used to implant the neurostimulator, which houses all the electronics and battery power for the device. The last incision is made near the ribs, where a pressure sensing lead is placed to monitor the breathing cycle. The functionality of the Inspire system is tested in the operating room to verify proper placement of the stimulation and pressure sensing leads. The wires for the electrodes are tunneled under the skin and the incisions are closed. The Inspire system is powered by a battery in the neurostimulator that is designed to last approximately 11 years without needing to be recharged. After this time, the neurostimulator is replaced during a simple outpatient procedure.
The implantation procedure is performed in an outpatient setting and surgery is completed in approximately two hours. Patients may experience mild discomfort and swelling at the incision sites for a few days that is usually managed with over-the-counter pain medications. Patients can return home and resume a normal diet shortly after completion of the procedure and resume most daily activities within a few days. The only restriction on their activity is to avoid strenuous activities until the incisions have had time to heal.
Activation
Patients are allowed to heal for a month before the Inspire system is activated through a wireless connection to the device in the clinician’s office. The initial activation is performed by the clinician using a programming tablet that is able to turn the system on as well as change various parameters such as the strength of the stimulating pulse, the sensitivity of the detection, the timing and length of the pulse, and which part of the stimulating electrode should be used. With the exception of pulse strength, the factory default settings are used in the majority of patients. The pulse strength is initially adjusted to the lowest level required to move the tongue out of the way without causing discomfort.
Patients receive a remote control that they use to turn their Inspire system on when they plan to go to sleep and to turn it off when they awaken. The device has a programmed delay, typically 30 minutes, to allow patients to fall asleep naturally before the device activates. It then delivers mild stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve, causing the tongue to move as the patient is inhaling. The remote enables patients to adjust the strength of the stimulation to optimize their therapy and comfort. The range of control given to patients is limited to avoid setting the strength of the stimulation to an ineffective or excessively high level. Patients also have the ability to temporarily pause therapy if they awaken during the night.
Clinical Results and Studies
A significant body of published clinical evidence, which includes four sponsored and 13 independent clinical studies that evaluated approximately 1,470 patients, including approximately 770 patients evaluated in independent clinical studies, supports the safety and effectiveness of our Inspire therapy. The results of the STAR trial, our phase III pivotal clinical trial that served as the basis for the FDA approval of our PMA application, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and the results of additional clinical studies have been published in more than 75 peer-reviewed publications. We have established a global patient registry, which we refer to as our ADHERE patient registry, to collect data on safety, effectiveness, weekly usage, overall compliance and satisfaction from patients who have been implanted with an Inspire system. The table below highlights key findings from certain of these studies and data from the first 508 patients in our ADHERE patient registry, including significant improvements in objective sleep measures and patient-reported quality of life measures, strong therapy compliance and a favorable safety profile.

STAR Trial
Overview
We sponsored the STAR trial, a multi-center, prospective, single-group, cohort design study that began in 2010 at 22 medical centers across the U.S. and Europe. We evaluated 126 patients who were confirmed to fail or were unable to tolerate positive airway treatments, such as CPAP. Of the 126 patients, 83% were men, the mean age was 54.5 years and the mean body-mass index was 28.4.
The primary outcome measures were a reduction in AHI from baseline to 12 months of more than 50% along with final AHI being less than 20 events per hour, and a reduction from baseline to 12 months of more than 50% in oxygen desaturation index ("ODI") which measures the number of times per hour of sleep that the blood’s oxygen level drops by at least 4% below baseline. These are objective quantitative metrics that are measured during an in-office sleep study or polysomnogram, which also provides important objective measures of sleep quality.
Secondary outcome measures evaluated a patient’s quality of life using two standard and validated patient questionnaires, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire ("FOSQ") and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ("ESS"). A clinically relevant improvement in FOSQ is 2.0 points from baseline, and a normalized patient has a FOSQ score greater than 17.9. ESS scores of 10 or greater reflect excessive daytime sleepiness. An additional secondary outcome measured the percentage of sleep time during which a patient’s blood oxygen saturation level was below 90%.
After 12 months, 46 consecutive patients who met the criteria of having a response to therapy were then included in a randomized, controlled therapy-withdrawal trial. These patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a therapy-withdrawal group, which had the device turned off for at least five days until a sleep study or polysomnogram was performed, or to a therapy-maintenance group, which continued nightly use of the device.
We have continued to follow patients from the STAR trial to collect data regarding long-term efficacy and utilization. See “-Long-Term Benefits of Inspire Therapy.”
Results
The results of the STAR trial were initially published in January 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The trial met both of its primary endpoints at 12 months, as well as all secondary endpoints.
The median AHI for patients in the STAR trial decreased from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour at 12 months (p<0.001). The median ODI decreased from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour (p<0.001). Patients reported significantly improved quality of life based on the FOSQ, on which median scores increased from 14.6 to 18.2 out of a maximum score of 20 (p<0.001). Patients also had less daytime sleepiness as quantified by a decrease in the median ESS from 11.0 to 6.0 (p<0.001). In the trial, the percentage of sleep time during which a patient’s blood oxygen saturation levels was below 90% was reduced from 5.4% to 0.9% at 12 months (p=0.01).
Inspire therapy efficacy data from STAR trial at 12 months
After 12 months’ follow-up with 126 implanted patients, 124 patients (98%) remained active users of our Inspire therapy. One patient died unexpectedly due to an unrelated cause, and one participant requested a device removal for personal reasons because the patient was a non-responder. Data at 12 months showed that 86% of patients (106 of 123) used the device daily and 93% (115 of 123) used the device at least five days a week, with data unavailable from one patient.
The effectiveness of Inspire therapy was further demonstrated by the results of the therapy-withdrawal portion of the trial, which showed a significant difference between the therapy-withdrawal group and the therapy-maintenance group with respect to the change in the AHI score from the assessment at 12 months of the cohort study to the assessment at the end of the therapy-withdrawal study. As illustrated in the charts below, a difference in change in mean scores of 16.4 events per hour was observed (p<0.001), and a similar effect was observed for the mean ODI scores.

Safety
Patients from the STAR trial reported various adverse events, typically mild and resolved within five days, which can be divided into two categories. The first category includes those occurring immediately subsequent to the implantation procedure. In this category, 26% of patients reported incision pain and 25% reported post-operative discomfort. There was only one report of a mild infection associated with the procedure. The second category includes device-related adverse events that were reported in the first 18 months after implantation. In this category, 47% of patients reported discomfort due to stimulation at some point during this period, which was generally resolved with programming adjustments to the device. Other common reports included tongue abrasion, headaches and mouth dryness.
Explants and Revisions
Two patients out of 126 in the STAR trial did not complete the trial. One patient died unexpectedly due to an unrelated cause, and one patient requested a device removal because the patient was a non-responder. Two other patients underwent revision surgeries to reposition the device to address patient discomfort.
Long-term Benefits of Inspire Therapy
Patients receiving Inspire therapy in the STAR trial have been followed for long-term efficacy and utilization. The median AHI in these patients decreased from 29.3 events per hour to 9.0 events per hour after 12 months and the median ODI decreased from 25.4 events per hour to 7.4 events per hour after 12 months. After five years, the median AHI in these patients was 6.2 events per hour and the median ODI was 4.6 events per hour, as shown below.
Patient-reported outcomes after five years also found a roughly 45% improvement and a roughly 28% improvement in daytime sleepiness as measured by ESS and FOSQ, respectively, and 80% of patients reported nightly usage. These results are shown below.
After five years, approximately 90% of patients reported no or only soft snoring, compared to only 17% at baseline. Before obtaining therapy, 30% of patients reported that their bed partners occasionally had to leave the room because of their snoring. After five years of therapy, this number decreased to 1%.
German Post-Market Study
We sponsored the German Post-Market Study, a multi-center post-approval study that evaluated 60 middle-aged, overweight patients, with measurements at two-, six- and 12-month intervals. The results of this study, which were published in The Laryngoscope in 2017, were consistent with the outcomes demonstrated in our STAR trial and showed median AHI being reduced from a baseline of 28.6 events per hour to 9.5 events per hour in 56 patients measured after 12 months. Over the same period, median ESS score improved from a baseline of 13.0 to 6.5 and median FOSQ score improved from a baseline of 13.7 to 18.6. There were three patients lost to follow-up and one patient requested removal of the device for cosmetic and other personal reasons. There were no serious device-related adverse events.
ADHERE Patient Registry
We established our ADHERE patient registry to follow patients who have been implanted with an Inspire system, with a goal of collecting data on a group of at least 2,500 patients. Data gathered to date on the first 508 patients published in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery in 2018 showed that patients used Inspire therapy an average of 5.7 hours per night when measured an average of 12 months after implantation. Median AHI was reduced from 34.0 events per hour to 7.0 events per hour and median ESS score improved from 12 to 7 over the same period. Overall satisfaction with Inspire therapy was reported by patients to be 94%, with 94% of patients reporting that they would choose the procedure again. In addition, 96% of patients reported a better experience than CPAP.
Independent Evaluations of Inspire Therapy
As the adoption of Inspire therapy continues to expand, many implanting centers have conducted and/or will conduct their own independent studies.
The effectiveness of our Inspire therapy has been documented by researchers at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital ("TJUH") and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center ("UPMC") who published their results in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine in 2017. These researchers found that AHI decreased from a mean of over 35 events per hour to approximately six events per hour at both institutions after three months, in a group of 97 patients with a mean age of approximately 62 years and a mean body-mass index ("BMI") of approximately 28.5. Mean ESS scores also improved significantly at both institutions, as shown below. Patients at both institutions used the device for an average of more than 45 hours per week and more than 75% of patients used the device longer than 40 hours per week. One patient in the study requested removal of the device due to perceived lack of symptomatic improvement.
Positive results have been reported from a number of other independent studies to date, including:
•The University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center reported in Clinical Otolaryngology on 20 patients who received Inspire therapy. The mean decrease of AHI was 30.2 events/hour and the mean increase of the minimum SpO2 was 4.3%. The mean therapy usage was 46 hours per week.
•Dr. Huntley et al reported a case-control, retrospective review of 153 patients who received Inspire therapy at two academic institutes in The Laryngoscope. The AHI reduced from 34.7 to 5.6 among patients with BMI less than 32, and from 41.0 to 6.5 among patients with BMI of more than 32, showing no difference in AHI response among patients with elevated BMI comparing with patients with lower BMI.
•Dr. Zhu et al reported in Respiratory Medicine the effect of age among 62 patients who received Inspire therapy. Among 31 patients younger than 65 years, AHI reduced from 28.7 to 4.9 and ESS reduced from 14.6 to 4.0. Among 31 patients older than 65 years, AHI reduced from 28.5 to 9.2 and ESS reduced from 12.0 to 5.5 at 12 months. There were no differences in therapy response between the two ago groups. Advanced age was not a limiting factor for patients to receive the benefit of Inspire therapy.
•At a non-academic hospital in San Diego, Dr. Weeks reported in in Laryngoscope Investigative Otolaryngology on 22 consecutive patients treated with Inspire therapy. Implant times for these patients averaged 171±40 minutes. All implantations were completed without complications and AHI reductions were consistent among patients, with all patients measured achieving a titrated AHI < 5. Average device use was 7.0±1.0 hours/night.
Comparison of Inspire Therapy and UPPP
Cleveland Clinic Study
A retrospective study comparing the effectiveness of hypoglossal nerve stimulation ("HNS") therapy utilizing our Inspire system to the effectiveness of UPPP was conducted by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic on two cohorts of patients treated
 for OSA. A cohort of 20 patients, with a mean age at the time of surgery of 42.1 and mean BMI of 27.5, underwent traditional UPPP airway reconstructive surgery, while a cohort of 20 patients, with a mean age at the time of surgery of 62.4 and mean BMI of 28.0, were treated with Inspire therapy. A higher percentage of patients who received Inspire therapy (65%) achieved reduction in AHI from the moderate to severe range into the normal range (defined as AHI <5) compared to patients who underwent UPPP (20%). Additionally, mean AHI for patients treated with Inspire therapy decreased by 88% while mean AHI for patients treated with UPPP decreased by 29%.
Thomas Jefferson University Hospital Study
An additional study comparing the effectiveness of our Inspire therapy to the effectiveness of UPPP was conducted by researchers at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital on two cohorts of patients treated for OSA. A cohort of 33 patients, with a mean age of 43.5 and mean BMI of 29.6, underwent expansion sphincteroplasty, a variant of UPPP, while a cohort of 90 patients, with a mean age of 61.2 and mean BMI of 29.8, were treated with Inspire therapy. A higher percentage of patients who received Inspire therapy (88%) were successfully treated compared to patients who received UPPP (64%), with successful treatment defined as a reduction in AHI of at least 50% from baseline and achieving an AHI of less than 20 events per hour.
Sales and Marketing
We have established a methodical approach to market development which centers on active engagement across three key stakeholders in the OSA treatment paradigm-patients, physicians and sleep centers.
We sell our Inspire system through a direct sales force that primarily targets ENT physicians and sleep centers in the U.S. and Europe. The implant procedure for our Inspire therapy is typically performed by an ENT physician or in some cases by neurosurgeons. We also focus on sleep centers because they diagnose and manage large volumes of patients with sleep apnea and are often an important referral base for ENT physicians. In addition, because OSA is sometimes diagnosed during other
 procedures, we have developed programs to help educate general practitioners and specialists in other fields, such as cardiovascular surgeons, electrophysiologists and dentists, regarding our Inspire therapy.
We have 46 sales representatives, which we refer to as territory managers, in the U.S. and six in Europe. We seek to recruit territory managers with strong sales backgrounds, direct experience developing markets with new technologies and core knowledge of medical device coding, reimbursement and the prior authorization process.
We also utilize direct communication channels to inform and educate patients about Inspire therapy and to enable them to connect with active clinical sites that offer our Inspire systems. Our primary methods of patient outreach are Facebook, Google ad placements and radio advertisements (either local or satellite). The objective of this outreach is to bring patients to our website, where they can find educational materials and videos on sleep apnea and the use and benefits of our Inspire therapy, contact information for physicians and clinical sites and information regarding community awareness events.
We believe our patient outreach efforts have been effective in bringing potential patients to our website and facilitating contact with our clinical sites. During 2018, we received an average of approximately 46,000 individual hits to our website each week and had over 1.3 million “engaged” visitors, defined as visitors who went to at least two pages while visiting our website and remain on the site for at least 30 seconds. In 2018, we had close to 425,000 visitors who used our website to find a physician in their area, with more than 22,000 visitors calling a clinical site to schedule an appointment.
Commercial Activities Outside of the U.S.
We have six territory managers in Europe, five of whom are located in Germany. Our general practice is to limit commercial investments in European countries until such time as there is a determined reimbursement pathway. We provide consistent training in Europe as is conducted in the U.S. and have established a support team in Europe for patient outreach and education, implant support and device programming. We expect to continue to scale our commercial activities in Europe as we continue to develop country-wide reimbursement in additional markets.
Third-Party Reimbursement
Our market access team is responsible for all of our reimbursement processes and initiatives. Our team includes 16 professionals who are focused on all key aspects of reimbursement, which include coding, payment and coverage.
Coding and Payment
In the U.S., we sell our products to hospitals and ASCs. These customers in turn bill various third-party payors, such as commercial payors and government agencies, for the cost required to treat each patient.
Third-party payors require physicians and hospitals to identify the service for which they are seeking reimbursement by using Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") codes, which are created and maintained by the American Medical Association ("AMA"). Implantation of our Inspire neurostimulator and stimulation lead are described by CPT code 64568, which is the code describing the implantation of a cranial nerve stimulator. Implantation of our Inspire pressure sensing lead is described by CPT code 0466T, a Category III code published by the AMA in January 2017. Although the AMA declined to convert CPT code 0466T into a Category I CPT code in May 2018, we plan to resubmit an application to the AMA for the conversion of our pressure sensing lead’s CPT code from a temporary Category III CPT code into a permanent Category I CPT code.
Physician reimbursement under Medicare generally is based on a defined fee schedule, the Physician Fee Schedule, through which payment amounts are determined by the relative values of the professional service rendered. Medicare provides reimbursement to our hospital customers under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system ("HOPPS") which provides bundled amounts generally intended to reimburse the hospital for all facility costs related to procedures performed in the hospital outpatient setting. Under the HOPPS, the national average Medicare payment to the hospital for this procedure is approximately $27,700, which covers the hospitals’ costs for the device and the implantation procedure. The surgeon is reimbursed an additional physician payment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. Reimbursement rates from commercial payors vary depending on the procedure performed, the commercial payor, contract terms, and other factors.
Commercial Payor and Government Program Coverage
A core pillar of our reimbursement strategy involves broadening our third-party payor coverage. We continue to have active discussions with commercial payors to establish positive national coverage policies by highlighting our compelling and robust clinical data, the economic cost-savings associated with highly compliant OSA treatment, increased patient demand and support from leading medical societies and key opinion leaders. We have been successful in obtaining prior authorization approvals from over 330 commercial payors for the Inspire device and procedure. In 2018, commercial payors prior authorized approximately 60% of Inspire implants in the U.S. We have secured positive coverage policies from the following U.S. commercial payors:

∙ | Aetna Inc. | ∙ | Cleveland Clinic Health Plan 
∙ | Ascension Smart Health | ∙ | EmblemHealth 
∙ | AVMed | ∙ | Health Alliance Plan (HAP) of Michigan 
∙ | Blue Cross Blue Shield of Kansas | ∙ | Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey 
∙ | Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts | ∙ | Medica 
∙ | Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi | ∙ | Ohio State University Health Plan 
∙ | Blue Cross Blue Shield Regence | ∙ | Preferred One 
∙ | Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina | ∙ | Premera Blue Cross 
∙ | Blue Cross of Idaho | ∙ | WEA Trust and Group Health Cooperative of South Central Wisconsin

A number of other commercial payors currently consider hypoglossal nerve stimulation to be investigational, including procedures involving the Inspire system, and therefore do not have formal coverage policies.
Procedures involving our Inspire system may be reimbursed on a medical necessity basis for Medicare patients, though certain local Medicare contractors have not adopted positive coverage policies for procedures involving the Inspire system. In 2018, Medicare accounted for approximately 30% of all Inspire system implantations in the U.S., although we expect this percentage to decrease over time as commercial policies are developed. In addition, we have a contract with the U.S. government that covers implantations of our Inspire system performed in Veterans Affairs and military hospitals, which accounted for approximately 10% of all Inspire system implantations in 2018 in the U.S.
Prior Authorization Approval Process
A second pillar of our reimbursement strategy includes leveraging our market access team to assist patients and physicians in obtaining appropriate prior authorization approvals in advance of treatment on a case-by-case basis where positive coverage policies currently do not exist. We believe our market access team is highly effective in working with patients and physicians to obtain prior authorizations for our Inspire system including handling of the appeals process. In 2018, we received multiple prior authorization approvals from most of the largest commercial payors, for example UnitedHealth, Anthem, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Humana. In addition, in 2018, market access team helped approximately 75% of patients who pursued the appeals process fully to secure prior authorizations with an average approval time of approximately two to three months, with only approximately 15% being denied external medical review approval while the remainder were lost to follow-up. Our market access team supported more than 1,500 individual patient submissions in 2017 and approximately 2,500 individual patient submissions in 2018.
We believe we will continue to benefit from this efficient prior authorization process in the near-term and in the longer-term by expanding positive coverage policies. We intend to expand our market access team and increase the number of annual patient submissions as we grow our operations.
Reimbursement Outside of the U.S.
In Germany, the Institut für das Entgeltsystem im Krankenhaus, the German federal reimbursement agency, has granted the Neue Untersuchungs-und Behandlungsmethoden ("NUB") Status 1 coverage for our Inspire system. The NUB process allows for the introduction of new and innovative medical devices prior to reaching reimbursement eligibility and provides for a supplemental payment for new technologies in the German reimbursement system. NUB Status 1 is the highest of four levels and allows for full reimbursement for our Inspire system for the 84 hospitals that applied for therapy in 2018. Under NUB Status 1, payors at these hospitals are obligated to cover the gaps in treatment costs for the Inspire system.
In the Netherlands, the Zorginstituut, or the Dutch Health Institute, has approved Inspire therapy for conditional reimbursement within the basic package of all payors. This allows patients to receive the Inspire system in certain hospitals and within approved indications set by the Zorginstituut.
Reimbursement in European countries outside of Germany is primarily provided by single center hospitals from their operating budgets or with generic payment codes, but we intend to continue to develop reimbursement in other European countries including Belgium, France, the Nordic region and any other new market that we may enter in the future, such as Japan and Australia.
Research and Development
Product Evolution and Next Generation Products
The first Inspire device was developed by Medtronic Inc. (now Medtronic Public Limited Company), or Medtronic, in the early 1990s as a radio frequency controlled device that required an external apparatus to deliver electrical stimulation to the hypoglossal nerve. The first fully implantable, respiration-sensing, closed-loop Inspire system was developed shortly thereafter. Based on the initial clinical trial results, which were published in 2001, Medtronic began developing what became known as our Inspire II system, introducing a new, more durable stimulation lead and lower-power neurostimulator, and relocating the pressure sensing lead to between the intercostal muscle layers.
After our inception and the spin-off of the Inspire business from Medtronic in 2007, our primary focus was to requalify the Inspire II system and resume clinical trial activity. We completed a phase I feasibility trial along with a phase II dosing or patient selection trial in 2009. In 2011, we began our phase III pivotal STAR trial. The STAR trial was completed and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2014 and we received PMA approval in April 2014. Additionally, we received a CE mark for commercialization in Europe in 2011.
We continue to invest in advancing our Inspire system with the goal of providing patients more effective and less invasive therapy for OSA. In 2017, we released the Inspire IV neurostimulator, which is 40% smaller than the previous version while maintaining approximately 11 years of battery life. Patients with this version of the Inspire system are now able to undergo an MRI scan of the head or extremities. The Inspire IV device was launched in the U.S. in July 2017, and in Europe in the second quarter of 2018.
Our newly designed pressure sensing lead was developed in 2017 and was approved by the FDA in January 2019. This lead was introduced in Europe in October 2018, and we expect to introduce it to our U.S. medical center customers in March 2019. The lead has a significantly smaller profile, including a reduction in diameter of 49 percent as compared to the prior design. This smaller profile is intended to improve the patient’s comfort, and incorporates several features to enable easier implanting and potentially reduce surgical time for an ENT surgeon.
Our fifth generation of the Inspire neurostimulator is in the concept phase of development. We are also developing a cloud-based patient management system called Inspire Cloud, which is being designed to allow physicians to monitor patient compliance and therapy efficacy.
Additional Indications
We have sought and continue to seek to expand the approved indications for our Inspire therapy. For instance, in January 2017, the FDA approved a PMA supplement expanding the indicated AHI range for our Inspire therapy from 20 to 65 events per hour to 15 to 65 events per hour.
We have submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA to expand our indication in the U.S. to patients as young as 12 years of age. This expanded indication would also allow pediatric patients with Down syndrome to be treated with Inspire therapy. 
Patients born with Down syndrome have higher rates of OSA than the general pediatric population. The incidence rate can range from 30% to 60% in children with Down syndrome, compared to 1% in the general population. OSA remains a long-term disability in many of these individuals, and CPAP compliance in this patient population is significantly worse than in the general population. Results from a six-patient trial in adolescents with Down syndrome were published in 2017 in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery demonstrating the safety and efficacy of Inspire therapy for treating this patient
 population. Results from this investigator-initiated trial suggest that Inspire therapy may have therapeutic potential in Down syndrome patients.
Our research and development team focuses on the products currently under development, including our clinical trials, as well as feasibility studies in which we are evaluating different design configurations to enhance product functionality for future generations of the Inspire system.
Competition
Our industry is subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products and technologies and other activities of industry participants. We compete as a second-line therapy in the OSA treatment market for patients with moderate to severe OSA.
We consider our primary competition to be other neurostimulation technologies designed to treat OSA, though we are currently the only such technology approved for commercialization in the U.S. by the FDA. Outside the U.S., we compete with ImThera (now a part of LivaNova), which markets an open-loop neurostimulation device. ImThera is currently conducting clinical trials of its device in the U.S. We believe other emerging businesses are in the early stages of developing neurostimulation devices.
We also compete, both within and outside of the U.S., with invasive surgical treatment options such as UPPP, MMA and robotic tongue reduction surgery, and, to a lesser extent, oral appliances, which are primarily used in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA. We do not believe we directly compete with CPAP or other types of positive airway pressure devices because in the U.S., Inspire therapy is only indicated for patients who have been confirmed to fail or cannot tolerate positive airway pressure treatments, such as CPAP.
We believe that the primary competitive factors in the OSA treatment market are:
•company, product and brand recognition;
•product safety, reliability and durability;
•quality and volume of clinical data;
•effective marketing to and education of patients, physicians and sleep centers;
•product ease of use and patient comfort;
•sales force experience and access;
•product support and service;
•technological innovation, product enhancements and speed of innovation;
•pricing and revenue strategies;
•procedure costs to patients;
•effectiveness of reimbursement teams and strategies; and
•dedicated practice development and clinical training teams.
Most of the other OSA treatments against which we compete have a greater penetration into the OSA treatment market. Oral appliances and other surgical treatments are better known to ENT physicians, sleep centers and the other physicians on whom we rely for referrals, but we believe physician awareness of our Inspire therapy is increasing.
We also compete with other medical technology companies to recruit and retain qualified sales, training and other personnel, including members of our in-house prior authorization team.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2018, we had rights to 22 issued U.S. patents, which will expire between 2019 and 2035 assuming all required fees are paid, 28 pending U.S. patent applications, 23 issued foreign patents and 41 pending foreign patent applications. Our patents cover aspects of our current Inspire system and future product concepts. Some of the issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications preserve an opportunity to pursue patent rights in multiple countries.
There is no active patent litigation involving any of our patents and we have not received any notices of patent infringement.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 47 pending and registered trademark filings worldwide, some of which may apply to multiple countries.
We also rely, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may in the future rely upon licensing opportunities, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality and assignment agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information.
Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents will protect our intellectual property rights or provide us with any competitive advantage. While there is no active litigation involving any of our patents or other intellectual property rights and we have not received any notices of patent infringement, we may be required to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights against third parties in the future. See Part I., "Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property Matters” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
License Agreement with Medtronic
In November 2007, we entered into an assignment and license agreement with Medtronic, ("the Assignment and License Agreement") pursuant to which Medtronic assigned certain patents and trademarks to us and granted to us a worldwide, royalty-free license to certain other patents and technical information to make, use, import and sell products and to practice methods in the field of electrical stimulation of the upper airway for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ("the Field"). We share co-exclusive rights with Medtronic under this license; however, Medtronic may not exercise its rights unless we make an assignment for the benefit of our creditors, file or have filed against us a bankruptcy petition or go into receivership. We also granted to Medtronic certain worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive licenses to the patents Medtronic assigned to us, as well as other intellectual property (including but not limited to Technical Information (as defined in the Assignment and License Agreement)) that applies to a device and methods with certain specifications for use in the Field, to make, use, import and sell products and to practice methods outside of the Field. The licenses granted are perpetual and irrevocable.
Manufacturing and Supply
We rely on third-party suppliers to manufacture our Inspire system and its components. Outsourcing manufacturing reduces our need for capital investment and reduces operational expense. Additionally, outsourcing provides expertise and capacity necessary to scale up or down based on demand for our Inspire system. We select our suppliers to ensure that our Inspire system and its components are safe and effective, adhere to all applicable regulations, are of the highest quality, and meet our supply needs. We employ a rigorous supplier assessment, qualification, and selection process targeted to suppliers that meet the requirements of the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures. Our quality assurance process monitors and maintains supplier performance through qualification and periodic supplier reviews and audits.
Certain components used in our Inspire system are supplied by single-source suppliers. Our suppliers manufacture the components they produce for us and test our components and devices to our specifications. We intend to maintain sufficient
 levels of inventory to enable us to continue our operations while we obtain another supplier in the event that one or more of our single-source suppliers were to encounter a delay in supply or end supply.
Government Regulation 
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities in the U.S., as well as comparable authorities in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Our products are subject to regulation as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, import, export, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
In addition to U.S. regulations, we are subject to a variety of regulations in the EEA governing clinical trials and the commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we have or are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval for a product, we will be required to obtain authorization before commencing clinical trials and to obtain marketing authorization or approval of our products under the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials or commercialize our products in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the U.S. requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or PMA approval. Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or another commercially available device that was cleared to through the 510(k) process.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
Our currently marketed Inspire products are Class III devices which have received PMA approval.
PMA Approval Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the
 application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a preapproval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation ("QSR").
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of investigational devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption ("IDE") regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board ("IRB") for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must
 be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
•the federal Physician Sunshine Act and various state and foreign laws on reporting remunerative relationships with health care customers;
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not have to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
•the federal False Claims Act (and similar state laws) prohibiting, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing, or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing, an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government. The government may assert that claim includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statute;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of a supplement for certain modifications to PMA devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR or other applicable regulatory requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
•criminal prosecution.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the EEA 
There is currently no premarket government review of medical devices in the EEA (which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union ("E.U.") plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland). However, all medical devices placed on the market in the EEA must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices ("the Medical Devices Directive"). There is also a directive specifically addressing Active Implantable Medical Devices (Directive 90/385/EEC). The most fundamental essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment, and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest
 way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter. Compliance with a standard developed to implement an essential requirement also creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body. Notified bodies are often separate entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. The notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EEA. Once the product has been placed on the market in the EEA, the manufacturer must comply with requirements for reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions associated with the medical device.
In order to demonstrate safety and efficacy for their medical devices, manufacturers must conduct clinical investigations in accordance with the requirements of Annex X to the Medical Devices Directive, Annex 7 of the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive, and applicable European and International Organization for Standardization standards, as implemented or adopted in the EEA member states. Clinical trials for medical devices usually require the approval of an ethics review board and approval by or notification to the national regulatory authorities. Both regulators and ethics committees also require the submission of serious adverse event reports during a study and may request a copy of the final study report.
On April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the E.U. Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EEA member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member State laws implementing them, in all EEA member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member States. The Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The Medical Devices Regulation will however only become applicable three years after publication (in 2020). Once applicable, the new regulations will among other things:
•strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
•establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
•improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;
•set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the E.U.;
•strengthened rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market.
We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of:
•design, development, manufacturing and testing;
•product standards;
•product safety;
•product safety reporting;
•marketing, sales and distribution;
•packaging and storage requirements;
•labeling requirements;
•content and language of instructions for use;
•clinical trials;
•record keeping procedures;
•advertising and promotion;
•recalls and field corrective actions;
•post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
•import and export restrictions;
•tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements;
•registration for reimbursement; and
•necessity of testing performed in country by distributors for licensees.
The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse and Physician Payment Transparency Laws 
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing and promotion of drugs and devices, other federal and state laws restrict our business practices. These laws include, without limitation, foreign, federal, and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including stock, stock options, and the compensation derived through ownership interests.
Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the DHHS issued regulations in July 1991, which the Department has referred to as “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions which, if met in form and substance, will assure medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Additional safe harbor provisions providing similar protections have been published intermittently since 1991. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Our arrangements with physicians, hospitals and other persons or entities who are in a position to refer may not fully meet the stringent criteria specified in the various safe harbors. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal
 Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (described below).
Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in civil monetary penalties up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved. Civil penalties for such conduct can further be assessed under the federal False Claims Act. Violations can also result in criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to 10 years. Similarly, violations can result in exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Liability under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also arise because of the intentions or actions of the parties with whom we do business. While we are not aware of any such intentions or actions, we have only limited knowledge regarding the intentions or actions underlying those arrangements. Conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy one of these safe harbor provisions may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply more broadly to items or services covered by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The federal civil False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil federal civil False Claims Act.
In addition, private parties may initiate “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against any person or entity under the federal civil False Claims Act in the name of the government and share in the proceeds of the lawsuit. Penalties for federal civil False Claim Act violations include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, most critically, may provide the basis for exclusion from the federally funded healthcare program. On May 20, 2009, the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act of 2009 ("FERA") was enacted, which modifies and clarifies certain provisions of the federal civil False Claims Act. In part, the FERA amends the federal civil False Claims Act such that penalties may now apply to any person, including an organization that does not contract directly with the government, who knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim paid in part by the federal government. The government may further prosecute conduct constituting a false claim under the federal criminal False Claims Act. The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent and, unlike the federal civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, the government may impose civil fines and penalties ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
The Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981 imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") also created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Many foreign countries have similar laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. Foreign laws and regulations may vary greatly from country to country. For example, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to E.U. Directives concerning misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Also, many U.S. states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased foreign, federal, and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on certain drug, biologics, medical supplies and device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members), certain other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,278 per failure up to an aggregate of $169,170 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.128 million per year for “knowing failures”). Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain foreign countries and U.S. states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect personal information including certain patient health information, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, in the U.S.
HIPAA established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requires certain entities, called covered entities, to comply with standards that include the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”). HIPAA also requires business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that have access to PHI in connection with providing a service to or on behalf of a covered entity, of covered entities to enter into business associate agreements with the covered entity and to safeguard the covered entity’s PHI against improper use and disclosure.
The HIPAA privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities as well as business associates, which are defined to include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a business associate. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. HITECH, among other things, established certain health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify any individual whose PHI is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI as defined under HIPAA.
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we would be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") which would post the violation on its website, and to the media. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $57,051 per violation, not to exceed $1.71 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment.
HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents for violations. Courts are able to award damages, costs and attorneys’ fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to file suit against us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care cases in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities, and their business associates for compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security standards. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty paid by the violator.
In the E.U., we are subject to laws which restrict our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations, including clinical trials. We process data of our employees, contractors, suppliers, distributors, service providers and our customers, as well as patient or clinical trial participants, including health and medical information of such participants. The data privacy regime in the E.U. includes the GDPR and the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and the national laws implementing or supplementing each of them. The GDPR permits E.U. Member State derogations for certain matters and, accordingly, we are also subject to E.U. national laws relating to the processing of certain data such as genetic data, biometric data and health data. Each E.U. Member State has transposed the requirements laid down by the E-Privacy Directive into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws (including jurisdictions in which we are targeting or monitoring E.U. located individuals). In addition, the E.U. is in the process of replacing the E-Privacy Directive with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation, and the E-Privacy Regulation will be directly implemented in the laws of each E.U. Member State, during 2020 or 2021 following a transition period. We are likely to be required to expend further capital and other resources to ensure compliance with these changing laws and regulations.
The GDPR came into force on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the “Directive”). Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at national level), the GDPR text is directly applicable in each E.U. Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the E.U. However, as noted above, the GDPR provides that E.U. Member States may introduce further conditions, including limitations which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data (including genetic, biometric or health data), or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. We are working with external advisers to undertake a robust program that we believe will ensure compliance with these obligations. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/ change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm. 
We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and EEA. Where we transfer personal data out of the E.U. or EEA to countries which are not considered by the European Commission to offer adequate protection of personal data, we need to ensure that such transfers are legitimized by valid transfer solutions and/or derogations under the GDPR, including by entering into the E.U. Commission approved model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) or by way of an alternative transfer solution permitted under E.U. law. We note that there is ongoing litigation in the E.U. challenging the legitimacy of the most commonly relied upon transfer solution by organizations: the standard contractual clauses. As such, it is uncertain whether the standard contractual clauses may be invalidated as a compliant data transfer mechanism in the near future. We have enlisted the help of external advisors to provide assistance in implementing a robust program that we believe will achieve and maintain compliance with these obligations which is likely to require us to expend capital and other resources. In addition, the exit of the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) from the E.U. will mean that at some point that the U.K. will become a “third party” for the purposes of data transfers under the GDPR.
We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business , a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each new provider we perform security assessments and detailed due diligence, enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. We have enlisted the help of external advisors to provide assistance in implementing these contractual arrangements with our existing providers. There is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information. Any violation of data or security laws by our third party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in the fines and penalties outlined above.
We are also subject to evolving E.U. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. The draft E-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e. the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual revenue). While the e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process and commentators now expect it to be adopted during the second half of 2020 or during 2021 following a transition period. We have enlisted the help of external advisors to provide assistance in implementing a robust program that we believe will ensure compliance with these obligations which is likely to require us to expend capital and other resources.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S., for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, a 2.3% federal excise tax, with limited exceptions, on any entity that manufactures or imports Class I, II and III medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. that began on January 1, 2013. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020. The Affordable Care Act also provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act has expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We do not yet know the full impact that the Affordable Care Act will have on our business. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. Moreover, the Trump Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the Affordable Care Act, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Most recently, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the individual mandate to carry health insurance, beginning in 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, ruled that the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate to carry insurance coverage is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act will impact the Act and our business. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief
 Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Laws
Our U.S. operations are subject to the FCPA. We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
Segment Information
We globally manage our business within one reporting segment. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews our business, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses our operating performance. 
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced seasonality in our first and fourth quarters, and we expect this trend to continue. We have experienced and may in the future experience higher sales in the fourth quarter as a result of patients having paid their annual insurance deductibles in full, thereby reducing their out-of-pocket costs. In the first quarter of each year in Europe, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, reduced demand for our Inspire therapy as Neue Untersuchungs-und-Behandlungsmethoden ("NUB") coverage status is being determined and as hospitals are establishing their budgets pertaining to allocation of funds to purchase our Inspire therapy.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 165 employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

We were incorporated in Delaware in November 2007 when our predecessor, Inspire Medical Systems, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, was spun-off from Medtronic. Inspire Medical Systems, LLC merged with us in November 2007, and we continued as the surviving entity.
