ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company
Urban Edge Properties (“UE”, “Urban Edge” or the “Company”) (NYSE: UE) is a Maryland REIT that manages, develops, redevelops, and acquires retail real estate, primarily in the New York metropolitan area. Urban Edge Properties LP (“UELP” or the “Operating Partnership”) is a Delaware limited partnership formed to serve as UE’s majority-owned partnership subsidiary and to own, through affiliates, all of our real estate and other assets. UE and UELP were created in 2014 to own the majority of Vornado Realty Trust’s (“Vornado”) (NYSE: VNO) former shopping center business (the “UE Business”), and separated from Vornado in January 2015. Our portfolio is currently comprised of 83 shopping centers, four malls and a warehouse park totaling approximately 16.3 million square feet (sf) with a consolidated occupancy rate of 93.1%. 
Unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to UE after giving effect to the transfer of the UE Business from Vornado, and for periods prior to such transfer, refer to the UE Business while owned by Vornado. 
The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), commencing with the filing of its 2015 tax return for its tax year ended December 31, 2015. With the exception of the Company’s taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), to the extent the Company meets certain requirements under the Code, the Company will not be taxed on its federal taxable income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any alternative minimum tax, which, for corporations, was repealed under the TCJA (defined below) for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. In addition to its TRS, the Company is subject to certain foreign and state and local income taxes, including a 29% non-resident withholding tax on its two Puerto Rico malls, which are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
Company Strategies
Our goal is to be a leading owner and operator of retail real estate in major urban markets, with a focus on the New York metropolitan area. We believe urban markets offer attractive acquisition and redevelopment opportunities resulting from high population density, strong demand from consumers for differentiated live-work-play environments with access to public transportation, above average retailer sales trends, a limited supply of institutional quality assets and a strong supply of older, undermanaged assets that remain privately owned. We seek to create value through the following primary strategies: 
Maximizing the value of existing properties through proactive management. We intend to maximize the value of each of our assets through comprehensive, proactive management encompassing: continuous asset evaluation for highest-and-best-use; efficient and cost-conscious day-to-day operations that minimize retailer operating expense and enhance property quality; and targeted leasing to desirable tenants. Leasing is a critical value-creation function that includes:

• | Monitoring retailer sales, merchandising, store operations, timeliness of payments, overall financial condition and related factors;


• | Being constantly aware of each asset’s competitive position and recommending physical improvements or adjusting merchandising if circumstances warrant;


• | Continuously canvassing trade areas to identify unique operators that can distinguish a property and enhance its offerings;


• | Maintaining regular contact with the brokerage community to stay abreast of new merchants, potential relocations, new supply and overall trade area dynamics;


• | Conducting regular portfolio reviews with key merchants;


• | Building and nurturing deep relationships with retailer decision-makers;


• | Focusing on spaces with below-market leases that might be recaptured;


• | Understanding the impact of options, exclusives, co-tenancy and other restrictive lease provisions; and


• | Optimizing required capital investment in every transaction.

Actively investing. We intend to acquire properties in our target markets that meet our criteria for risk-adjusted return and enhance the overall quality of our existing portfolio. 
Investment considerations include: 

• | Geography: We focus primarily on the New York metropolitan area and secondarily on the Washington, DC to Boston corridor. We intend to invest in our existing core markets, and, overtime, may expand into new markets that have similar characteristics.


• | Product: We generally seek large properties that provide scale relative to the competition and optionality for redevelopment to meet the changing demands of the local community.


• | Tenancy: We consider tenant mix, sales performance and related occupancy cost, lease term, lease provisions, omni-channel capabilities, susceptibility to e-commerce disruption and other factors. Our tenant base comprises a diverse group of merchants, including department stores, supermarkets, discounters, entertainment offerings, health clubs, DIY stores, in-line specialty shops, restaurants and other food and beverage vendors and service providers.


• | Rent: We consider existing rents relative to market rents and target submarkets that have potential for market rent growth as evidenced by strong retailer sales performance.


• | Competition and Barriers-to-Entry: We seek assets in underserved, high barrier-to-entry markets in densely populated, affluent trade areas. We believe that properties located in such markets present more attractive risk-return profile relative to other markets.


• | Access and Visibility: We seek assets with convenient access and good visibility.


• | Physical Condition: We consider aesthetics, functionality, building and site conditions and environmental matters in evaluating asset quality.

Constantly evaluating our portfolio and, where appropriate, engaging in selective dispositions. We regularly evaluate each property and intend to dispose of those properties that do not meet our investment criteria.
Maintaining capital discipline. We intend to keep our balance sheet flexible and capable of supporting growth. We expect to generate increasing levels of cash flow from internally generated funds and to have substantial borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit agreement and from potential secured debt financing on our existing assets.
Significant Tenants
None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Home Depot, Inc. is our largest tenant and accounted for approximately $22.6 million, or 5.5% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Employees
Our headquarters are located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, NY 10019. As of December 31, 2018, we had 116 employees.

Supplement to Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
This summary supplements and updates the discussion contained under the caption “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the prospectus dated August 5, 2016, contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2016 and any prospectus supplements thereto, should be read in conjunction therewith and is subject to the qualifications set forth therein. This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
The reference to the “PATH Act” in the second paragraph in the section titled “Investments in Partnerships” on page 44 of the prospectus is replaced with the “Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.”
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”), generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, made significant changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders, and, in certain cases, that modify the tax rules discussed in the accompanying prospectus. 
Among other changes, the TCJA made the following changes:

• | For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, (i) the U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income of individuals, trusts and estates have been generally reduced and (ii) non-corporate taxpayers are permitted to take a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received from REITs that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, subject to certain limitations.


• | The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for corporations has been reduced from 35% to 21%, and corporate alternative minimum tax has been eliminated for corporations, which would generally reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax payable by our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) and by us to the extent we were subject to corporate U.S. federal income tax (for example, if we distributed less than 100% of our taxable income or recognized built-in gains in assets acquired from C corporations). In addition, the maximum withholding rate on distributions by us to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is reduced from 35% to 21%. 


• | Certain new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense now apply which may affect the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by us or our TRSs.


• | Certain new limitations on net operating losses now apply which may affect net operating losses generated by us or our TRSs.


• | A U.S. tax-exempt stockholder that is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) will generally be required to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI.


• | New accounting rules generally require us to recognize income items for federal income tax purposes no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes, which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items.

This summary does not purport to be a detailed discussion of the changes to U.S. federal income tax laws as a result of the enactment of the TCJA. Technical corrections or other amendments to the TCJA or further administrative and regulatory guidance interpreting the TCJA may be forthcoming at any time. We cannot predict the long-term effect of the TCJA or any future law changes on REITs or their stockholders. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of the TCJA based on their particular circumstances. 
Consolidated Appropriations Act
The Consolidated Appropriations Act amended various provisions of the Code and implicates certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. The discussion contained in the second and third paragraphs under “Qualified Shareholders and Qualified Foreign Pension Funds” on page 55 of the prospectus is replaced with the following paragraph:
For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. stockholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership 
3

organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder’s stock (with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of USRPIs. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. 
The discussion contained in the fourth paragraph under “Qualified Shareholders and Qualified Foreign Pension Funds” on page 55 of the prospectus is replaced with the following paragraph:
For periods on or after December 18, 2015, for FIRPTA purposes neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor any entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a non-U.S. stockholder. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established by a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions thereof) or one or more employers to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees as a result of, or in consideration for, services rendered, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. 
Recent FATCA Proposed Treasury Regulations
On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. While these regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions) As a result, the discussion in under “Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Entities and Other Foreign Entities” on pages 56 and 69 of the prospectus replaced with the following paragraph: 
Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), a 30% withholding tax (“FATCA withholding”) may be imposed on certain payments to you or to certain foreign financial institutions, investment funds and other non-U.S. persons receiving payments on your behalf if you or such persons fail to comply with information reporting requirements. Such payments will include U.S.-source dividends and, subject to the proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below, the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of stock that can produce U.S.-source dividends. Payments of dividends that you receive in respect of shares could be affected by this withholding if you are subject to the FATCA information reporting requirements and fail to comply with them or if you hold Urban Edge Properties shares through a non-U.S. person (e.g., a foreign bank or broker) that fails to comply with these requirements (even if payments to you would not otherwise have been subject to FATCA withholding). While withholding under FATCA would have applied to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Urban Edge Properties shares on or after January 1, 2019, recently proposed Treasury Regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury Regulations are issued. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the relevant U.S. law and other official guidance on FATCA withholding.
