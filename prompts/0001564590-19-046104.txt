 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
 Mesa Airlines is a regional air carrier providing scheduled passenger service to 125 cities in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, Mexico and Cuba. All of our flights are operated as either American Eagle or United Express flights pursuant to the terms of capacity purchase agreements we entered into with American Airlines, Inc. ("American") and United Airlines, Inc. ("United") (each, our "major airline partner"). We have a significant presence in several of our major airline partners' key domestic hubs and focus cities, including Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Washington-Dulles.
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated a fleet of 145 aircraft with approximately 730 daily departures. We operate 62 CRJ-900 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with American (our "American Capacity Purchase Agreement") and 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft under our capacity purchase agreement with United (our "United Capacity Purchase Agreement"). For our fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, approximately 44% of our aircraft in scheduled service were operated for American and approximately 56% were operated for United. All of our operating revenue in our 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements. 
 Our capacity purchase agreements provide us guaranteed monthly revenue for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight actually flown, and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying on behalf of our major airline partners. Our capacity purchase agreements also shelter us, to an extent, from many of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including fuel prices, variations in ticket prices, and fluctuations in number of passengers. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, we use the logos, service marks, flight crew uniforms and aircraft paint schemes of our major airline partners. Our major airline partners control route selection, pricing, seat inventories, marketing and scheduling, and provide us with ground support services, airport landing slots and gate access. 
 Regional aircraft are optimal for short and medium-haul scheduled flights that connect outlying communities with larger cities and act as "feeders" for domestic and international hubs. In addition, regional aircraft are well suited to serve larger city pairs during off-peak times when load factors on larger jets are low. The lower trip costs and operating efficiencies of regional aircraft, along with the competitive nature of the capacity purchase agreement bidding process, provide significant value to major airlines. According to the Regional Airline Association, we were the 3rd largest regional airline in the United States in 2018, as measured by passenger enplanements, and our flights accounted for approximately 9.0% of
 all passengers carried on U.S. regional airlines. 
 Regional airlines play a daily, essential role in the U.S. air travel system. According to the Regional Airline Association, 41% of all scheduled passenger flights in the United States in 2018 were operated by regional airlines. Of all the U.S. airports with scheduled passenger service, 63% are served exclusively by regional airlines. Some of the most popular U.S. airports have more than half of their scheduled departures made by regional aircraft, including New York-LaGuardia, Philadelphia, Washington-Dulles, Charlotte, Houston-Bush and Chicago-O'Hare.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our business strategy consists of the following elements:
 Maintain Low-Cost Structure. We have established ourselves as a low cost, efficient and reliable provider of regional airline services. We intend to continue our disciplined cost control approach through responsible outsourcing of certain operating functions, by flying large regional aircraft with associated lower maintenance costs and common flight crews across fleet types, and through the diligent control of corporate and administrative costs implementing company-wide efforts to improve our cost position. Additionally, we expect our long-term collective bargaining agreements to protect us from significant labor cost increases over the next five years. These efficiencies, coupled with the low average seniority of our pilots, has enabled us to compete aggressively on price in our capacity purchase agreement negotiations.
 Attractive Work Opportunities. We believe our employees have been, and will continue to be, a key to our success. Our ability to attract, recruit and retain pilots has supported our industry-leading fleet growth. We intend to continue to offer competitive compensation packages, foster a positive and supportive work environment and provide opportunities to fly state-of-the-art, large-gauged regional jets to differentiate us from other carriers and make us an attractive place to work and build a career.
 4

Maintain a Prudent and Conservative Capital Structure. We intend to continue to maintain a prudent capital structure. We believe that the strength of our balance sheet and credit profile will enable us to optimize terms with lessors and vendors and, when preferred by our major airline partners, allow us to procure and finance aircraft on competitive terms. 
 
Minimize Tail Risk. We have structured our aircraft leases and financing arrangements to minimize or eliminate, as much as possible, so-called "tail risk," which is the amount of aircraft-related lease obligations or projected negative equity existing beyond the term of that aircraft's corresponding capacity purchase agreement. As of September 30, 2019, we had 17 aircraft with leases extending past the term of their corresponding capacity purchase agreements with an aggregate exposure of approximately $32.2 million and no financing arrangements with projected negative equity. We intend to continue to align the terms of our aircraft leases and financing agreements with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements in order to maintain low "tail risk."
 Aircraft Fleet
 We fly only large regional jets manufactured by Bombardier and Embraer S.A. ("Embraer"). Operating large regional aircraft allows us to enjoy operational, recruiting and cost advantages over other regional airlines that operate smaller regional aircraft.
 As of September 30, 2019, we had 145 aircraft (owned and leased) consisting of the following:
 
 
 | Embraer | | Canadair | Canadair | Canadair | | 
---------------+---------------+----+------------+---------------+---------------+----+------
 | Regional | | Regional | Regional | Regional | | 
 | Jet-175 | | Jet-700 | Jet-900 | Jet-200 | |

Unassigned | | — | | — | | 2 | | 1 | 3 
Total | | 60 | | 20 | | 64 | | 1 | 145


(1) | In April 2019, we converted two aircraft to operational spares and removed them from service under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | CRJ-200 is an operational spare not assigned for service under our capacity purchase agreements.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The following table lists the aircraft we own and lease as of September 30, 2019:
 
 
Type of Aircraft | Owned | | Leased | | Total | | Passenger Capacity
---------------------+-------+----+--------+----+-------+-----+-------------------
E-175 Regional Jet | | 18 | | 42 | | (1) | 60 | | 76

Total | | 85 | | 60 | | | 145 | | 


(1) | These aircraft are owned by United and leased to us at nominal amounts.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Bombardier and Embraer regional jets are among the quietest commercial jets currently available and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand-up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in-flight snack and beverage service. The speed of Bombardier and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively. We do not currently have any existing arrangements with Bombardier or Embraer to acquire additional aircraft.
 Capacity Purchase Agreements
 Our capacity purchase agreements consist of the following:
  
▪ | Operation of CRJ-900 aircraft under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Operation of CRJ-700 and E-175 aircraft under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5

The financial arrangement underlying our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements includes a revenue-guarantee arrangement. Under the revenue-guarantee provisions of our capacity purchase agreements, our major airline partners pay us a fixed minimum monthly amount per aircraft under contract, plus additional amounts related to departures and block hours flown. We also receive direct reimbursement of certain operating expenses, including insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and ground operations are directly paid to suppliers by our major airline partners. We believe we are in material compliance with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements and enjoy good relationships with our major airline partners.
 We benefit from our capacity purchase agreements and revenue guarantees because we are sheltered, to an extent, from some of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, fluctuations in number of passengers and fuel prices. However, we do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices (including ancillary revenue programs), the number of passengers enplaned or reductions in fuel prices. Our major airline partners retain all revenue collected from passengers carried on our flights. In providing regional flying under our capacity purchase agreements, we use the logos, service marks and aircraft paint schemes of our major airline partners.
 The following table summarizes our available seat miles ("ASMs") flown and contract revenue recognized under our capacity purchase agreements for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, 2019 | | Year Ended September 30, 2018 | 
---------+-------------------------------+------------+-------------------------------+--

American Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated 62 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. In exchange for providing flight services under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during each month. In addition, we may also receive incentives or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departures and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including passenger liability and hull insurance and aircraft property taxes, all as set forth in our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by American. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to us, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at American hubs and cities where we operate.
 Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement establishes minimum levels of flight operations. In prior periods, the FAA Qualification Standards (as defined below) have negatively impacted our ability to hire pilots at a rate sufficient to support required utilization levels, and, as a result, we have issued credits to American pursuant to the terms of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, we issued credits of approximately $0.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement.
 Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement will terminate with respect to different tranches of aircraft between 2021 and 2025, unless otherwise extended or amended. American has the option to unilaterally extend the term of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement up to three times for one year each (on the same terms) by providing us prior written notice. Our American Capacity Purchase Agreement is subject to termination prior to that date, subject to our right to cure, in various circumstances including:
  
▪ | If either American or we become insolvent, file for bankruptcy or fail to pay our debts as they become due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Failure by us or American to perform the covenants, conditions or provisions of our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, subject to 15 days' notice and cure rights;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If we are required by the FAA or the DOT to suspend operations and we have not resumed operations within three business days, except as a result of an emergency airworthiness directive from the FAA affecting all similarly equipped aircraft, American may terminate the agreement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6

 
▪ | If our controllable flight completion factor falls below certain levels for a specified period of time, subject to our right to cure; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Upon a change in our ownership or control without the written approval of American.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the event that American has the right to terminate our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, American may, in lieu of termination, withdraw up to an aggregate of 14 aircraft from service under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. Upon any such withdrawal, American's payments to us would be correspondingly reduced by the number of withdrawn aircraft.
 As of September 30, 2019, American held 7.1% of our outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis, which interest American received in exchange for an extension of our capacity purchase agreement during our bankruptcy proceeding. 
 On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the American Capacity Purchase Agreement, the terms of which provide for new and revised operational performance metrics, the Company's right to earn additional incentive compensation based on the achievement of such metrics, and the right of American to permanently withdraw up to six (6) aircraft in the event the Company fails to meet such new/revised performance metrics.  Under the terms of such amendment the Company agreed, effective April 2, 2019, to convert two (2) aircraft to be utilized by the Company as operational spares in the Company's sole discretion throughout its system. 
 In July 2019, American exercised its right to permanently withdraw two (2) aircraft from the American Capacity Purchase Agreement due to the Company's failure to meet certain performance metrics. The aircraft were removed on November 2, 2019. 
 United Capacity Purchase Agreement
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In exchange for providing the flight services under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown and the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. United also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including property tax per aircraft and passenger liability insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by United. We also receive a minimum profit margin based upon our operational performance. Under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, United owns 42 of the 60 E-175 aircraft and leases them to us at nominal amounts. United reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units ("APUs") and component maintenance for the 42 E-175 aircraft owned by United.
 Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement permits United, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, to terminate the agreement in its discretion, or remove aircraft from service, by giving us notice of 90 days or more. In February 2018, we mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In July 2018, we were able to fully staff flight operations and these aircraft were placed back into service. During the temporary removal, we agreed to pay the lease costs associated with the two E-175 aircraft, which totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2018. If United elects to terminate our United Capacity Purchase Agreement in its entirety or permanently remove select aircraft from service, we are permitted to return any of the affected E-175 aircraft leased from United at no cost to us. In addition, if United removes any of our 18 owned E-175 aircraft from service at its direction, United would remain obligated to assume the aircraft ownership and associated debt with respect to such aircraft through the end of the term of the agreement.
 On November 26, 2019, we amended and restated our United Capacity Purchase Agreement to, among other things, incorporate the terms of the 11 prior amendments to that Agreement and to extend the term thereof through the addition of twenty (20) new Embraer E175LL aircraft to the scope of such Agreement.  These new aircraft will be financed and owned by us and operated for a period of twelve (12) years from the in-service date.  Deliveries of the new E175LL aircraft are scheduled to begin in May 2020 and be completed by December 31, 2020.  Commencing five (5) years after the actual in-service date, United has the right to remove the E175LL aircraft from service by giving us notice of 90 days or more, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain wind-down expenses plus, if removed prior to the ten (10) year anniversary of the in-service date, certain accelerated margin payments.   
 7

In addition to adding the 20 new E175LL aircraft to the amended and restated United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we extended the term of our 42 E-175 aircraft leased from United for an additional five (5) years, which now expire between 2024 and 2028.  As part of the amended and restated United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we agreed to lease our twenty (20) CRJ-700 aircraft to another United Express service provider for a term of seven (7) years. We will continue to operate such aircraft until they are transitioned over the period between May 2020 and December 2020. United has a right to purchase the CRJ 700 aircraft at the then fair market value. In addition, we own 18 E-175 aircraft that expire in 2028. 
 Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement is subject to early termination under various circumstances noted above and including:
  
▪ | By United if certain operational performance factors fall below a specified percentage for a specified time, subject to notice under certain circumstances;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | By United if we fail to perform the material covenants, agreements, terms or conditions of our United Capacity Purchase Agreement or similar agreements with United, subject to thirty (30) days' notice and cure rights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | If either United or we become insolvent, file bankruptcy or fail to pay debts when due, the non-defaulting party may terminate the agreement; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | By United if we merge with, or if control of us is acquired by another air carrier or a corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling another air carrier.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintenance and Repairs
 Airlines are subject to extensive regulation. We have a FAA mandated and approved maintenance program. Aircraft maintenance and repair consists of routine and non-routine maintenance, and work performed is divided into three general categories: line maintenance, heavy maintenance and component service. We also outsource certain aircraft maintenance and other operating functions. We use competitive bidding among qualified vendors to procure these services. We have long-term maintenance contracts with AAR to provide fixed-rate parts procurement and component overhaul services for our aircraft fleet. Under these agreements, AAR provides maintenance and engineering services on any aircraft that we designate during the term of the agreement, along with access to a spare parts inventory pool in exchange for a fixed monthly fee. Our agreements with AAR expire in 2026, unless earlier terminated for cause. We have not experienced difficulty obtaining spare parts on a timely basis for our aircraft fleet. As of September 30, 2019, $52.8 million of parts inventory was consigned to us by AAR under long-term contracts that is not reflected on our balance sheet.
 Line maintenance consists of routine daily and weekly scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft. Line maintenance is performed at certain locations throughout our system and represents the majority of and most extensive maintenance we perform. Major airframe maintenance checks consist of a series of more complex tasks that can take from one to four weeks to accomplish and typically are required approximately every 28 months, on average across our fleet. Engine overhauls and engine performance restoration events are quite extensive and can take two months. We maintain an inventory of spare engines to provide for continued operations during engine maintenance events. We expect to begin the initial planned engine maintenance overhauls on our new engine fleet approximately four to six years after the date of manufacture and introduction into our fleet, with subsequent engine maintenance every four to six years thereafter. Due to our current fleet size, we believe outsourcing all of our heavy maintenance, engine restoration and major part repair, is more economical than performing this work using our internal maintenance team.
 Competition
 We consider our competition to be those U.S. regional airlines that currently hold or compete for capacity purchase agreements with major airlines. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline, including Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation; Endeavor Air, Inc. (owned by Delta) ("Endeavor"); Envoy Air, Inc. ("Envoy"), PSA Airlines, Inc. ("PSA") and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. ("Piedmont") (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.) ("Horizon"); SkyWest Inc., parent of SkyWest Airlines, Inc. and ExpressJet Airlines, Inc.; Republic Airways Holdings Inc.; and Trans States Airlines, Inc. 
 Major airlines typically offer capacity purchase arrangements to regional airlines on the basis of the following criteria: availability of labor resources; proposed contract economic terms; reliable and on-time flight operations; corporate financial resources including ability to procure and finance aircraft; customer service levels; and other factors.
 8

Certain of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Moreover, economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns is somewhat mitigated by our reliance on capacity purchase agreements with revenue-guarantee provisions, but the renewal and continued profitability of these partnerships with our major airline partners is not guaranteed.
 Seasonality
 Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, since the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by increased utilization of our aircraft in the summer months and are unfavorably affected by increased fleet maintenance and by inclement weather during the winter months.
Aircraft Fuel
 Our capacity purchase agreements provide that our major airline partners source, procure and directly pay third-party vendors for all fuel used in the performance of those agreements. Accordingly, we do not recognize fuel expenses or revenues for flying under our capacity purchase agreements and we face very limited exposure to fuel price fluctuations.
Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the airline industry and as required by the DOT, lessors and other financing parties and our major airline partners under the terms of our capacity purchase agreements. The policies principally provide liability coverage for public and passenger injury; damage to property; loss of or damage to flight equipment; fire; auto; directors' and officers' liability; advertiser and media liability; cyber risk liability; fiduciary; workers' compensation and employer's liability; and war risk (terrorism). Although we currently believe our insurance coverage is adequate, we cannot assure you that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not be forced to bear substantial losses from accidents.
Employees
 As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 3,576 employees, consisting of 1,375 pilots or pilot recruits, 1,330 flight attendants, 60 flight dispatchers, 517 mechanics and 294 employees in administrative roles. Our continued success is partly dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never been the subject of a labor strike or labor action that materially impacted our operations.
 FAA regulations require pilots to have an Airline Transport Pilot ("ATP") license with specific ratings for the aircraft to be flown, and to be medically certified as physically fit to fly. FAA and medical certifications are subject to periodic renewal requirements including recurrent training and recent flying experience. Mechanics, quality-control inspectors, and flight dispatchers must be certificated and qualified for specific aircraft. Flight attendants must have initial and periodic competency training and qualification. Training programs are subject to approval and monitoring by the FAA. Management personnel directly involved in the supervision of flight operations, training, maintenance, and aircraft inspection must also meet experience standards prescribed by FAA regulations. All safety-sensitive employees are subject to pre-employment, random, and post-accident drug testing.
 The airline industry has from time to time experienced a shortage of qualified personnel, particularly with respect to pilots and maintenance technicians. In addition, as is common with most of our competitors, we have faced considerable turnover of our employees. Regional airline pilots, flight attendants and maintenance technicians often leave to work for larger airlines, which generally offer higher salaries and better benefit programs than regional airlines are financially able to offer. Should the turnover of employees, particularly pilots, sharply increase, the result will be significantly higher training costs than otherwise would be necessary and we may need to request a reduced flight schedule with our major airline partners, which may result in operational performance penalties under our capacity purchase agreements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit, train and retain the qualified employees that we need to carry out our expansion plans or replace departing employees.
 9

As of September 30, 2019, approximately 75.6% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective-bargaining agreements, as set forth below. No other employees of ours or our subsidiaries are parties to any other collective bargaining agreement or union contracts.
 
 
Employee Groups | Number of Employees | | Representative | | Labor Agreement Expiration
------------------+---------------------+-------+----------------+----------------------------------+---------------------------
Pilots | | 1,375 | | Air Line Pilots Association | | 7/13/2021
Flight Attendants | | 1,330 | | Association of Flight Attendants | | 10/1/2021
Dispatchers | | 60 | | N/A | | 
Mechanics | | 517 | | N/A | | 
Administrative | | 294 | | N/A | | 

 The Railway Labor Act ("RLA") governs our relations with labor organizations. Under the RLA, the collective bargaining agreements generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, they must notify the other party in the manner agreed to by the parties. Under the RLA, after receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board ("NMB") to appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no set timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation process. It is not unusual for those processes to last for many months, and even for a few years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare at some time that an impasse exists, and if an impasse is declared, the NMB proffers binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration. If arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day "cooling off" period commences. During that period (or after), a Presidential Emergency Board ("PEB") may be established, which examines the parties' positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another "cooling off" period of 30 days. At the end of a "cooling off" period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may strike and the airline may resort to "self-help," including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent "self-help" by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties. The table above sets forth our employee groups and status of the collective bargaining agreements.
 Safety and Security
 We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety of our operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements.
 Our ongoing focus on safety relies on training our employees to proper standards and providing them with the tools and equipment they require so they can perform their job functions in a safe and efficient manner. Safety in the workplace targets several areas of our operation including: dispatch, flight operations and maintenance.
 The TSA and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports, and international passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from U.S. international flights are subject to customs, border, immigration and similar requirements of equivalent foreign governmental agencies. We are currently in compliance with all directives issued by such agencies. We maintain active, open lines of communication with the TSA at all of our locations to ensure proper standards for security of our personnel, equipment and facilities are exercised throughout the operation.
 10

Facilities
 In addition to aircraft, we have office and maintenance facilities to support 

our operations. Each of our facilities are summarized in the following table:


 
Type | Location | Ownership | Approximate Square Feet | 
-----------------------------+----------------------+-----------+-------------------------+-------
Corporate Headquarters | Phoenix, Arizona | Leased | | 33,770
Training Center | Phoenix, Arizona | Leased | | 23,783
Parts/Stores | Phoenix, Arizona | Leased | | 12,000
Hangar | Phoenix, Arizona | Leased | | 22,467
Office, Hangar and Warehouse | El Paso, Texas | Leased | | 31,292
Office, Hangar | Dallas, Texas | Leased | | 30,440
Hangar | Houston, Texas | Leased | | 74,524
Hangar | Louisville, Kentucky | Leased | | 26,762
Hangar | Dulles, Washington | Leased | | 28,451

 
Our corporate headquarters and training facilities in Phoenix, Arizona are subject to long-term leases expiring on November 30, 2025 and May 31, 2025, respectively.
 We believe our facilities are suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated needs.
 Foreign Ownership
 Under DOT regulations and federal law, we must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law and regulations currently require that at least 75% of our voting stock must be owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by persons or entities who are U.S. citizens, as defined in the Federal Aviation Act, that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors and other managing officers be U.S. citizens, and that we be under the actual control of U.S. citizens. In addition, at least 51% of our total outstanding stock must be owned and controlled by U.S. citizens and no more than 49% of our stock may be held, directly or indirectly, by persons or entities who are not U.S. citizens and are from countries that have entered into "open skies" air transport agreements with the U.S. which allow unrestricted access between the United States and the applicable foreign country and to points beyond the foreign country on flights serving the foreign country. We are currently in compliance with these ownership provisions. As of September 30, 2019, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 3,600,953 shares of our common stock, with an exercise price of $0.004 per share. The warrants are not exercisable in violation of the restrictions imposed by federal law requiring that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens. 
Government Regulation
 Aviation Regulation
 The DOT and FAA have regulatory authority over air transportation in the United States and all international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the appropriate authorities of the foreign countries involved. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity, exemptions and other economic authority required for airlines to provide domestic and foreign air transportation. International routes and international code-sharing arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. A U.S. airline's ability to operate flights to and from international destinations is subject to the air transport agreements between the United States and the foreign country and the carrier's ability to obtain the necessary authority from the DOT and the applicable foreign government.
 The U.S. government has negotiated "open skies" agreements with many countries, which allow broad access between the United States and the applicable foreign country. With certain other countries, however, the United States has a restricted air transportation agreement. Our international flights to Mexico are governed by a recently implemented liberalized bilateral air transport agreements which the DOT has determined has all of the attributes of an "open skies" agreement. Our flights to Canada, Cuba and the Bahamas are governed by bilateral air transport agreements between the United States and such countries. Changes in U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Cuban or Bahamian aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of the corresponding air transport agreement, or otherwise affect our operations to and from these countries. In particular, there is still a degree of uncertainty about the future of scheduled commercial flight operations between the United States and Cuba as a result of changes in diplomatic relations between the two governments, as well as travel and trade restrictions implemented by the U.S. government in 2017. We are largely sheltered from the economic impact changes to existing "open skies" agreements or volatility in U.S., Mexican, Canadian, Cuban or Bahamian aviation polices because our major airline partners control route selection and scheduling under our capacity purchase agreements.

The FAA is responsible for regulating and overseeing matters relating to the safety of air carrier flight operations, including the control of navigable air space, the qualification of flight personnel, flight training practices, compliance with FAA airline operating certificate requirements, aircraft certification and maintenance requirements and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each commercial airline to obtain and hold an FAA air carrier certificate. We currently hold an FAR-121 air carrier certificate.
 Airport Access
 Flights at three major domestic airports are regulated through allocations of landing and takeoff authority (i.e., "slots" and "operating authorizations") or similar regulatory mechanisms, which limit take-offs and landings at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In the United States, the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at two of the airports we serve, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C. and New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA). In addition, John Wayne Airport (SNA) in Orange County, California, has a locally imposed slot system. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorizations, which are obtained by our major airline partners.
Consumer Protection Regulation
 The DOT also has jurisdiction over certain economic issues affecting air transportation and consumer protection matters, including unfair or deceptive practices and unfair methods of competition, lengthy tarmac delays, air carriers, airline advertising, denied boarding compensation, ticket refunds, baggage liability, contracts of carriage, customer service commitments, customer complaints and transportation of passengers with disabilities. The DOT frequently adopts new consumer protection regulations, such as rules to protect passengers addressing lengthy tarmac delays, chronically delayed flights, capacity purchase disclosure and undisclosed display bias, and is reviewing new guidelines to address the transparency of airline non-ticket fees and refunding baggage fees for delayed checked baggage. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements, code-sharing agreements (where an airline places its designator code on a flight operated by another airline) and wet-leasing agreements (where one airline provides aircraft and crew to another airline) between carriers and regulates other economic matters such as slot transactions.
Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties.
Other Regulations
 Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the RLA. The privacy and security of passenger and employee data is regulated by various domestic and foreign laws and regulations.
 The U.S. government and foreign governments may consider and adopt new laws, regulations, interpretations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could directly or indirectly affect our results of operations. We cannot predict what laws, regulations, interpretations and policies might be considered in the future, nor can we judge what impact, if any, the implementation of any of these proposals or changes might have on our business.
 Legal Proceedings
 We are subject to commercial and employment litigation claims and to administrative and regulatory proceedings and reviews. We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such claims, proceedings and reviews will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. Additionally, from time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory oversight in the ordinary course of our business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Mesa Air Group, Inc.
 Opinion on the Financial Statements
 We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mesa Air Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
 Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 The Company's airline operations are conducted by its regional airline subsidiary, Mesa Airlines, Inc. ("Mesa Airlines"), providing services to major air carriers under capacity purchase agreements. Mesa Airlines operates as American Eagle under a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines, Inc. ("American") and as United Express under a capacity purchase agreement with United Airlines, Inc. ("United"). All of the Company's consolidated contract revenues for years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were derived from operations associated with these two capacity purchase agreements. 
 The financial arrangements between the Company and its major airline partners involve a revenue-guarantee arrangement (i.e. a "capacity purchase agreement") whereby the major airline pays a monthly guaranteed amount for each aircraft under contract, a fixed fee for each block hour and flight flown and reimbursement of certain direct operating expenses in exchange for providing regional flying. The major airline partners also pay certain expenses directly to suppliers, such as fuel, ground operations and certain landing fees. Under the terms of these capacity purchase agreements, the major airline controls route selection, pricing and seat inventories, thereby reducing the Company's exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic, fare levels, and fuel prices. 
 On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company's consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares.
 On August 14, 2018, the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares (the "Firm Shares") of common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $115.6 million. Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price.  On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares ("Option Shares") of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. 
 The sale of these shares raised gross proceeds of approximately $124,247,820. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Option Shares by the selling shareholders. 
 As part of the IPO, stock appreciation rights ("SARs") previously issued under the Mesa Air Group, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (the "SAR Plan"), which settled only in cash, were cancelled and exchanged for an aggregate of 1,266,034 shares of restricted common stock under the Company's 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan") (see note 13 "Share-Based Compensation"), of which 966,022 were fully vested upon issuance and are included in the number of shares of common stock outstanding after the IPO. Of the 966,022 fully vested shares, 314,198 shares were retained by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations, resulting in a net issuance of 651,824 shares. Additionally, 983,113 shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 shares of existing unvested restricted phantom stock units and 491,198 shares of restricted stock under the 2011 and 2017 Plans, respectively.

American Capacity Purchase Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2019, the Company operated 62 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under a capacity purchase agreement. Unless otherwise extended or amended, the capacity purchase agreement for the aircraft expires between 2021 and 2025. In exchange for providing flights and all other services under the agreement, the Company receives a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours (the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination) flown during the month. In addition, the Company may also receive incentives or pay penalties based upon the Company's operational performance, including controllable on-time departure and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses the Company for the actual amount incurred for certain items such as passenger liability and hull insurance, and aircraft property taxes. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and fuel. The Company also receives a monthly profit margin payment from American based on the number of aircraft operating. The capacity purchase agreement is subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company's right to cure under certain conditions. American had a 7.1% and 7.2% ownership interest in the Company, calculated on a fully-diluted basis as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The related party amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations pertain to American. 
 On January 31, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the American Capacity Purchase Agreement, the terms of which provide for new and revised operational performance metrics, the Company's right to earn additional incentive compensation based on the achievement of such metrics, and the right of American to permanently withdraw up to six (6) aircraft in the event the Company fails to meet such new/revised performance metrics.  Under the terms of such amendment the Company agreed, effective April 2, 2019, to convert two (2) aircraft to be utilized by the Company as operational spares in the Company's sole discretion throughout its system. 
 In July 2019, American exercised its right to permanently withdraw two (2) aircraft from the American Capacity Purchase Agreement due to the Company's failure to meet certain performance metrics. The aircraft were removed on November 2, 2019. 
 As of August 28, 2019, the Company had failed to meet certain performance metrics under the Term Sheet (the "August Failure"), which failure gave rise to American’s right to permanently withdraw two additional aircraft from the American CPA.  In a separate agreement, American agreed to forbear from exercising its right to permanently withdraw these two aircraft.  Under the terms of such forbearance, the Company and American agreed to reset the measurement period for certain performance metrics effective as of August 29, 2019.  The parties also agreed that if the Company is out of compliance with applicable performance metrics on or after September 30, 2019, American retains the right to exercise its withdrawal rights for the August Failure by delivering 60 day prior written notice to the Company.
 United Capacity Purchase Agreement 
 As of September 30, 2019, we operated 20 CRJ-700 and 60 E-175 aircraft for United under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In exchange for providing the flight services under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown and the results of passenger satisfaction surveys. United also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including property tax per aircraft and passenger liability insurance. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by United. We also receive a minimum profit margin based upon our operational performance. Under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement, United owns 42 of the 60 E-175 aircraft and leases them to us at nominal amounts. United reimburses us on a pass-through basis for all costs related to heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, auxiliary power units ("APUs") and component maintenance for the 42 E-175 aircraft owned by United.
 Our United Capacity Purchase Agreement permits United, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain costs tied to aircraft type, to terminate the agreement in its discretion, or remove aircraft from service, by giving us notice of 90 days or more. In February 2018, we mutually agreed with United to temporarily remove two aircraft from service under our United Capacity Purchase Agreement. In July 2018, we were able to fully staff flight operations and these aircraft were placed back into service. During the temporary removal, we agreed to pay the lease costs associated with the two E-175 aircraft, which totaled $1.9 million as of September 30, 2018. If United elects to terminate our United Capacity Purchase Agreement in its entirety or permanently remove select aircraft from service, we are permitted to return any of the affected E-175 aircraft leased from United at no cost to us. In addition, if United removes any of our 18 owned E-175 aircraft from service at its direction, United would remain obligated to assume the aircraft ownership and associated debt with respect to such aircraft through the end of the term of the agreement.
 70

On November 26, 2019, we amended and restated our United Capacity Purchase Agreement to, among other things, incorporate the terms of the 11 prior amendments to that Agreement and extend the term thereof through the addition of twenty (20) new Embraer E175LL aircraft to the scope of such Agreement.  These new aircraft will be financed and owned by Mesa and operated for a period of twelve (12) years from the in-service date.  Deliveries of the new E175LL aircraft are scheduled to begin in May 2020 and be completed by December 31, 2020.  Commencing five (5) years after the actual in-service date, United has the right to remove the E175LL aircraft from service by giving us notice of 90 days or more, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain wind-down expenses plus, if removed prior to the ten (10) year anniversary of the in-service date, certain accelerated margin payments.   
 In addition to adding the 20 new E175LL aircraft to the amended and restated United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we extended the term of our 42 E-175 aircraft leased from United for an additional five (5) years, which now expire between 2024 and 2028.  As part of the amended and restated United Capacity Purchase Agreement, we agreed to lease our twenty (20) CRJ-700 aircraft to another United Express service provider for a term of seven (7) years, with Mesa continuing to operate such aircraft until they are transitioned over the period between May 2020 and December 2020. In addition, we own 18 E-175 aircraft that expire in 2028. United has a right to purchase the CRJ 700 aircraft at the then fair market value.
 The capacity purchase agreement is also subject to early termination for cause under specified circumstances and subject to the Company's right to cure under certain circumstances. United is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to terminate the agreement early in its discretion by giving us notice of 90 days or more. 
  
2. | Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
---+-------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles as found in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") and Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 The Company is an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act") and may remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO, subject to specified conditions. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company has elected to "opt out" of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 Use of Estimates 
 The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Segment Reporting 
 Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing operating performance. In consideration of ASC 280, "Segment Reporting," we are not organized around specific services or geographic regions. We currently operate in one service line providing scheduled flying services in accordance with our capacity purchase agreements. 
 71

While we operate under two separate capacity purchase agreements, we do not manage our business based on any performance measure at the individual contract level. Additionally, our chief operating decision maker uses consolidated financial information to evaluate our performance, which is the same basis on which he communicates our results and performance to our Board of Directors. He bases all significant decisions regarding the allocation of our resources on a consolidated basis. Based on the information described above and in accordance with the applicable literature, management has concluded that we are organized and operated as one operating and reportable segment. 
 All of our operating revenue in our 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years was derived from operations associated with our American and United Capacity Purchase Agreements.  It is currently impractical to provide certain information on our revenue from our customers for each of our services and geographic information on our revenues and long lived assets.
 Cash and Cash Equivalents
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
 Marketable Securities
 The Company's investments in marketable securities are deemed by management to be available-for-sale and are reported at fair market value. The Company's holdings of marketable securities as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $0.0 million and $19.9, respectively.
Restricted Cash 
 Restricted cash primarily includes deposits in trust accounts to collateralize letters of credit and to fund workers' compensation claims, landing fees, and other business needs. Restricted cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
 The Company has an agreement with a financial institution for a $6.0 million letter of credit facility to issue letters of credit for landing fees, workers' compensation insurance, and other business needs. Pursuant to such agreement, $3.6 million and $3.8 million of outstanding letters of credit are required to be collateralized by amounts on deposit as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash. 
 Expendable Parts and Supplies 
 Expendable parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market, and are charged to expense as they are used. The Company provides an allowance for obsolescence for such parts and supplies over the useful life of its aircraft after considering the useful life of each aircraft fleet, the estimated cost of expendable parts expected to be on hand at the end of the useful life, and the estimated salvage value of the parts. This allowance was $2.4 million and $1.8 million as of September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Prepaid Expenses 
 Prepaid expenses consist primarily of the excess of aircraft lease payments over the straight-lined lease expense. The straight-lined lease expense is net of estimated rebates to be received from the lessor during the term of the agreements, contingent on the Company performing certain engine restorations. 
Property and Equipment 
 Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of manufacturer incentives, and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values, which are 20% for aircraft and rotable spare parts, using the straight-line method. 
 72

Estimated useful lives of the various classifications of property and equipment are as follows:
 
 
Property and Equipment | Estimated Useful Life 
-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings | 30 years 
Aircraft | 25 years from manufacture date 
Flight equipment | 7-20 years 
Equipment | 5-9 years 
Furniture and fixtures | 3-5 years 
Vehicles | 5 years 
Rotable spare parts | Life of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less
Leasehold improvements | Life of the aircraft or term of the lease, whichever is less

 Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if (i) the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. The Company recognized no impairment charges on property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.
 Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company accounts for assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting standards that define fair value and establish a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
 Accounting standards include disclosure requirements relating to the fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels: 
  
▪ | Level 1 – Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Level 2 – Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Level 3 – Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prepaid Maintenance Deposits 
 Prepaid maintenance deposits consist of payments made on a monthly basis to cover certain future maintenance events for leased flight equipment. The deposits are contractual obligations that are held in trust by the lessors. The deposits are only to be used to cover maintenance events, which include, among other things, C-checks, engine restoration events, engine life limited parts, landing gear repairs, and auxiliary power unit overhauls. The Company expenses the service as it is performed and receives reimbursement from the reserve trust account. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Debt Financing Costs 
 Debt financing costs consist of payments made to issue debt related to the purchase of aircraft, flight equipment, and certain flight equipment maintenance costs. The Company defers the costs and amortizes them over the term of the debt agreement. Debt financing costs related to a recognized debt liability are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Debt financing costs with no related recognized debt liability are presented as assets, with the current portion included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
 73

Unutilized Manufacturer Credits 
 Manufacturer credits received in connection with aircraft purchases that can be used for the future purchase of certain goods and services are recorded as a prepaid asset based on the value of the credits expected to be utilized, and the Company reduces the asset as the credits are utilized to fund such purchases. The current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the noncurrent portion is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Intangibles 
 Customer relationships are amortized using future discounted cash flows over the estimated life. In accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, an intangible asset with a finite life that is being amortized is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired. The Company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset and if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value. If an impairment loss has occurred, a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. 
Other Assets 
 Other long-term assets primarily consist of noncurrent deferred reimbursed costs, debt financing costs, and prepaid maintenance deposits. 
 Income Taxes 
 Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in future years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards. The Company periodically reviews these assets to determine the likelihood of realization. To the extent the Company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable, an estimate of the unrealized position is made and a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. 
Other Noncurrent Liabilities 
 Other noncurrent liabilities consist of the remaining fair value adjustment for unfavorable aircraft operating leases related to a previous bankruptcy and related accounting. This adjustment to fair value is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining initial lease terms for these aircraft. During each of the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded amortization of this unfavorable lease liability of $5.7 million, $6.6 million, and $6.8 million, respectively, as a reduction of lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company wrote off $0.75 million and $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the "GECAS Lease Facility"), which was accounted for as lease termination expense.
 Adoption of New Revenue Standard
 On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASU 2014-09" or "ASC 606") using the modified retrospective method. See Note 3: "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information. To conform to ASC 606, the Company modified its revenue recognition policy as described below.
 74

Revenue Recognition 
 The Company recognizes revenue when the service is provided under its capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the major airline partners generally pay a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft, plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown. The contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by the Company in performing flight services. These costs, known as "pass-through costs," may include passenger and hull insurance as well as aircraft property taxes. Additionally, for the E-175 aircraft owned by United, the capacity purchase agreement provides that United will reimburse the Company for heavy airframe and engine maintenance, landing gear, APUs and component maintenance. The Company also receives compensation under its capacity purchase agreements for heavy maintenance expenses at a fixed hourly rate or per aircraft rate for all aircraft in scheduled service other than the E-175 aircraft owned by United.  The contracts also include a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs, as well as a profit margin, incentives and penalties based on certain operational benchmarks.  The Company is eligible to receive incentive compensation upon the achievement of certain performance criteria defined in the capacity purchase agreements. At the end of each period during the term of an agreement, the Company calculates the incentives achieved during that period and recognizes revenue attributable to the agreement during the period accordingly, subject to the variable constraint guidance under ASC 606. All revenue recognized under these contracts is presented as the gross amount billed to the major airline partners. 
 Under the capacity purchase agreements, the Company has committed to perform various activities that can be generally classified into in-flight services and maintenance services. When evaluating these services, the Company determined that the nature of its promise is to provide a single integrated service, flight services, because its contracts require integration and assumption of risk associated with both services to effectively deliver and provide the flights as scheduled over the contract term.  Therefore, the in-flight services and maintenance services are inputs to that combined integrated flight service. Both the services occur over the term of the agreement and the performance of maintenance services significantly effects the utility of the in-flight services. The Company's individual flights flown under the capacity purchase agreements are deemed to be distinct and the flight service promised in the capacity purchase agreements represents a series of services that should be accounted for as a single performance obligation.  This single performance obligation is satisfied over time as the flights are completed. Therefore, revenue is recognized when each flight is completed.
 In allocating the transaction price, variable payments (i.e. billings based on flights and block hours flown, pass-through costs, etc.) that relate specifically to the Company's efforts in performing flight services are recognized in the period in which the individual flight is completed. The Company has concluded that allocating the variability directly to the individual flights results in an overall allocation meeting the objectives in ASC 606. This results in a pattern of revenue recognition that follows the variable amounts billed from the Company to their customers.
 A portion of the Company's compensation under its capacity purchase agreements with American and United is designed to reimburse the Company for certain aircraft ownership costs. The Company has concluded that a component of its revenue under these agreements is deemed to be lease revenue, as such agreements identify the "right of use" of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period-of-time. The lease revenue associated with the Company's capacity purchase agreements is accounted for as an operating lease and is reflected as contract revenue on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.
 The Company recognized $219.0 million, $217.0 million and $217.6 million of lease revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has not separately stated aircraft rental income and aircraft rental expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations because the use of the aircraft is not a separate activity of the total service provided.  
 The Company's capacity purchase agreements are renewable periodically and contain provisions pursuant to which the parties could terminate their respective agreements, subject to certain conditions as described in Note 1. The capacity purchase agreements also contain terms with respect to covered aircraft, services provided and compensation as described in Note 1.  The capacity purchase agreements are amended from time to time to change, add or delete terms of the agreements.
 The Company's revenues could be impacted by a number of factors, including amendment or termination of its capacity purchase agreements, contract modifications resulting from contract renegotiations, its ability to earn incentive payments contemplated under applicable agreements, and settlement of reimbursement disputes with the Company's major airline partners. In the event contracted rates are not finalized at a quarterly or annual financial statement date, the Company evaluates the enforceability of its contractual terms and when it has an enforceable right, it estimates the amount the Company expects to be entitled to that is subject to the ASC 606 constraint.  
 75

The Company's capacity purchase agreements contain an option that allows its major airline partners to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that it operates for them. Both of the Company's major airline partners have exercised this option. Accordingly, the Company does not record an expense or revenue for fuel and related fueling costs for flying under its capacity purchase agreements.  In addition, the Company's major airline partners also provide, at no cost to the Company, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at their hubs and other cities. Services and facilities provided by the Company's major airline partners at no cost are presented net in its condensed consolidated financial statements; hence, no amounts are recorded for revenue or expense for these items.
 Contract Liabilities
 Contract liabilities consist of deferred credits for cost reimbursements from major airline partners related to aircraft modifications associated with capacity purchase agreements and pilot training.  The deferred credits are recognized over time depicting the pattern of transfer of control of services resulting in ratable recognition of revenue over the remaining term of the capacity purchase agreements.
 Current and non-current deferred credits are recorded to other accrued expenses and non-current deferred credits in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's total current and non-current deferred credit balances at September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 are $12.1 million, $15.4 million and $17.2 million respectively. The Company recognized $5.1 million, $4.4 million and $3.8 million of the deferred credits to revenue in the consolidated statements of operations during the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Contract Assets
 The Company recognizes assets from the costs incurred to fulfill a contract including aircraft painting and reconfiguration and flight service personnel training costs. These costs are amortized based on the pattern of transfer of the services in relation to flight hours over the term of the contract. Contract assets are recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's contract assets balances at September 30, 2019, September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 are $3.9 million, $4.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Contract cost amortization was $2.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
Maintenance Expense 
 The Company operates under an FAA approved continuous inspection and maintenance program. The Company uses the direct expense method of accounting for its maintenance of regional jet engine overhauls, airframe, landing gear, and normal recurring maintenance wherein the expense is recognized when the maintenance work is completed, or over the period of repair, if materially different. Our maintenance policy is determined by fleet when major maintenance is incurred. For leased aircraft, the Company is subject to lease return provisions that require a minimum portion of the "life" of an overhaul be remaining on the engine at the lease return date. The Company estimates the cost of maintenance lease return obligations and accrues such costs over the remaining lease term when the expense is probable and can be reasonably estimated. 
 Under the Company's aircraft operating lease agreements and FAA operating regulations, it is obligated to perform all required maintenance activities on its fleet, including component repairs, scheduled air frame checks and major engine restoration events. The Company estimates the timing of the next major maintenance event based on assumptions including estimated usage, FAA-mandated maintenance intervals and average removal times as recommended by the manufacturer. The timing and the cost of maintenance are based on estimates, which can be impacted by changes in utilization of its aircraft, changes in government regulations and suggested manufacturer maintenance intervals. Major maintenance events consist of overhauls to major components.
 Engine overhaul expense totaled $30.0 million, $51.2 million and $64.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $6.0 million, $12.3 million and $0.3 million was pass-through expense. Airframe check expense totaled $17.2 million, $21.5 million and $22.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $0.4 million, $7.5 million and $4.9 million was pass-through expense.
Pursuant to the United capacity purchase agreement, United reimburses the Company for heavy maintenance on certain E-175 aircraft. Those reimbursements are included in pass-through and other revenue. See Note 1: "Organization and Operations" for further information.
 76

Aircraft Leases
 In addition to the aircraft we receive from United under our Capacity Purchase Agreement, approximately 12% of our aircraft are leased from third parties. In order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease, we must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments. These estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease. All of our aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases, which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases. Additionally, operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and accordingly, neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. In the event that we or one of our major airline partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft, losses may be incurred. In the event that we exit an activity that results in exit losses, these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties, lease settle up and other charges. See Note 3: "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements below for a discussion of a new accounting standard that is likely to have an impact on our aircraft lease accounting beginning in fiscal year 2020.
Change in Accounting Policy 
 Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs") and Phantom Stock historically were accounted for as liability compensatory awards under ASC 710, Compensation – General, valued using the intrinsic value method, as permitted by ASC 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation, for nonpublic entities. Upon becoming a public company, as defined in ASC 718, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company was required to change its methodology for valuing the SARs and Phantom Stock. The SARs and Phantom Stock were re-measured at each quarterly reporting date and were accounted for prospectively at fair value using a Black-Scholes fair value pricing model until they were converted to restricted stock awards upon completion of the Company's IPO. The Company recorded the impact of the change in valuation methods as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, as permitted by ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The effect of the change increased the SARs and Phantom Stock liability by $2.4 million which was the difference in compensation cost measured using the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. An equal and offsetting change to retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet was recorded with the revaluation. Any future changes in fair value were recorded as compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Upon completion of the Company's IPO the SARs and Phantom Stock were cancelled and exchanged for shares of restricted stock under our 2018 Plan.

3. | Recent Accounting Pronouncements
---+---------------------------------

 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASC 606 establishes a new recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted this ASU using the modified retrospective method.  Under the new standard, the Company concluded that, in addition to the aircraft lease, the individual flights are distinct services and the flight services promised in the capacity purchase agreements represent a series of services that should be accounted for as a single performance obligation.  Revenue is recognized over time as the flights are completed.  The adoption of this ASU did not have an impact on recorded amounts when applied to the opening balance sheet as of October 1, 2018.  The adoption did not impact the condensed consolidated financial statements presented other than the disclosures noted in Note 2: "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."
 In August 2014, The FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements—Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205), which provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the consolidated financial statements. The new standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosure if "conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern." The update applies to all entities and is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter. The Company adopted this ASU in fiscal year 2018, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 77

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"), which provides guidance requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for substantially all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. 
 Based on the Company's initial assessment, the adoption of Topic 842 will significantly increase the Company's assets and liabilities primarily to reflect its aircraft operating lease liability and related right-of-use asset. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had 18 leased aircraft under operating leases in its fleet. The Company also has leases for a nominal fee for 42 aircraft owned by United, spare engines and other real estate leases. The Company does not expect the adoption of the New Lease Standard to impact any of its existing debt covenants. Additionally, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the recognition, measurement or presentation of lease revenue and lease expenses within the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of Topic 842 will have a material impact on the timing or amount of the Company's lease revenue as a lessor. The Company will adopt Topic 842 on October 1, 2019.
 The Company expects to elect several of the practical expedients available under the transition provisions of Topic 842, including (i) not reassessing whether expired or existing contracts contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) not revaluing initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company plans to elect the practical expedient which will allow aggregation of non-lease components with the related lease components when evaluating accounting treatment. Also, the Company plans to not apply Topic 842 to leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. Lastly, the Company currently plans to apply the modified retrospective adoption method, utilizing the simplified transition option available in Topic 842, which allows entities to continue to apply the legacy guidance in ASC 840, including its disclosure requirements, in the comparative periods presented in the year of adoption.
 Upon adoption, the Company anticipates it will reflect a lease liability in the range of $130 to $170 million and a right-of-use asset of $120 to $180 million. Upon adoption, the right-of-use asset is expected to include prepaid aircraft rents, accrued aircraft rents and deferred rent credits that were separately stated in the Company's September 30, 2019 balance sheet. These estimates are subject to revision based upon the Company's adoption of Topic 842 in fiscal year 2020.
 In March of 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"). With this standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are required to be recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of the year ended September 30, 2018. This change in accounting principle has been applied on a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of fiscal year 2018 as a cumulative-effect adjustment increasing deferred tax assets by $0.4 million, increasing income tax expense by $0.3 million, and increasing retained earnings by $0.7 million. Adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have any other material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018; the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.  
 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force), that requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 and modified the presentation to include changes in restricted cash in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

4. | Concentrations
---+---------------

 At September 30, 2019, the Company had capacity purchase agreements with American and United. All of the Company's consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and accounts receivable at the end of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was derived from these agreements. The terms of both the American and United capacity purchase agreements are not aligned with the lease obligations on the aircraft performing services under such agreements. As of September 30, 2019, we had 17 aircraft with leases extending past the term of their corresponding capacity purchase agreements which results in a significant amount of an aggregate exposure and no financing arrangements with projected negativity. We intend to continue to align the terms of our aircraft leases and financing agreements with the terms of our capacity purchase agreements in order to maintain low "tail risk."
 Amounts billed by the Company under capacity purchase agreements are subject to the Company's interpretation of the applicable capacity purchase agreement and are subject to audit by the Company's major airline partners. Periodically, the Company's major airline partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed. Ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon the Company prevailing under the applicable audit, but also upon the financial well-being of the major airline partner. As such, the Company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.0 million and $1.3 million at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the Company's ability to collect these receivables and the financial viability of our partners is materially different than estimated, the Company's estimate of the allowance could be materially impacted. 
 American accounted for approximately 53%, 54% and 56% of the Company's total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. United accounted for approximately 47%, 46% and 44% of the Company's total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A termination of either the American or the United capacity purchase agreement would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

 The Company recorded amortization of the unfavorable lease liability amounting to $5.7 million, $6.6 million and $6.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as a reduction to lease expense. During the year ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 the Company wrote off $0.8 million and $1.2 million of unfavorable lease liability related to the lease termination of its aircraft lease facility with Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, National Association, as owner trustee and lessor (the "GECAS Lease Facility"), which was accounted for as lease termination expense. 
  
7. | Fair Value Measurements
---+------------------------

 The Company did not measure any of its assets or liabilities at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2019 and 2018.
 The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable included on the consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2019 and 2018. 
 The Company's debt agreements are not traded on an active market. The Company has determined the estimated fair value of its debt to be Level 3, as certain inputs used to determine the fair value of these agreements are unobservable and, therefore, could be sensitive to changes in inputs. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of Level 3 debt. 
 80

The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including current maturities, were as follows (in millions): 
 
 
 | September 30, 2019 | | September 30, 2018 |

The net book value of collateralized aircraft and equipment as of September 30, 2019 was $1,203.5 million. 
 In December 2015, an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate ("EETC") pass-through trust was created to issue pass-through certificates to obtain financing for new E-175 aircraft. At September 30, 2019, Mesa has $191.2 million of equipment notes outstanding issued under the EETC financing included in long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. The structure of the EETC financing consists of a pass-through trust created by Mesa to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the pass-through trust and are not obligations of Mesa. 
 The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates were used to purchase equipment notes which were issued by Mesa and secured by its aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of Mesa. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates were initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until Mesa issued equipment notes to the trust, which purchased such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. 
 Mesa evaluated whether the pass-through trust formed for its EETC financing is a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE") and required to be consolidated. The pass-through trust was determined to be a VIE, however, the Company has determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass-through trust, and therefore, has not consolidated the pass-through trust with its financial statements. 
 On June 27, 2018, the Company refinanced $16.0 million of debt on six CRJ-900 aircraft (due in 2019), with $27.5 million of debt, resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company of $10.4 million after transaction related fees. The notes payable require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%. 
 On June 28, 2018, the Company purchased nine CRJ-900 aircraft, which were previously leased under the GECAS Lease Facility, for $76.5 million. The Company financed the aircraft purchase with $69.6 million in new debt and proceeds from the June 2018 refinancing of six CRJ-900 aircraft. The notes payable of $69.6 million require quarterly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2022 bearing interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 3.50% for the senior promissory notes to 7.50% for the subordinated promissory notes. The Company recorded non-cash lease termination expense of $15.1 million in connection with the lease buyout. Also, as part of the transaction, the Company (i) received $4.5 million of future goods and services credits and $5.6 million of loan forgiveness for loans with a maturity date in 2027 from the aircraft manufacturer, and (ii) mutually agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC to terminate the GE Warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock. 
 On January 28, 2019, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the "Term Loan") pursuant to which the lenders thereunder lent the Company term loans in the aggregate principal amount of $91.2 million.  Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.10%. This interest rate is significantly lower than the interest rate under the Company's Spare Engine Facility (defined above), which the Term Loan refinanced and replaced.  The Spare Engine Facility accrued interest at LIBOR plus 7.25%.  The Term Loan has a term of five years, with principal and interest payments due monthly over the term of the loan in accordance with an amortization schedule.  The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.6 million, due to a $1.9 million write-off of financing fees and $1.7 million in prepayment penalties, in connection with the repayment of the Spare Engine Facility. 
 83

On June 14, 2019, the Company completed the purchase of ten CRJ-700 aircraft, which were previously leased under the GECAS Lease Facility, for $70.0 million. The Company financed the aircraft purchase with $70.0 million in new debt. The notes payable of $70.0 million require monthly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2023 bearing interest at LIBOR plus 5.25%. The Company recorded non-cash lease termination expense of $9.5 million in connection with the lease buyout.
 On September 25, 2019, the company extended the term on their $35 million working capital draw loan by three years, which now terminates in September 2022. Interest is assessed on drawn amounts at one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%.
 On September 27, 2019, the company financed certain flight equipment for $8.0 million in new debt. The debt of $8.0 million require monthly payments of principal and interest through fiscal 2023 bearing interest at Libor plus 5.25%. 
  
9. | Earnings Per Share
---+-------------------

 Calculations of net income per common share were as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+-------
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | | 2017
Net income | $ | 47,580 | | $ | 33,255 | | $ | 32,828
Basic weighted average common shares outstanding | | 34,764 | | | 24,826 | | | 23,201
Add: Incremental shares for: | | | | | | | | 
Dilutive effect of warrants | | — | | | 116 | | | 93 
Dilutive effect of restricted stock | | 300 | | | 315 | | | 76 
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding | | 35,064 | | | 25,257 | | | 23,370
Net income per common share | | | | | | | | 
Basic | $ | 1.37 | | $ | 1.34 | | $ | 1.41 
Diluted | $ | 1.36 | | $ | 1.32 | | $ | 1.40 

 
Basic income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Mesa Air Group by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
 The number of incremental shares from the assumed issuance of shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants (excluding warrants with a nominal conversion price) is calculated by applying the treasury stock method. Share-based awards and warrants whose impact is considered to be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method were excluded from the diluted net income or loss per share calculation. In loss periods, these incremental shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share, as the inclusion of unvested restricted stock and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect. There were no anti-dilutive shares relating to restricted stock and exercise of warrants that were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017.
  
10. | Restatement
----+------------

Basic and Diluted Net Income per Common Share Available to Common Shareholders:
 Subsequent to the issuance of the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2018, we determined our previously issued consolidated financial statements included warrants with a nominal conversion price in diluted income per common share available to common shareholders, however, they should have been included in basic income per common share available to common shareholders.  As a result, basic income per common share available to common shareholders for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 have been restated to appropriately include the warrants with a nominal conversion price in basic income per common share available to common shareholders. Since diluted shares are under the treasury stock method, diluted common share available to common shareholders were impacted by this change and have been restated.  
 84

The restatement adjustment did not impact our previously reported consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, consolidated statements of cash flows, or net income (in thousands, except per share data).

11. | Common Stock
----+-------------

 The Company previously issued warrants to third parties, which had a five-year term to be converted to common stock at an exercise price of $0.004 per share.  Certain persons who are not U.S. citizens currently hold outstanding warrants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock. The warrants are exercisable if consistent with federal law, which requires that no more than 24.9% of the Company's stock be voted, directly or indirectly, or controlled by persons who are not U.S. citizens. The warrants can be converted to common stock upon warrant holders demonstrating U.S. citizenship or if consistent with above described federal law ownership limitations. In June 2018, the Company and holders agreed to extend the term of outstanding warrants set to expire by five years (through fiscal year 2023). 
 On June 28, 2018, the Company agreed with GE Capital Aviation Services LLC ("GE Capital") to terminate a warrant to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock held by GE Capital.  
 In July 2018, the Company's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following completion of the Company's IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances.   
 On August 8, 2018, the Company filed its Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, which, among other things: (i) effected a 2.5-for-1 stock split of its common stock; and (ii) increased the authorized number of shares of its common and preferred stock to 125,000,000 and 5,000,000, respectively. All references to share and per share amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively revised to reflect the stock split and increase in authorized shares.
 85

On August 14, 2018, the Company completed its IPO, in which it issued and sold 9,630,000 shares of common stock, no par value, at a public offering price of $12.00 per share (the "Firm Shares"). Additionally, in connection with the IPO, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional 1,444,500 shares of common stock at the same price.  On September 11, 2018, the Company closed the sale of 1,344,500 shares ("Option Shares") of its common stock, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option granted to the underwriters in its IPO. Of the 1,344,500 Option Shares sold, 723,985 were purchased directly from the Company and the remaining 620,515 shares were purchased directly from the selling shareholders. The Firm Shares and Option Shares were sold to the public for a price of $12.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds to us from the IPO were approximately $124.2 million. We received $111.7 million in net proceeds after deducting $8.7 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and $3.6 million in offering costs.
 On April 9, 2019, and pursuant to Section 4.4 of the 2018 Plan, the board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2018 Plan by 1,000,000 shares of common stock resulting in a total of 3,500,000 authorized shares.
 The Company has not historically paid dividends on shares of its common stock. Additionally, the Company's aircraft lease facility (the "RASPRO" Lease Facility) with RASPRO Trust 2005, a pass-through trust contains restrictions that limit the Company's ability to or prohibit it from paying dividends to holders of its common stock.

The Company has federal and state income tax NOL carryforwards of $478.3 million and $228.3 million, which expire in fiscal years 2027-2037 and 2020-2039, respectively.
 The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has provided a valuation allowance of $1.9 million in fiscal year 2019 and $1.9 million in fiscal year 2018 on the deferred tax assets related to these state NOL carryforwards. If or when recognized, the tax benefits related to any reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.
 The federal and state NOL carryforwards in the income tax returns filed included unrecognized tax benefits. The deferred tax assets recognized for those NOLs are presented net of these unrecognized tax benefits.
 Because of the change of ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, use of a portion of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in future periods. Further, a portion of the carryforwards may expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities.  The initial public offering in August of 2018 resulted in a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Based on the valuation of the Company's stock as of the initial public offering date, the Company does not believe any limitation on the utilization of the Company's current net operating losses would be applicable as of September 30, 2019.
 
The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
 
 
 | Years Ended September 30, | 
------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+------
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | | 2017
 | (in thousands) | 
Unrecognized tax benefits — October 1 | $ | 4,688 | | $ | 7,547 | | $ | 7,547
Gross decreases — tax positions in prior period | | — | | | (2,859 | ) | | — 
Unrecognized tax benefits — September 30 | $ | 4,688 | | $ | 4,688 | | $ | 7,547

 
The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 million, $4.7 million and $7.5 million as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, is included the net deferred tax assets. If recognized, the balance of the uncertain tax benefit would affect the effective tax rate. 
 We recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. We have not recorded accrued penalties or interest related to the unrecognized tax benefits noted above as the amounts would result in an adjustment to NOL carry forwards.
 87

We are subject to taxation in the United States and various states.  As of September 30, 2019, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal or state examinations by taxing authorities for fiscal years prior to 1999.
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act") made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, including but not limited to (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate, (2) changing rules related to uses and limitations of NOL carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT") and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, and (4) altering bonus depreciation rules that will allow for full expensing of qualified property. The Tax Act reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% in the Company's fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for the period beginning after December 31, 2017. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, and onward, the applicable federal corporate tax rate is 21%.
 The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provided a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company was required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 was complete. To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act was incomplete, but it was able to determine a reasonable estimate, it was required to record a provisional estimate in the financial statements. If a company was not able to determine a provisional estimate to be included in the financial statements, it continued to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately before the enactment of the Tax Act.  The one year measurement period ended during the Company's first quarter ended December 31, 2018.  As a result, the Company finalized provisional amounts originally recorded in connection with the Tax Act in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.
 In connection with the Company's initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, it recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $22.4 million in the period ended September 30, 2018. The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act.
 The Company's accounting for the Tax Act was completed as follows:
 Reduction of U.S. federal corporate tax rate: The Act reduced the corporate tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In the fourth quarter of the period ended September 30, 2018, the Company completed its analysis to determine the effect of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and recorded an adjustment of $0.9 million from the amount recorded in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year.  Consequently, the effect for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was a decrease related to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities of $22.0 million, excluding the valuation allowance.  The Company also calculated an increase to its valuation allowance of $0.5 million due to the rate change.  The Company recorded a corresponding net adjustment to its deferred income tax benefit of $21.5 million for the period ended September 30, 2018 as part of its completion of the accounting for Tax Act.
 For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the corporate AMT was repealed.  AMT credits in excess of regular tax liability are refundable in the years 2018 through 2021.  At September 30, 2018, the Company had $2.5 million of AMT credits, all of which is expected to be refunded.  The Company has classified a portion of the refund as a current receivable and a portion has been recorded as long-term receivable as of September 30, 2019.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the IRS released an announcement regarding Section 53(e) which no longer subjects taxpayers to a sequestration of its AMT credit refund.  As a result, the Company reversed a tax expense of approximately $0.1 million related to an estimated sequestration accrual previously recorded during the tax year ended September 30, 2018, resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.1 million for the tax year ended September 30, 2019.
 Valuation allowances: The Company determined whether the federal and state valuation allowance assessments were affected by various aspects of the Tax Act. Any corresponding determinations relating to changes in valuation allowances have, likewise, been completed with no changes identified with respect to the provisional amounts recorded.

13. | Share-Based Compensation
----+-------------------------

Restricted Stock 
 In July 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors and Compensation Committee approved the issuance of shares of restricted common stock under its 2018 Plan immediately following the IPO to certain of its employees and directors in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances. There were 966,022 vested SARs which were cancelled, exchanged for shares of restricted common stock and issued as restricted stock upon completion of the IPO. Immediately following the IPO, 2,249,147 shares were issued to certain of its employees and directors under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of 491,915 unvested restricted phantom stock units, 491,198 unvested restricted shares issued under the 2011 and 2017 Plans and 1,266,034 SARs (966,022 vested and 300,012 unvested).  The Company has the right to withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations and the withheld shares become available for future grants. The shares are valued at grant date based upon recent share transactions. From inception of the 2011 Plan through IPO, 2,448,905 shares have been granted, 1,978,550 shares have vested and 470,355 shares have been cancelled.  From inception of the 2017 Plan, 31,255 shares have been granted, 10,412 have vested and 20,843 shares have been cancelled. In April 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to management under the 2018 Plan from 2,500,000 to 3,500,000. From inception of the 2018 Plan, 2,571,073 shares have been awarded, 1,700,104 shares have vested and 22,995 shares have been cancelled.
 The restricted stock activity for our years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 is summarized as follows:

The Company has granted restricted stock awards ("RSAs") and restricted stock units ("RSUs") as part of its long-term incentive compensation to employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors.  RSAs and RSUs generally vest over a period of 3 to 5 years for employees and over one year for members of the Board of Directors.  The restricted common stock underlying RSAs are deemed issued and outstanding upon grant, and carry the same voting rights of unrestricted outstanding common stock.  The restricted common stock underlying RSUs are not deemed issued or outstanding upon grant, and do not carry any voting rights.
Stock Appreciation Rights 
 In 2014, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which certain executives and directors are eligible to receive grants of SARs (the "SARs Plan"). The SARs provide a participant with the right to receive the aggregate appreciation in stock price over the market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant, payable in cash. The participant may exercise his or her SARs quarterly after the grant is vested but no later than 10 years after the date of grant. The SARs awards vest ratably over a three year period from the date of grant. The Company had authorized 5,000,000 shares under this plan and had granted 4,204,993 since inception of the plan.

Phantom Stock 
 On October 17, 2017, the Company implemented a share-based payment plan under which employees, officers, directors and other individuals providing services to the Company are eligible to receive grants of restricted phantom stock units ("Phantom Stock Plan"). The restricted phantom stock units ("restricted stock units" or "RSUs") provide a participant with the right to receive a cash or stock bonus based on the fair market value of a stated number of RSUs that are vested. The shares of Common Stock that may be subject to RSUs granted under the Plan shall not exceed an aggregate of 1,250,000 shares. All of the RSUs are non-vested and forfeitable as of the grant date and vest over a three-year period. Any vested RSU will be settled by the Company upon vesting but no later than March 15 of the calendar year after the date that the RSUs become vested. The Company had authorized 1,250,000 shares under this plan and had granted 536,538 since inception of the plan. Since inception of the plan, 44,623 RSUs have vested or settled. In August 2018, upon completion of our IPO, 491,915 unvested RSUs were cancelled in exchange for shares of restricted stock under the 2018 Plan.   
 The phantom stock activity for the years ended September 30, 2018 were summarized as follows:

Following the IPO there will be no further grants under the Stock Appreciation Rights and Phantom Stock plans. Immediately following the IPO, shares of restricted common stock were issued to certain of its employees and directors under its 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of existing restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs. The shares of restricted common stock issued under the 2018 Plan in exchange for the cancellation of restricted phantom stock units, unvested restricted shares and SARs are subject to vesting on the same terms set forth in the prior vesting schedules and are not subject to acceleration in connection with the 2018 Plan issuances.
 As of September 30, 2019, there was $5.9 million, of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. 
 Compensation cost for share-based awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $5.5 million, $12.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.
 The Company repurchased 205,235 shares of its common stock for $1.9 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards and warrant conversions during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 438,541 shares of its common stock for $5.0 million to cover the income tax obligation on vested employee equity awards.

 At September 30, 2019, the Company leased 18 aircraft under non-cancelable operating leases with remaining terms of up to 4.5 years. The Company has the option to terminate certain leases at various times throughout the lease. The Company headquarters and other facility non-cancelable operating leases have remaining terms of up to 6.2 years. The leases require the Company to pay all taxes, maintenance, insurance, and other operating expenses. Rental expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, net of lessor rebates and other incentives. Aggregate rental expense under all operating aircraft, equipment and facility leases totaled approximately $72.8 million, $85.9 million and $83.8 million for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 Future minimum lease payments as of September 30, 2019, under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows (in thousands):

The majority of the Company's leased aircraft are leased through trusts that have a sole purpose to purchase, finance, and lease these aircraft to the Company; therefore, they meet the criteria of a variable interest entity. However, since these are single-owner trusts in which the Company does not participate, the Company is not at risk for losses and is not considered the primary beneficiary. Management believes that the Company's maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments.
  
16. | Contingencies
----+--------------

 The Company is involved in various legal proceedings (including, but not limited to, insured claims) and FAA civil action proceedings that the Company does not believe will have a material adverse effect upon its business, financial condition, or results of operations, although no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. 
  
17. | Selected Consolidated Quarterly Financial Data (unaudited)
----+-----------------------------------------------------------

 The following table sets forth certain unaudited selected consolidated financial information for each of the four quarters in the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017. In management's opinion, this unaudited consolidated quarterly selected information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all necessary adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for a fair presentation when read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes. We believe these comparisons of consolidated quarterly selected financial data are not necessarily indicative of future performance.
 Quarterly EPS may not total to the fiscal year EPS due to the weighted average number of shares outstanding at the end of each period reported and rounding.

Restatement
 Subsequent to the issuance of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2018, we determined our previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements included warrants with a nominal conversion price in diluted income per common share available to common shareholders, however, they should have been included in basic income per common share available to common shareholders.  Since diluted shares are under the treasury stock method, diluted income per common share available to common shareholders was impacted by this change.  As a result, basic and diluted income per common share available to common shareholders for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the quarter ended December 31, 2016 have been restated to appropriately include the warrants with a nominal conversion price in basic income per common share available to common shareholders.  
 The restatement adjustment did not impact our previously reported consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, consolidated statements of cash flows, or net income (in thousands, except per share data).

18. | Subsequent Events
----+------------------

 On November 26, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement with United, which amends and restates the United Capacity Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 29, 2013 (the "Original United CPA").  The Company entered into the Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement to, among other things, incorporate the terms of the 11 prior amendments to that Agreement, as well as agree upon the terms described below.
 The term of the Amended and Restated Capacity Purchase Agreement was extended through the addition of 20 new Embraer E175LL aircraft to the scope of such agreement, which aircraft will be financed and owned by the Company and operated for a period of 12 years from the in-service date.  The addition of these new aircraft increases the Company’s Embraer fleet to 80 aircraft.  Deliveries are scheduled to begin in May 2020 and be completed by December 31, 2020.  Commencing five (5) years after the actual in-service date, United has the right to remove the new E175LL aircraft from service by giving the Company 90 days or more notice, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of certain wind-down expenses plus, if removed prior to the ten (10) year anniversary of the in-service date, certain accelerated margin payments.  In addition to adding the 20 new E175LL aircraft, the Company also extended the term of the 42 E175 aircraft leased from United for an additional five (5) years.  
 In connection with the new Embraer E175LL aircraft deliveries, the Company has agreed to lease its twenty (20) CRJ700 aircraft to another United Express service provider for a term of seven years. The form of lease or sublease is to be mutually agreed upon between the parties, subject to receipt of any required third party consents.  The lessee must pay the Company a specified total per month for each aircraft plus specified supplemental rent payments for maintenance. The other United Express carrier will be responsible for all obligations under the leases. However, subject to certain limits and requirements. United will be responsible for certain unmet rent obligations under the leases.  In addition, United has a right to purchase the twenty (20) CRJ700 aircraft from Mesa at fair market value before or during the lease term.  
 On November 25, 2019, the Company amended its agreement with American Airlines. The Company did not meet certain performance metrics during the most recent measurement period, which allows American to remove two additional aircraft from the capacity purchase agreement. American has agreed to defer the right to remove these two aircraft but has elected to remove one of two previously deferred aircraft, effective January 2, 2020.  
 One December 11, 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with General Electric Company to purchase twenty (20) new spare CF34-8C5 engines. The Company expects to take delivery of the engines between August 2020 and December 2021.
