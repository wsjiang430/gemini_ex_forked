ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview and Strategy
Our goal is to discover and develop therapeutics to defeat degeneration. 
Neurodegeneration represents one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with few effective therapeutic options available for patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ("ALS"), and other neurodegenerative diseases. The burden of these diseases to patients and society is massive. 
We believe the time is right to make a strong and ambitious effort to defeat neurodegeneration. We believe that we can succeed in a field that has seen limited success in the past, because of our team of experienced and passionately dedicated scientists and drug developers, our focused scientific strategy, and our proprietary blood-brain barrier ("BBB") platform delivery technology. We are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development including two programs in patient studies for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and ALS and two programs starting IND-enabling studies for Hunter Syndrome and Parkinson’s disease.
Historical challenges in developing effective therapeutics for patients with neurodegenerative diseases included a scarcity of therapeutic targets due to a limited understanding of disease biology, insufficient uptake of therapeutics into the brain because of the BBB and few available biomarkers for target engagement, diagnosis, patient selection and tracking disease progression. In recent years, however, significant progress in each of these areas has been made, greatly increasing the likelihood of success of developing effective therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. 
Our scientific strategy is guided by three overarching principles. We believe that the application of these principles will significantly increase our probability of success and will accelerate the timing to bring effective therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative diseases: 
In building and developing our portfolio, we are guided by the principles outlined above, which means that (i) the therapeutic target or pathway for each program is genetically linked to neurodegenerative disease, (ii) our product candidates are being engineered to optimize brain delivery, and (iii) the clinical development plan is enabled by biomarkers. We rigorously follow the science and employ the therapeutic modality that we believe is best suited to modulate the target pathway. Our product candidates currently include small molecules, antibodies and enzymes and may expand to include other modalities in the future, including viral vectors.
To prioritize the allocation of our resources within our portfolio, we designate certain programs as core programs and others as seed programs. Our core programs are at various stages of clinical and preclinical development, and we believe that each of these programs has the potential to result in either first-in-class or best-in-class products for neurodegenerative diseases. 
To further increase the probability of success, we make parallel investments in lead and back-up development candidates, and plan to advance only those candidates to the later stages of clinical development that show strong preclinical and early clinical data. We replenish, grow and optimize our portfolio through in-house discovery and external business development activities, in each case enabled by our strong internal research and development expertise and capabilities. We maintain a high bar to move our product candidates through development and quickly terminate molecules and programs based on data that do not meet our rigorous discovery and development standards. 
By developing a broad portfolio of product candidates, we can apply learnings and tools across programs and leverage economies of scale in our research and development organization. Our target indications include diseases with large patient populations, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as orphan indications, such as mucopolysaccharidosis type II ("MPS II") or Hunter Syndrome, and ALS. We aim to increase the probability of success and accelerate clinical development timelines by using biomarkers and other tools to demonstrate an impact on relevant disease biology for proof of concept in early clinical trials. 
We have development and commercialization rights to all of our programs, including the programs partnered with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda"), as well as with Genzyme Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. ("Sanofi") for CNS indications, where we share responsibility for clinical development and share commercialization rights in the US and China. 
The following table summarizes key information about our programs: 

Delivering therapeutics across the BBB is critical to enabling effective treatments for CNS diseases, but this has been a major obstacle to successful drug development. Protein therapeutics, such as antibodies, have revolutionized the treatment of many diseases, but this class of medicines does not effectively cross the BBB and, therefore, currently has very limited therapeutic application to the treatment of CNS diseases. To address this limitation, we have developed proprietary drug delivery platform technologies, the most advanced of which is the TV platform. This technology enables the delivery of antibodies (Antibody Transport Vehicle or "ATV"), enzymes (Enzyme Transport Vehicle or “ETV") and other proteins (Protein Transport Vehicle or “PTV"). We have achieved proof of concept for the ATV and ETV platforms in mouse and nonhuman primate models. We are currently optimizing and broadening this platform technology.
Our ATV and ETV platforms are modular BBB delivery technologies for large molecule therapeutics, including antibodies, enzyme and other proteins.  
Therapeutic candidates enabled by the TV platform are designed to engage specific BBB transport receptors, which are ubiquitously expressed in the brain capillaries and facilitate transport of proteins into the brain. Data from both mouse and nonhuman primate animal models across multiple studies designed to demonstrate proof of concept of the ATV and ETV platforms have demonstrated a robust and sustained pharmacodynamic (“PD”) effect in the brain after intravenous dosing of ATV-enabled antibodies and ETV-enabled recombinant enzymes, while standard antibodies and conventional recombinant enzymes had minimal PD effect. Antibodies engineered with our ATV technology have demonstrated an increase in brain exposure of approximately 20-fold, compared to control antibodies not enabled by this technology, which translates to a brain to plasma ratio of approximately 2%, compared to approximately 0.1% brain concentrations commonly observed for control antibodies not enabled by this technology. The improvement in brain exposure may enable therapeutically relevant concentrations of our ATV and ETV product candidates in the brain, making them potentially superior to traditional monoclonal antibodies, enzyme replacement therapies and other large molecule therapeutics. 
We are currently developing several product candidates for multiple programs to advance into investigational new drug ("IND") enabling studies in preparation for human clinical trials. We plan to have multiple product candidates that utilize our TV platforms enter clinical development in 2019 and 2020, including molecules targeting alpha-synuclein ("aSyn"), iduronate 2-sulfatase ("IDS"), and triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 ("TREM2"); and Tau. In January 2018, we entered into an Option and Collaboration Agreement ("Takeda Collaboration Agreement") with Takeda pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, three of our programs (ATV:TREM2 and ATV:BACE1/Tau and a third identified, but yet undisclosed discovery stage program) that are enabled by our TV blood-brain barrier delivery technology and intended for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In February 2019, we amended the agreement with Takeda to replace the ATV:BACE1/Tau program with the ATV:Tau program, targeting only Tau. Based on progress with two of the three partnered programs, the criteria for certain defined milestones were met in the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and certain milestone payments received. If Takeda exercises its option for a particular target, we and Takeda will share equally the clinical development costs and the commercial profits for each collaboration program on a world-wide basis.
For small molecules, we follow a rigorous approach to designing these molecules to cross the BBB. DNL201 and DNL151, our small molecule inhibitors of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ("LRRK2"), and DNL747, our small molecule inhibitor of receptor interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 ("RIPK1"), have been specifically designed to cross the BBB. 
LRRK2 is a protein that regulates the function of the lysosome, an important cellular organelle involved in the physiological degradation of proteins. Increased LRRK2 activity is associated with perturbed lysosomal function, leading to reduced protein degradation and resulting in protein accumulation and cell death. Lysosomal dysfunction is a central pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Further, LRRK2 is genetically validated as a degenogene (a gene that causes or is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease) as mutations in LRRK2 are one of the most commonly known genetic causes of Parkinson’s disease. Inhibiting LRRK2 with a brain-penetrant small molecule drug may improve lysosomal function and result in therapeutic benefit for patients with Parkinson’s disease. In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, our lead LRRK2 product candidate, DNL201, met all objectives including CSF exposure levels and LRRK2 inhibition, as well as evidence of pathway engagement, at doses that were well tolerated. In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for DNL201 in Parkinson’s disease, including patients that carry a LRRK2 mutation and those without a LRRK2 mutation, i.e. sporadic Parkinson’s disease. In addition, we are conducting an ongoing Phase 1 healthy volunteer study with our back-up LRRK2 product candidate, DNL151. We intend to select one drug candidate for pivotal studies. 
RIPK1 is a protein that regulates the function of microglia, which are the resident immune cells in the brain and genetically implicated in the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Increased RIPK1 kinase activity drives neuroinflammation and necroptotic cell death. Inhibition of RIPK1 has been shown to have beneficial effects in preclinical models of Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and other diseases, including many systemic inflammatory diseases. In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, our lead RIPK1 product candidate, DNL747, met all endpoints, including CSF exposure levels, RIPK1 inhibition, and pathway engagement, at doses that were well tolerated. In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for DNL747 in ALS and in February 2019 we initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for DNL747 in Alzheimer’s disease. We have additional RIPK1 back-up candidates, including one that has completed IND-enabling studies. In October 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Sanofi ("Sanofi Collaboration Agreement"). Denali and Sanofi plan to jointly develop and commercialize products containing RIPK1 inhibitors for neurological indications, such as Alzheimer's disease, ALS, and MS, and Sanofi plans to develop and commercialize products containing RIPK1 inhibitors for systemic inflammatory indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
Collaborations and partnering are central components of our strategy to build and develop our portfolio of product candidates. We have arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies, technology companies, academic institutions, foundations, and patient-focused data companies. Notable active arrangements we have include those with Takeda, Sanofi, Genentech, F-star, Sirion, Harvard University, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and Centogene, amongst others. Through these arrangements, we are able to gain access to new product candidates, deepen our scientific understanding of certain areas of biology, identify potential patients for our clinical trials and thereby accelerate and increase the probability of success of the development of our programs. We believe that being an active participant in the scientific community and accessing external innovation is important to our success and we plan to remain active in business development activities. Our goal is to be the most attractive partner for academic groups and companies in the field of neurodegeneration based on our singular focus, deep scientific expertise in neurodegeneration and BBB biology, established research and development capabilities and ability to execute development programs with speed and scientific rigor.
Our Approach to Defeating Neurodegeneration
Disease Overview
Neurodegenerative diseases are a collection of conditions defined by progressive nervous system dysfunction, degeneration and/or death of neurons causing cognitive decline, functional impairment and eventually death. Neurodegeneration represents one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with the aging of the population and the lack of effective therapeutic options causing a rapid increase in the number of patients. The two most common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer’s disease, representing an estimated 60% to 70% of all dementias according to the World Health Organization, and Parkinson’s disease. In the United States, 5.7 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, as many as one million people suffer from Parkinson’s disease, and more than 20,000 patients suffer from ALS, according to estimates from the Alzheimer’s Association, the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, and the ALS Association, respectively. 
The cost to society from neurodegenerative disease is massive. The direct costs of caring for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in the United States were an estimated $277 billion in 2018, and are projected to increase to $1.1 trillion by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. In the United States, the total cost of care to patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias far exceeds that of many other diseases, including cancer. 
Our Scientific Strategy
We strictly follow our scientific strategy, which consists of three principles below, and we believe that this will increase our probability of success and accelerate development timelines: 
•Genetic pathway potential: selection of targets with a genetic link to disease;
•Engineering brain delivery: specifically designing therapeutics to cross the blood-brain barrier; and
•Biomarker-driven clinical development: Selecting the right patients, selecting the right dose, and monitoring effects of the drug in early clinical studies.
Genetic Pathway Potential
Advances in our understanding of the genetics, pathology and cell biology underlying chronic neurodegenerative diseases have identified pathways that trigger and/or contribute to disease onset and progression. Of particular importance is the progress in genetic sequencing where the dramatic reduction in the cost of genome sequencing has contributed to the discovery of numerous genetic mutations that have been linked to neurodegeneration (Figure 1). 

Figure 1: The number of associated genetic mutations linked to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS from 1991 to 2018. For genome-wide association studies, disease genes were selected based on genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8). Rare disease-causing and/or high penetrance mutations were included based on a p value of 1x10^-7 and replication in an independent cohort.
Human Genetics: Degenogenes
Prior to 2007, only a limited number of genetic mutations linked to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS had been identified. Since 2007, the number of genetic associations discovered in neurodegenerative diseases has grown rapidly, with more than 130 genes associated with these three neurodegenerative diseases collectively. These degenogenes directly point to important disease pathways that are disrupted in neurodegeneration, and are our scientific foundation for identifying and pursuing promising targets for drug development. We have chosen to initially focus on three such pathways: lysosomal function, glial biology and cellular homeostasis. 
Disease Pathways
Lysosomal Function
The lysosomal system, the disposal and recycling compartment of the cell, is involved in the digestion and processing of proteins and lipids in brain cells. Dysfunction of the lysosomal system is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and neurodegeneration in the context of lysosomal storage diseases ("LSDs"). Degenogenes linked to lysosomal function include LRRK2, aSyn, and lysosomal enzymes dysfunctional in LSDs, including IDS, and glucocerebrosidase ("GBA"). We believe therapeutics designed to correct lysosomal dysfunction are a promising approach to broadly treat neurodegeneration.
Glial Biology
The human brain contains several types of glial cells, which are non-neuronal cells that are important for protecting and supporting neuronal function, pruning neuronal synapses, and providing immune surveillance and response. A specific glial cell type, microglial cells, which are the macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, act as the resident immune system in the brain. Recently discovered degenogenes implicate immune dysfunction in microglial cells in patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. These genes include TREM2 and numerous other genes that are highly expressed in inflamed microglia. We believe the impact of immune modulation in neurodegeneration is a promising approach to treating disease. Genetic and pathological data suggest that reversing defects in glial biology may significantly delay or halt the progression of some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. Specifically, we and others have recently discovered that RIPK1, a kinase, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of a phosphate group to substrates, usually proteins, downstream of the TNF receptor pathway, a highly validated biologic target in human disease, is overactive in inflamed microglia and several other cells in the brain. Blocking RIPK1 may reverse the hyper-inflamed nature of glia and restore normal function. Improving glial function and modulating the resident immune system in the brain represents a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy. 
Cellular Homeostasis
Many degenogenes directly alter the homeostatic balance of brain cells. Specifically, defects in protein, ribonucleic acid ("RNA") or metabolic homeostasis lead to the death of neurons and dysfunction of the nervous system. This includes spreading of protein aggregates resulting in a proteinopathy, a characteristic finding in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases that results from disorders of protein synthesis, trafficking, folding, processing or degradation in cells. This also includes aggregation of RNA binding proteins disrupting cellular stress response in Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. The clearance of macromolecules in the brain is particularly susceptible to imbalances that result in aggregation and degeneration in nerve cells. For example, Alzheimer’s disease pathology is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques, which are accumulations of complex amyloid proteins deposited in tissues and neurofibrillary tangles, which are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein that are a marker of Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases known as tauopathies. We target this pathology with our ATV:Tau program and believe therapies that correct defects in cellular homeostasis have the potential to halt or delay neurodegenerative disease progression.
Engineering Brain Delivery
The Blood-Brain Barrier Challenge
The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from harmful substances in the blood stream by regulating the transfer of proteins, nutrients and waste products. The BBB consists of approximately 400 miles of blood vessels which are lined by closely linked endothelial cells. Delivery of therapeutics to the brain has been challenging as most small molecule drugs are actively excluded by efflux pumps, and brain uptake of therapeutic antibodies and recombinant enzymes is severely limited by their size (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: Schematic of the BBB. The specialized vessels of the brain represent a significant barrier for both small and large molecule therapeutics. Tight junctions between endothelial cells prevent the diffusion of large molecules while most small molecules are kept out of the brain by efflux pumps. 
The protective nature of the BBB limits the passive uptake of small molecule and large molecule therapeutics in the brain. For example, the concentration of most therapeutic antibodies in the brain is only 0.1% of the concentration in the blood. We believe that insufficient access of therapeutics to the brain due to the BBB is one of the major reasons for the low success rates of clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases to date. Engineering brain delivery of product candidates is therefore critical to our success in developing effective therapeutics for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Our product candidates are engineered to reach their intended targets in the brain at exposure levels that will provide a therapeutic effect, while having an acceptable safety profile. We do not plan to bring a product candidate into late-stage clinical testing unless it has shown sufficient brain concentration and target engagement in the brain in preclinical models and early-stage clinical trials. 
Engineering Large Molecule Brain Delivery
For large molecules, including therapeutic antibodies and enzymes, we are developing proprietary platform technologies to actively transport these molecules across the BBB through receptor-mediated transcytosis ("RMT"). RMT through the BBB is the process by which macromolecules in the blood bind to receptors on the endothelial cells that make up the BBB and are actively transported and released into the brain. Our large molecule transport vehicle ("TV") platform technology engineers BBB receptor binding into an Fc domain (Figure 3). We have selected transferrin receptor ("TfR"), which is a highly-expressed BBB receptor that we believe has the ability to substantially improve brain uptake of therapeutic molecules. This construct can be integrated and fused to therapeutic molecules as described below, without disrupting the binding of transferrin to TfR. 
Figure 3: Schematic of the BBB large molecule Transport Vehicle (TV) technology. The TV platform technology contains BBB receptor (TfR) binding in the Fc domain (A). The TV can be fused to Fab arms constituting the Antibody Transport Vehicle (ATV) technology (B). ATVs bind to TfR, enabling TfR-mediated transcytosis and brain uptake (C). 
Antibody Transport Vehicle
Our ATV platform technology utilizes the BBB receptor binding Fc domain to engineer bispecific and bivalent antibodies with improved brain delivery (Figure 4). 
 Figure 4: Schematic of receptor-mediated transport of ATV at the BBB. ATV molecules engage TfR on the blood vessel wall in the brain. Once bound, ATV is brought into vesicles that are transcytosed across the endothelial cell and released into the brain, thus substantially increasing antibody concentrations in brain. ATV binding to TfR does not disrupt the binding of transferrin to TfR. 
We have achieved in vivo proof of concept for the ATV platform in mice whose genomes have been engineered to express a portion of the human TfR gene at a specific location, or human TfR knock-in mice, and we have achieved in vivo proof of concept data in a study in nonhuman primates. 
In the human TfR knock-in mouse model, we have completed three preclinical studies designed to demonstrate proof of concept for the ATV platform. Such studies have demonstrated an average 20-fold increased antibody uptake in the brain, compared to a control antibody (Figure 5). 
As a result of a dramatic improvement in brain antibody uptake with the ATV, we observed a robust brain PD response, which is the biochemical and physiological effect of a drug, as measured by reduction in levels of amyloid beta in brain. This represents a highly disease-relevant proximal readout as amyloid beta levels are a primary driver of the amyloid plaque pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. These data demonstrate that the brain concentrations achieved with the ATV platform are in excess of levels needed to mediate a therapeutic response. Without the ATV, the control antibody was unable to have a desired PD effect in the brain (Figure 5). 
ATV-enabled antibodies also showed broad distribution in the brain, effectively crossing the BBB and associating with brain cells. Using brain imaging techniques, human IgG1 distribution was compared between a control anti-BACE1 antibody and ATV1:BACE1 (Figure 5). Images show robust localization of ATV1:BACE1 with cells in the brain after systemic delivery. These proof of concept data in a human TfR knock-in mouse model demonstrate the ability of ATV to achieve therapeutic concentrations and broad distribution in brain. 
Figure 5: ATV therapeutics achieve robust brain uptake and PD activity in human TfR knock-in mice. Mice were injected with 50 mg/kg of anti-BACE1 or ATV1:BACE1. After 24 hours of circulation, brain antibody concentrations were compared between anti-BACE1 (1.2nM) and ATV1:BACE1 (38.6nM) (A). A significant reduction in brain Abeta levels (57%) was observed for mice injected with ATV:BACE1 compared to anti-BACE1, where no reduction was observed as compared to untreated mice (B). Mice were injected with 50 mg/kg of anti-BACE1, ATV1:BACE1, ATV2:BACE1 or ATV3:BACE1. All ATV:BACE1 variants show a significant increase in brain uptake at 1 and 3 days post-dose as compared to anti-BACE1 (C). Significant brain Abeta reduction was observed for all ATV:BACE1 variants at 1 and 3 days post-dose, and for ATV3:BACE1 at 7 days post-dose, as compared to anti-BACE1 (D). Immunohistochemistry staining of brain sections from mice injected with either anti-BACE1 or ATV1:BACE1 24 hours post-dose. Robust and broad neuronal distribution of systemically administered ATV1: BACE1, but not anti-BACE1 is observed (E). HuIgG1 labels antibody; NeuN labels neurons; **** indicates p<0.0001. 
To further validate the ATV platform, we completed an in vivo study in nonhuman primates with an ATV designed to bind to cynomolgus monkey TfR (ATV4:BACE1). Data from this 28-day study demonstrated a robust and sustained brain PD response as measured from fluid taken from brains of living monkeys (Figure 6). When measuring drug activity in blood (plasma) versus brain (CSF), both anti-BACE1 and ATV4:BACE1 show robust activity in the blood, however only the ATV-enabled antibody (ATV4:BACE1) demonstrated robust and sustained PD activity in the nonhuman primate brain. We believe these in vivo proof of concept data in nonhuman primates provide support for the translatability of the ATV platform for human studies. 
Figure 6: ATV therapeutics achieve CNS PD activity in nonhuman primates. Cynomolgus monkeys were systemically injected with 30 mg/kg of control antibody, anti-BACE1, or ATV4:BACE1. In plasma, anti-BACE1 and ATV4:BACE1 equally reduce Abeta levels (A). In CSF, a robust and sustained reduction in CSF Abeta (B) and soluble APPbeta/APPalpha ratio (C) was observed in monkeys with ATV4:BACE1 compared to control antibody. In contrast, anti-BACE1 has minimal impact on CSF Abeta and APPbeta/APPalpha levels (C). 
Enzyme Transport Vehicle
Our ETV platform utilizes the same RMT approach as our ATV platform to deliver enzymes across the BBB. One potential application of this technology is the neurological component of LSDs. The ETV platform technology is an Fc enzyme fusion in which the TfR binding is engineered into the Fc domain (Figure 7). The high modularity of the platform makes it well suited for delivery of enzymes across the BBB. The ETV enables different fusion formats with one or two enzymes. The characteristics of the ETV platform are also applicable to proteins and peptides that may be fused to the platform for other indications. 
Figure 7: Engineering brain delivery using the ETV platform. The ETV platform technology contains BBB receptor (TfR) binding in the Fc domain (A) fused to an enzyme (B) to enable transport of enzymes into the brain through TfR-mediated transcytosis (C). 
Platform Technology Development and Applications
We are advancing our ATV and ETV platforms through further preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates. We are currently undertaking or plan to commence additional IND-enabling studies for multiple preclinical product candidates in 2019, including DNL310 (ETV:IDS) in Hunter Syndrome and ATV:aSyn in Parkinson's disease. We plan to file an IND or CTA for our first platform-enabled program, DNL310 (ETV:IDS) in late 2019. We are also combining our proprietary human TfR knock-in-mice model with disease-specific animal models in order to more precisely assess the potential of our platform-enabled therapeutic candidates in relevant disease models. We expect that this will give us the ability to perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ("PK/PD"), and efficacy studies and to quantitatively demonstrate the advantages of antibodies and proteins delivered using our platform technologies. To enable the development of our platform technologies, we have entered into a strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with F-star. For more information regarding our collaborations, see "Business - Licenses and Collaborations."
Engineering Small Molecule Brain Delivery
We are focused on engineering small molecule therapeutics that achieve exposure levels in the brain sufficient to bind to protein targets and drive a therapeutic effect. Efficacious orally administered small-molecule medicines for brain diseases must be readily absorbed from the gut into the blood and penetrate the BBB while avoiding transporter-mediated efflux (Figure 8). It has been estimated that approximately 98% of small molecule drugs do not cross the BBB. 
Figure 8: Generation of brain penetrant small molecules. The molecular properties compatible with CNS drugs are significantly more restricted than those generally used to design small molecule drugs, including tight restrictions on molecular weight and total polar surface area (A). This figure is not to scale. An example of how molecular properties influence brain penetration is shown in (B), where our lead RIPK1 inhibitor DNL747 displays a brain to blood ratio of ~0.8 while a benchmark periphery-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor displays a ratio of ~0.05. 
Our small molecule drug discovery scientists have many years of experience designing small molecules for brain diseases, including DNL151, one of our lead LRRK2 inhibitors, and DNL747, our lead RIPK1 inhibitor, both of which have demonstrated strong brain exposure and confirmed target engagement in preclinical and clinical studies.
Biomarker-Driven Clinical Development
We define biomarker goals at every phase of development, including prior to the filing of an IND. We focus on three biomarker-driven development principles: target engagement, pathway engagement and patient phenotyping. 
Biomarker discovery begins in early preclinical stages for each project. This early preclinical work provides a strong foundation for clinical biomarker work. In-depth investigations into target biology suggest biomarkers of target and pathway engagement that can be explored preclinically in cellular and animal models. Assessment of biomarkers in preclinical animal models enables elucidation of the relationship of target engagement in an accessible peripheral tissue (e.g. blood) and target engagement in the brain (e.g. brain and CSF). 
The preclinical biomarkers for target and pathway engagement can be tested in Phase 1 human healthy volunteer or patient studies to confirm translatability of the findings and assess CNS target engagement and its relationship to drug exposure. 
The disease relevance of these markers can also be evaluated in biosamples taken from the relevant patient population and then evaluated in patient studies to generate data linking target and pathway engagement to relevant effects on abnormal disease biology. This approach is intended to increase the likelihood of success in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical endpoint studies by enabling early dose finding in our clinical programs and streamlining overall clinical development. By utilizing biomarkers and genetic information, we can also better select the best patient population for our clinical trials and product candidates.
Our Portfolio
We are developing a broad portfolio of targeted therapeutic candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Our programs are at different stages of clinical and preclinical development. 
We continually evaluate new programs through our in-house discovery and partnering efforts and employ a rigorous process of prioritization and resource allocation to maintain an optimal balance between aggressively advancing existing programs, discontinuing programs which fail to meet key success criteria, and initiating new programs.
We discuss six of our programs in further detail below.
LRRK2 Inhibitor Program
The two most advanced LRRK2 product candidates are potent, selective and brain-penetrant small molecule inhibitors under investigation for treatment of Parkinson’s disease. DNL201 is in a Phase 1b clinical trial enrolling Parkinson’s disease patients both with and without a genetic LRRK2 mutation. DNL151 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers. 
Therapeutic Rationale
Lysosomal dysfunction is a central pathology of Parkinson’s disease. Genetic mutations in several proteins associated with Parkinson’s disease, including LRRK2, GBA and aSyn, disrupt normal lysosomal function and contribute to neurodegeneration and the formation of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular aggregates containing aSyn proteins (Figure 9). LRRK2 regulates lysosomal function by phosphorylating Rab proteins, which control intracellular lysosomal trafficking (Figure 10). Mutations in the LRRK2 gene that cause Parkinson’s disease increase LRRK2 kinase activity leading to excessive phosphorylation of Rab proteins, thereby disrupting normal lysosomal movement and maturation. Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity with a LRRK2 kinase inhibitor reduces Rab phosphorylation and restores normal lysosomal function.

Figure 9: Lysosomal dysfunction is a central pathology in Parkinson’s disease and leads to protein aggregation of aSyn and Lewy bodies and the death of dopaminergic neurons. LRRK2 acts in healthy cells to maintain normal lysosomal function. Excessive LRRK2 activation or expression reduces lysosomal function and contributes to the progression of Parkinson’s disease. Lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease can also be caused by other genetic factors as well as environmental factors. LRRK2 inhibition can restore normal lysosomal function and reduce toxicity in Parkinson’s disease models.
 Figure 10. Phosphorylated Rabs are a novel marker of LRRK2 activity. Multiple distinct LRRK2 mutations result in elevated phosphorylation of the downstream marker Rab10 (A), while inhibition of LRRK2 results in a dose-dependent inhibition of Rab10 phosphorylation that is comparable to the inhibition of LRRK2 phosphorylation on Serine 935 (B). 
Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity has been shown to be beneficial in several cellular and in vivo models. The most common LRRK2 mutation, G2019S, is a point mutation that results in increased kinase activity, abnormal lysosomal biology and an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. LRRK2 G2019S expression in cells from transgenic mice or other cell lines reduces the lysosomal capacity of the cell, leading to decreased lysosomal function. These defects are dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity, and treatment with DNL201 rescues the observed lysosomal phenotype. LRRK2 G2019S expression in neurons leads to a similar lysosomal phenotype and also results in reduced neurite outgrowth, an effect that can be rescued with LRRK2 kinase inhibition. 
Pharmacological Properties and Brain Exposure
We have a broad portfolio of potent, selective and brain-penetrant LRRK2 inhibitors with attractive pharmacological properties. The pharmacology of both lead LRRK2 product candidates, DNL201 and DNL151, has been investigated in a broad range of biochemical and cell-based in vitro assays, and both molecules have been shown to inhibit LRRK2 activity with low nanomolar potency in human blood cells.
Both DNL201 and DNL151 displayed comparable potency of LRRK2 inhibition in blood cells taken from LRRK2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, with a small apparent increase in potency in cells from G2019S mutation carriers (Figure 11). 
Figure 11. Treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from LRRK2 mutation carriers and healthy control non-carriers with our LRRK2 inhibitors. Both DNL201 (A) and DNL151 (B) demonstrated a small increase in potency in PBMCs from G2019S mutation carriers. 
Biomarker-Driven Development 
We have developed assays that measure pS935 LRRK2 and pRab10 phosphorylation as markers of LRRK2 kinase activity to demonstrate target engagement in humans. Phosphorylation of LRRK2 at serine 935 ("pS935") is a well-established biomarker of LRRK2 kinase activity that has been demonstrated to respond to pharmacological inhibition. Rab10 is a member of the Rab GTPase family involved in endolysosomal function and is a direct substrate of LRRK2 kinase. 
To provide greater insight into the effects of LRRK2 inhibitors on lysosomal biology in humans, in addition to pRab10 phosphorylation, we have measured BMP di22:6 in urine and CSF of subjects treated with LRRK2 inhibitors. BMP di22:6 is a lysosomal lipid biomarker that indicates changes in lysosome function associated with LRRK2 inhibition. 
Results of phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers 
The DNL201 Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers completed in July 2018. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial in 105 healthy young and 17 healthy elderly subjects to investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of DNL201 and characterize the PK and PD of DNL201 in plasma and CSF. 
Safety
DNL201 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events at doses that achieved high levels of CSF exposure and effects on biomarkers of lysosomal function. All treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were mild or moderate in severity. In the single ascending dose (“SAD”) study, single doses from 10 mg to 225 mg were evaluated, and in the multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study, multiple doses from 40 mg once daily and 25 mg to 150/100 mg twice daily were evaluated. The most common TEAs in the MAD study were headache, dizziness, and nausea.
At the highest doses studied, small Cmax related mean increases in pulse rate and mild decreases in blood pressure were observed, but were generally well tolerated. There were no clinically meaningful changes on ECGs, neurological exams, safety laboratories, renal parameters or pulmonary function tests. Overall, the maximum tolerated multiple dose was 100 mg BID, and in the healthy elderly cohort a dose of 80 mg BID was studied and was generally well tolerated. These data supported the advancement of DNL201 into a Phase1b study in Parkinson patients with and without a LRRK2 mutation. 
Pharmacokinetics
The PK profile of DNL201 was well behaved and CSF/unbound plasma ratios reflected extensive distribution of DNL201 into the CNS.

Target and Pathway Engagement
Dose- and exposure-dependent reductions of both pS935 LRRK2 and pRab10 were observed following administration of well-tolerated doses of DNL201 in healthy volunteers, including healthy elderly subjects. 
Figure 13: DNL201 dose-dependent inhibition of LRRK2 in healthy subjects as measured by phosphorylation of LRRK2 on Serine 935 in blood samples collected on Day 1 and Day 10 of dosing. 50% inhibition at trough (Day 10 12 hours post-dose) was achieved in the 40 mg BID group, demonstrating that doses greater than or equal to 40 mg BID are therapeutically relevant.

Vertical dashed lines show >50% inhibition at trough (Day 10 12 hours post-dose) and >80% inhibition at Cmax (Day 10 3 hours post-dose) in the 40 mg BID group. Greater inhibition at trough and Cmax was achieved in higher dosed cohorts. 
Future Development Plan
In December 2018, we initiated a Phase 1b study of DNL201 Parkinson’s disease patients with and without LRRK2 mutations. The primary objectives of this trial are to evaluate safety, PK and PD of DNL201 in LRRK2 patients to identify the optimal dose(s) to study in future Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, and confirm relevant biomarkers. In addition to ongoing clinical studies, we have engaged Centogene to conduct a targeted global recruitment campaign focused on the early identification and characterization of LRRK2 PD patients and sequence the LRRK2 gene in these patients, to enroll in future clinical studies.
The Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers for DNL151 is ongoing and we expect to complete this study in 2019.
RIPK1 Inhibitor Program
The most advanced product candidate in our RIPK1 inhibitor program, DNL747, is a potent, selective and brain-penetrant small molecule RIPK1 inhibitor. As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, we are collaborating with Sanofi on the RIPK1 inhibitor program in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and multiple sclerosis ("MS"). We commenced DNL747 Phase 1b clinical trial in December 2018 for ALS and in February 2019 for Alzheimer’s disease. 
Therapeutic Rationale
Aberrant glial biology characterized by neuro-immune dysfunction is a cardinal feature of the pathology of many chronic neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. Genome wide association studies ("GWAS") identified that a large proportion of genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease are expressed almost exclusively by microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, thus implicating microglia as an important effector of neurodegeneration. ALS-causing mutations in optineurin ("OPTN") result in increased RIPK1 activity in microglia, while two additional ALS-risk genes, Tank Binding Kinase ("TBK") and TNFAIP3-interacting protein 1 ("TNIP1"), regulate RIPK1 signaling in cell-based experiments and in preclinical animal models. 
Stimulation of RIPK1 signaling in cultured microglia produces cytokines and other pro-inflammatory factors, including CCL2 ("MCP-1"), IL-1b, and IL-6, while treatment with RIPK1 inhibitors attenuates induction of these factors. Production of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated microglia can exacerbate tissue damage and neuronal death. An increase in RIPK1 has been observed both in the brains of animal models of chronic neurodegeneration and patients with Alzheimer’s disease that is correlated with microglial cell activation, suggesting RIPK1 activation is increased in disease.
In addition to the role of RIPK1 in neuroinflammation, the RIPK1 pathway is also a central regulator of necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. The role of RIPK1 in necroptosis of neurons has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, providing another potential pathway where inhibition may be beneficial in disease. 
Biomarker-Driven Development 
Target engagement has been characterized using a marker of RIPK1 activity, phosphorylation of RIPK1 at Serine166 (pS166). This biomarker has been characterized in in vitro assays in human and monkey PBMCs and has been demonstrated to be robustly reduced by RIPK1 inhibitors.
Results of phase 1 clinical study in healthy volunteers 
The Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers was completed in November 2018. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center clinical trial in 56 healthy subjects to investigate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of DNL747 and characterize the PK and PD of DNL747 in plasma and CSF. 
Safety
DNL747 was well tolerated to the highest doses tested with no serious adverse events at doses that achieved high levels of brain exposure and robust target engagement as measured by pS166 activity. Across both the SAD and MAD portions of the study there were 42 healthy subjects who received at least one dose of active DNL747, with no serious adverse events and no discontinuations due to study drug exposure. The majority of TEAEs were mild (92%) with the rest of moderate severity. 
Pharmacokinetics
The PK profile of DNL747 was well behaved and CSF/unbound plasma ratios reflected extensive distribution of DNL747 into the CNS. 
Figure 15: Left: Mean pharmacokinetic profiles of DNL747 at steady-state (Day 14), following oral 100, 200, or 400 mg BID doses to healthy volunteers. Right: CSF:plasma ratio of DNL747 concentrations at steady-state (Day 12), 4 hours post-dose, all dose groups combined. No effects of dose were observed.
Target and Pathway Engagement
A robust, dose-dependent reduction of RIPK1 at pS166 was observed following administration of DNL747 in healthy volunteers at all three doses.
Figure 16: DNL747 dose-dependent inhibition of RIPK1 in healthy subjects as measured by RIPK1 Serine166 phosphorylation change in PBMCs in the multiple-ascending dose cohorts. Nearly 90% inhibition up to 12hrs is achieved with all three doses at the steady state of the dosing period. 
Future Development Plan
 In partnership with Sanofi, we commenced DNL747 Phase 1b clinical trial in December 2018 for ALS and in February 2019 for Alzheimer’s disease. These are randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, cross-over designed studies. The primary objectives of these patient studies are to evaluate safety, PK and PD of DNL747 in Alzheimer’s disease and ALS patients, to confirm evidence of target engagement in patients and confirm relevant biomarkers. 
We are working with Sanofi to define the future clinical development plans for our RIPK1 inhibitor molecules in ALS, MS and Alzheimer’s disease. 
Other RIPK1 Compounds 
As part of our parallel development strategy, we have also developed a number of other structurally diverse CNS-penetrant and peripherally-restricted RIPK1 inhibitor molecules, which are included as part of the collaboration agreement with Sanofi. After DNL747, the most advanced RIPK1 inhibitor molecule is DNL758, a Peripheral Product candidate for which IND-enabling studies have been completed. Sanofi will lead clinical development activities with DNL758 for all systemic inflammatory diseases. The clinical trials are expected to begin in 2019.
ETV:IDS Enzyme Replacement Therapy Program
We are developing ETV:IDS as a treatment for the lysosomal storage disorder MPS II. MPS II, also known as Hunter Syndrome, is an X-linked recessive genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by a single gene defect leading to a deficiency in the enzyme IDS. IDS is essential for the breakdown of the glycosaminoglycans ("GAGs"), heparan and dermatan sulfate, and its deficiency results in a toxic accumulation of GAGs and perturbed lysosomal function. Approximately two-thirds of MPS II patients suffer from the neuropathic form of the disease, which is characterized by intellectual disability and a progressive cognitive decline that emerges between three and five years of age. MPS II is currently treated with intravenous infusions of recombinant IDS protein. These treatments do not efficiently distribute to the brain and, therefore, cannot address the neurological manifestations of the disease. There is a demonstrated need for therapies that effectively cross the BBB so as to treat both neurological and peripheral manifestations of MPS II and other LSDs.
Using our TV technology, we have engineered therapeutic fusion proteins that effectively deliver IDS across the BBB into brain tissue in addition to distribution in the rest of the body. Our lead ETV:IDS candidate, DNL310, is currently in IND-enabling studies, and we plan to file an IND or CTA in late 2019.
We have achieved in vivo proof of concept for the ETV:IDS program in a mouse model of MPS II disease. ETV:IDS robustly lowered GAGs in the liver and spleen at levels comparable to idursulfase, a recombinant IDS protein and currently the standard of care for Hunter Syndrome. Importantly, we demonstrated that ETV:IDS was also highly effective in lowering GAGs in the brain, which was not achieved with conventional recombinant IDS as it does not cross through the BBB. The robust GAG reduction observed in brain translated to correction of downstream disease-relevant pathology as treatment with ETV:IDS resulted in a complete correction of lysosomal lipid accumulation and reduction in levels of TREM2, a marker of microglia activity, in the brain.
Figure 17: ETV:IDS reduces GAGs in the periphery of IDS KO; TfRmu/hu KI mice at the same level as conventional recombinant IDS. ETV:IDS has a superior effect in the brain and CSF while conventional recombinant IDS does not reduce GAGs in the brain. 
Figure 18: ETV:IDS corrects downstream pathology including lysosomal lipid storage and microglial activation, while conventional recombinant IDS does not have an effect of downstream pathology. 
ATV:aSyn Program
ATV:aSyn is a therapeutic candidate targeting alpha Synuclein, a protein that pathologically accumulates, aggregates and spreads throughout the brain in Parkinson’s disease. Lysosomal dysfunction in neurons can contribute to aSyn aggregation, which results in the formation of Lewy bodies, which are one of the defining neuropathological characteristic of Parkinson’s disease, and ultimately cell death. Further, aSyn is a degenogene, as mutations in this gene lead to an increased risk for Parkinson’s disease. 
        Our ATV:aSyn candidates are currently in preclinical development, and we expect to file an IND or CTA in 2020. Following proof of concept in Parkinson’s disease, we may also explore clinical development for patients with other synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy.
ATV:TREM2 Program
ATV:TREM2 is a therapeutic candidate designed to rescue microglial function in Alzheimer’s disease through modulating the activity of TREM2, a degenogene. A major component of Alzheimer’s disease pathology is the presence of neuro-immune dysfunction. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, show signs of activation and release of toxic cytokines in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In 2013, a rare variant of TREM2 was found to be associated with a three-fold higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease onset, which strongly implicates TREM2 as a functional contributor to disease progression. 
We have developed high affinity antibodies for TREM2 and are currently characterizing antibodies in order to select a lead to couple with our proprietary ATV platform. We plan to file an IND or CTA for this program in 2021. 
As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, Takeda has the right to opt in to our ATV:TREM2 program. 
ATV:Tau Program
ATV:Tau is a therapeutic targeting the spreading of Tau, a protein that when misfolded, forms neurofibrillary tangles. This pathology is a consequence of protein aggregation, a form of disrupted cellular homeostasis, eventually leading to neuronal degeneration. Tau is believed to regulate microtubule stability in neurons, but it can also aggregate to form neurofibrillary tangles present in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease.
We have developed high affinity antibodies for Tau and are currently optimizing the lead molecule on our proprietary ATV platform. We believe our ATV:Tau program will target a primary hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease with improved target engagement compared to competitors based on unique epitope and enhanced brain penetration. We plan to file an IND or CTA in 2021.
The ATV:Tau program replaces the ATV:BACE1/Tau program, which was discontinued based on emerging clinical data demonstrating that small molecule inhibitors of BACE1 may worsen cognition. As described in more detail in “Business - Licenses and Collaborations” below, Takeda has the right to opt in to our ATV:Tau program.
Licenses and Collaborations 
Takeda Option and Collaboration Agreement
Overview
In January 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Takeda ("Takeda Collaboration Agreement"), pursuant to which we granted Takeda an option with respect to our ATV:BACE1/Tau program, our ATV:TREM2 program, and a third identified, but yet undisclosed discovery stage program. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement provided that Takeda pay a $40.0 million upfront payment, which was received in February 2018. The Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective in February 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 were satisfied. In February 2019, we amended the agreement to replace ATV:BACE1/Tau with ATV:Tau. 
Research Phase and Takeda’s Option
Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement and unless we otherwise agree jointly with Takeda, we will be responsible, at our cost, for conducting activities relating to pre-IND development of biologic products directed to the three identified targets and enabled by our BBB delivery technology targeting transferrin receptor during the applicable option period. The option period continues for each target until the first biologic product candidate directed to the relevant target is IND-ready or about five years after selection of the target, whichever is earlier.
Takeda is obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $25.0 million with respect to each program under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement directed to a target and based upon the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events, up to $75.0 million in total, of which $5.0 million was received when the Takeda Collaboration Agreement became effective. Additional payments totaling $10.0 million became due based on the achievement of certain preclinical milestone events in 2018, of which $5.0 million was received in November 2018 and $5.0 million was received in February 2019. 
Collaboration Activities Following Takeda’s Option Exercise
If Takeda exercises its option with respect to a particular target and collaboration program (i.e., the biologic products directed to the target for which Takeda has exercised its option), then Takeda will have the right to develop and commercialize, jointly with us, a specified number of biologic products enabled by our blood-brain barrier delivery technology that were developed during the option period and which are directed to the relevant target, and we will grant to Takeda a co-exclusive license under the intellectual property we control related to those biologic products.
Takeda is obligated to pay us a $5.0 million option fee for each target for which Takeda exercises its option, up to $15.0 million in total.
In addition, Takeda will be obligated to pay us up to an aggregate of $707.5 million upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestone events if Takeda exercises its option for all three collaboration programs. Further, Takeda will be obligated to pay us up to $75.0 million per biologic product upon achievement of a certain sales-based milestone, or an aggregate of $225.0 million if one biologic product from each program achieves the milestone.
After Takeda exercises its option for a particular target, we and Takeda will share equally the development and commercialization costs, and, if applicable, the profits, for each collaboration program. However, for each collaboration program, we may elect not to continue sharing development and commercialization costs, or Takeda may elect to terminate our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations if, following notice from Takeda and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost sharing obligations with respect to the relevant collaboration program. After such an election by us or termination by Takeda becomes effective, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the relevant collaboration program, and we will not share in any profits from that collaboration program. Instead we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties. The royalty rates will be in the low- to mid-teen percentages on net sales, or low- to high-teen percentages on net sales if we have met a certain co-funding threshold at the time of our election to opt out of co-development or Takeda’s termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations, and, in each case, these royalty rates will be subject to certain reductions specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda will pay these royalties to us for each biologic product included in the relevant collaboration program, on a country-by-country basis, until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant biologic product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that biologic product, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that biologic product in the applicable country, unless biosimilar competition in excess of a significant level specified in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement occurs earlier, in which case Takeda’s royalty obligations in the applicable country would terminate.
For each collaboration program for which we are sharing costs and profits with Takeda, we will lead the conduct of clinical activities for each indication up to the first Phase 2 trial with a clinical outcomes-based efficacy endpoints, and Takeda will lead the conduct of all subsequent clinical activities for that indication. For each collaboration program for which we are sharing costs and profits with Takeda, we and Takeda will jointly commercialize biologic products included in the relevant collaboration program in the United States and China. Unless we have opted out of cost-sharing for two collaboration programs, we have the right to lead commercialization activities in the United States for one collaboration program and Takeda will lead commercialization activities in the United States for all collaboration programs for which we do not lead commercialization activities. Further, Takeda will lead commercialization activities in China and will solely conduct commercialization activities in all other countries.
We have the right to lead all manufacturing activities for all collaboration programs for which the parties are sharing costs and profits.
Exclusivity
During the option period for a particular target and, if the applicable option is exercised by Takeda (unless the Takeda Collaboration Agreement is terminated earlier), until expiration of an agreed period of time after the first regulatory approval in the United States or Europe of a biologic product within the applicable collaboration program, neither party may conduct clinical or commercial activities involving antibodies or protein-based therapeutic products directed to the same target (or in the case of a bi-specific program, the same combination of targets) that have an intended therapeutic effect in diseases and conditions of the CNS (including lysosomal storage diseases), except to the extent permitted under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
Termination
Each party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to a particular collaboration program, as applicable, if the other party remains in material breach of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or with respect to any particular collaboration program, for convenience and after giving a specified amount of prior notice to us, but Takeda may not do so for a certain period of time after the Effective Date of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. Takeda may also terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to any collaboration program if the joint steering committee established under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement unanimously agrees that a material safety event has occurred with respect to the applicable collaboration program. We may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular collaboration program if Takeda fails to conduct material development and commercial activities for a specified period of time with respect to a collaboration program, unless Takeda cures such failure within a certain period of time. We and Takeda may each terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress or if, subject to a specified cure period, the other party challenges any patents licensed to it under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement.
Following any termination of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular collaboration program or the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, our rights to each terminated collaboration program will revert to us, Takeda will grant us a license to intellectual property owned by Takeda with respect to such collaboration program (which could be subject to certain royalty payments that would be negotiated at the time of such a termination) and, unless the termination was by Takeda on the basis of a material safety event, Takeda will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization wind-down activities.
Common Stock Purchase Agreement
Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Takeda in January 2018, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Takeda agreed to purchase, 4,214,559 shares of our common stock (the “Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $110.0 million pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof. We closed the sale of the Shares to Takeda in February 2018.
We and Takeda also entered into a standstill and stock restriction agreement (the “Standstill Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Standstill Agreement, Takeda agreed to certain transfer and standstill restrictions, including a restriction on acquiring more than 10% of our capital stock, for a specified period of time following the closing of the sale of the Shares to Takeda, or earlier upon our change of control or, with respect to the transfer restrictions, termination of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement. In addition, Takeda is entitled to certain registration rights with respect to the Shares following termination of the transfer restrictions if the Shares cannot be resold without restriction pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Sanofi Collaboration and License Agreement 
Overview 
On October 29, 2018, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Genzyme Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi S.A. ("Sanofi") pursuant to which certain small molecule compounds that bind to and inhibit RIPK1 (“RIPK1 Inhibitors”) contributed by Sanofi and by Denali will be developed and commercialized. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018 when the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 were satisfied.
Denali and Sanofi plan to jointly develop products containing RIPK1 Inhibitors for neurological indications, such as Alzheimer’s disease, ALS and MS, and Sanofi plans to develop and commercialize products containing RIPK1 Inhibitors for systemic inflammatory indications, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement includes Denali’s and Sanofi’s RIPK1 Inhibitors that measurably penetrate the blood-brain barrier ("CNS Products"), and Denali’s and Sanofi’s RIPK1 Inhibitors that do not measurably penetrate the blood-brain barrier ("Peripheral Products"). The two most advanced RIPK1 Inhibitors in the collaboration are DNL747, a CNS Product that was discovered by Denali and is currently in two Phase 1b studies in patients with ALS and Alzheimer’s disease, and DNL758, a Peripheral Product discovered by Denali for which IND-enabling studies have been completed.
License Grant 
Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, we granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide license under intellectual property that we control related to Denali’s RIPK1 Inhibitors, including certain intellectual property licensed to us by an academic institution. 
Payments 
When the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement became effective in November 2018, Sanofi paid us$125.0 million upfront. Under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi is required to make milestone payments up to approximately $1.1 billion upon achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestone events. Such milestone payments include $600.0 million in clinical and regulatory milestone payments for CNS Products and $495.0 million in clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for Peripheral Products. 
Denali will share profits and losses equally with Sanofi for CNS Products sold in the United States and China, and receive royalties on net sales for CNS Products outside of the United States and China and for Peripheral Products sold worldwide, each as further described below. 
RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by Sanofi and developed and commercialized under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement will be subject to lower milestone and royalty payments to us compared to RIPK1 Inhibitors contributed by us. We will also retain responsibility for certain payment obligations under our agreement with an academic institution which licensed certain intellectual property to us that we are sublicensing to Sanofi under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Program for Development and Commercialization of CNS Products 
Denali and Sanofi will jointly develop CNS Products pursuant to a global development plan ("CNS Development Plan"). We will be responsible, at our cost, for the conduct of Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products for Alzheimer’s disease and any activities required to support such clinical trials and specific for Alzheimer’s disease. We are conducting and will complete, at Sanofi’s cost, a Phase 1b trial for DNL747 for ALS. Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for all other Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for CNS Products, including for multiple sclerosis. Sanofi will lead Phase 3 and later stage development trials for CNS Products, with Sanofi funding 70% of such costs and Denali funding 30% of such costs. The Sanofi Collaboration Agreement contains certain protections for us with respect to Phase 3 development costs not included in the initial budget for the CNS Development Plan agreed by the parties, including a deferral mechanism for costs incurred above the budgeted amounts for such trials and for costs incurred in respect of Phase 3 and other clinical trials not contemplated in the initial CNS Development Plan. In addition, we have the ability to opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as further described below.
Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for CNS Products. We may elect to conduct certain co-commercialization activities outside of MS with respect to each CNS Product in the United States and/or China, provided that the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for the relevant CNS Product are still in effect, as further described below.
We may opt out of the cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for CNS Products in the United States and China on a CNS product-by-CNS Product and country-by-country basis. Sanofi may also terminate our cost-profit sharing provisions of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement  in its entirety if, following notice from Sanofi and a cure period, we fail to satisfy our cost-sharing obligations. After such an opt out by us or termination by Sanofi, we will no longer be obligated to share in the development and commercialization costs for the applicable CNS Products and we will not share in the applicable profits from such CNS Products. Instead, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties on net sales of the applicable CNS Products in the relevant country (or countries). The royalty rates will be a percentage in the low double digits to mid-teens, but may increase to the mid-teens to low-twenties percentages for all countries in which Sanofi is paying royalties on the applicable CNS Products, if we have met certain co-funding thresholds at the time of our election or Sanofi’s termination of our cost-profit sharing rights and obligations.
Program for Development and Commercialization of Peripheral Products 
Sanofi will be responsible, at its cost, for conducting activities relating to the development and commercialization of all Peripheral Products. 
Sanofi will lead commercialization activities globally for Peripheral Products. We will be entitled to receive tiered royalties in the low- to mid- teen percentages on net sales of Peripheral Products. 
Manufacturing 
Sanofi will be responsible for delivering all supplies for clinical trials and commercial production for CNS Products and Peripheral Products, except that we will deliver such supplies for the currently in-progress Phase 1b trials for DNL747 and currently-planned Phase 1 trials for DNL758. 
Royalty Term 
For any CNS Product with respect to any country for which Sanofi is required to pay royalties on net sales and for each Peripheral Product, Sanofi will pay royalties to us on a country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of certain patents covering the relevant product, (ii) the expiration of all regulatory exclusivity for that product in the applicable country, and (iii) an agreed period of time after the first commercial sale of that product in the applicable country. If, in a particular country, a CNS Product for which Sanofi is required to pay royalties or a Peripheral Product is not covered by specified patent rights in that country or net sales in that country decrease below specified thresholds as a result of generic competition, Sanofi’s royalty obligations in the applicable country would be reduced or would terminate as specified in the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Exclusivity 
During the term of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, neither Denali nor Sanofi may conduct IND-enabling, clinical or commercial activities involving any RIPK1 Inhibitor, anywhere in the world, unless the RIPK1 Inhibitor is included by Denali or Sanofi, as the case may be, under the collaboration and only to the extent such activity is permitted under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement. 
Termination 
Each party may terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, or with respect to a particular program (i.e., the CNS Products program or Peripheral Products program), as applicable, if the other party remains in material breach of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement following a cure period to remedy the material breach. After giving a specified amount of prior notice to us, Sanofi may terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement for convenience in its entirety, with respect to any particular program, or with respect to one or more specified regions of the world. Sanofi may also terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with respect to any program or a particular RIPK1 Inhibitor if a material safety event has occurred and cessation of all development and commercialization of all RIPK1 Inhibitors in the affected program or the affected RIPK1 Inhibitor is recommended. Denali and Sanofi may each terminate the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety if the other party is declared insolvent or in similar financial distress or if, subject to a specified cure period, the other party challenges any patents licensed to it under the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement.
Following any termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement with respect to a particular program or a particular region (or regions) of the world or termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement in its entirety, our rights to each of our RIPK1 Inhibitors that were licensed to Sanofi will revert to us. Sanofi will conduct certain development, manufacturing and commercialization activities on a transitional basis following termination of the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement, as outlined in the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement or agreed by Sanofi, depending upon the basis for the applicable termination.
If the Sanofi Collaboration Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by Sanofi for our material uncured breach, our insolvency or our challenge to any of the patents licensed to us by Sanofi, Sanofi will grant us an exclusive license to certain intellectual property controlled by Sanofi with respect to such RIPK1 Inhibitors (which could be subject to low single digit royalties payable to Sanofi).
F-star License and Collaboration Agreement
Overview
In August 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with F-star Gamma Limited, F-star Biotechnologische Forschungs-und Entwicklungsges m.b.H and F-star Biotechnology Limited (collectively "F-star"). The goal of the collaboration was the development of certain constant Fc domains of an antibody with non-native antigen binding activity, or Fcabs, to enhance delivery of therapeutics across the BBB into the brain. The collaboration was designed to leverage F-star’s modular antibody technology and our expertise in the development of therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In connection with the entry into the F-star collaboration agreement, we also purchased an option for an upfront option fee of $0.5 million, which we refer to as the buy-out-option, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma pursuant to a pre-negotiated buy-out option agreement. 
On May 30, 2018, we exercised such buy-out option and entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with the shareholders of F-star Gamma and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding shares of F-star Gamma (the “Acquisition”). 
As a result of the Acquisition, F-star Gamma has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and we changed the entity’s name to Denali BBB Holding Limited. In addition, we became a direct licensee of certain intellectual property of F-star Ltd (by way of the Company’s assumption of F-star Gamma’s license agreement with F-star Ltd, dated August 24, 2016, (the “F-star Gamma License”)). We made initial exercise payments under the Purchase Agreement and the F-star Gamma License in the aggregate, of $18.0 million, less the net liabilities of F-star Gamma, which is approximately $0.2 million. In addition, we are required to make future contingent payments, to F-star Ltd and the former shareholders of F-star Gamma, up to a maximum amount of $447.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain defined preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. The amount of the contingent payments varies based on whether F-star delivers an Fcab (constant Fc-domains with antigen-binding activity) that meets pre-defined criteria and whether the Fcab has been identified solely by us or solely by F-star or jointly by us and F-star.
Under the terms of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement, we could nominate up to three Fcab targets (“Accepted Fcab Targets”) within the first three years of the date of the F-star Collaboration Agreement. Upon entering into the F-star Collaboration Agreement, we had selected transferrin receptor (“TfR”) as the first Accepted Fcab Target and paid F-star Gamma an upfront fee of $5.5 million, which included selection of the first Accepted Fcab Target. In May 2018, we exercised our right to nominate two additional Fcab Targets and identified a second Accepted Fcab Target. We made a one-time payment for the two additional Accepted Fcab Targets of, in the aggregate, $6.0 million and have extended the time period for our selection of the third Accepted Fcab Target until approximately the fourth anniversary of the date of the original F-star Collaboration Agreement.
We are also responsible for certain research costs incurred by F-star Ltd in conducting activities under each agreed development plan, for up to 24 months. These research costs for the agreed TfR development plan were up to $2.1 million.
Genentech Exclusive License Agreement
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genentech. The agreement gives us access to Genentech’s LRRK2 small molecule program. Under the agreement, Genentech granted us (i) an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under Genentech’s rights to certain patents and patent applications directed to small molecule compounds which bind to and inhibit LRRK2 and (ii) a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license to certain related know-how, in each case, to develop and commercialize certain compounds and licensed products incorporating any such compound. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts during the first three years of the agreement to research, develop and commercialize at least one licensed product.

Our financial obligations under the agreement with Genentech included an upfront payment of $8.5 million and a technology transfer fee of $1.5 million. In addition, we may owe Genentech milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, up to a maximum of $315.0 million in the aggregate. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties on net sales of licensed products ranging from low to high single-digit percentages, with the exact royalty rate dependent on various factors, including (i) whether the compound incorporated in the relevant licensed product is a Genentech-provided compound or a compound acquired or developed by us, (ii) the date a compound was first discovered, derived or optimized by us, (iii) the existence of patent rights covering the relevant licensed product in the relevant country, (iv) the existence of orphan drug exclusivity covering a licensed product that is a Genentech-provided compound and (v) the level of annual net sales of the relevant licensed product. We also have the right to credit a certain amount of third-party royalty and milestone payments against royalty and milestone payments owed to Genentech, but such credit cannot reduce our royalty obligation to Genentech by more than fifty percent. Our royalty payment obligations will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon the later of (a) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country or (b) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country. If one of our licensed products incorporates a compound provided to us by Genentech, has orphan drug exclusivity, and is not covered by a valid claim of a licensed patent, we must pay royalties on net sales of such licensed products on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until such orphan drug exclusivity in such country expires, but our obligation to pay these royalties may be eliminated or reduced if there is a clinically superior product marketed in such country.
Unless earlier terminated, our agreement with Genentech will continue in effect until all of our royalty and milestone payment obligations to Genentech expire. Following expiration of the agreement, we will retain our licenses under the intellectual property Genentech licensed to us on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis. Genentech may terminate the agreement if we challenge any of the patent rights licensed to us by Genentech, or if we materially breach the agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or enter into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. If Genentech terminates the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency after we have made a milestone payment to Genentech, then we are obligated to grant to Genentech an exclusive right of first negotiation with respect to certain of our patents, know-how and regulatory filings directed to Genentech-provided compounds. We do not have the right to terminate the agreement without cause, but may terminate the agreement for Genentech’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. 
Manufacturing
We believe it is important to our business and success to have a reliable, high-quality preclinical and clinical drug supply. As we mature as a company and approach commercial stage operations, securing reliable high-quality commercial drug supply will be critical. 
We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage, distribution or testing. 
We rely on third-party contract manufacturers ("CMOs"), to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials to be used during the development of our product candidates. We have established relationships with several CMOs, including Lonza Sales AG ("Lonza"). Effective September 2017, we entered into a development and manufacturing services agreement with Lonza, which agreement we have subsequently amended to add scope of work under this agreement. We refer to this agreement, as amended, as the DMSA or the Lonza agreement. Pursuant to the Lonza agreement, Lonza agreed to provide clinical development and manufacturing services with respect to certain of our biologic products on a fee-for-service basis. 
We currently do not need commercial manufacturing capacity. When and if this becomes relevant, we intend to evaluate both third-party manufacturers as well as building out internal capabilities and capacity. 
Commercialization Plan
We do not currently have any approved drugs and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. Therefore, we have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing drugs.
When and if any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to develop a commercialization infrastructure for those products in the United States and potentially in certain other key markets, including China. For commercial activities in the rest of the world, we expect to rely on partnerships, including those with Takeda and Sanofi, to provide commercialization infrastructure, including sales and marketing and commercial distribution. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the neurodegenerative disease field, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, strong competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates will include efficacy, safety profile, method of administration, cost, level of promotional activity and intellectual property protection.
Our product candidates will compete with current therapies approved for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, which to date have been primarily targeted at treating the symptoms of such diseases rather than halting or slowing the progression of the disease. However, in addition to such currently approved therapies, we believe that our product candidates, if approved, may also compete with other potential therapies intended to halt or slow the progression of neurodegenerative disease that are being developed by a number of companies and institutions, including but not limited to:
•Alzheimer’s Disease: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Biogen, Eli Lilly, Eisai, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Roche (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary), and Alector in various stages of clinical trials.
•Parkinson’s Disease: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Prothena, Roche, Voyager Therapeutics, Sage Therapeutics, Sanofi, Biogen, AstraZeneca and Lundbeck in various stages of clinical trials.
•ALS: Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions, including Biogen, Genentech, Cytokinetics, Genentech and Mallinckrodt in various stages of clinical trials.
•Lysosomal Storage Diseases: The currently approved treatments for LSDs are enzyme based therapies. Potentially disease modifying therapeutics are being developed by several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ArmaGen, BioMarin, JCR Pharmaceuticals, RegenxBio, Sangamo, Sanofi, Shire, Sangamo, RegenxBio and Ultragenyx in various stages of clinical trials.
In addition, there are companies that are developing technologies that would compete directly with our technologies, including:
•Blood-Brain Barrier Technology: There are several large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies developing BBB delivery technologies that utilize RMT, including AbbVie, biOasis Technologies, ArmaGen, JCR Pharmaceuticals and Roche (including Genentech, its wholly owned subsidiary), among others.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates, novel biological discoveries and BBB platform technology, including new targets and applications, and other inventions that are important to our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of February 28, 2019, our owned and licensed patent portfolio includes over 800 patents and patent applications, including over 30 licensed U.S. issued patents, over 5 licensed U.S. pending patent applications, 7 owned U.S. issued patents, and over 30 owned U.S. pending patent applications, covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology, our product candidates, and related inventions and improvements. The patent portfolio also includes over 535 licensed patents issued in jurisdictions outside of the United States, over 50 licensed patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States, and over 140 owned patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside of the United States that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. patents and patent applications. For our product candidates and our BBB platform technology, we generally pursue or in-license patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of use and manufacture. For example, we own patent applications in the United States and internationally that are directed to the composition of matter of certain antibodies and small molecule product candidates that we intend to develop or are developing, as well as the Fc domain portion of our BBB platform technology.
For our BBB platform technology we own pending patent applications directed to the composition and sequences of our TfR-binding ATVs and an issued U.S. patent and pending patent applications to other BBB platform technology. Furthermore, we own patent applications directed to our ATV:Tau, ATV:aSyn, ATV:TREM2, and ETV:IDS programs. In addition, we license multiple patent families from F-star, the earliest issued patents of which are expected to expire in 2026, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions. For our LRRK2 program, we license multiple patent families from Genentech directed to, among other things, our LRRK2 program, including DNL201, DNL151 and other related compounds, which are expected to expire in 2031, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions; and we own an issued U.S. patent, which is expected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions, and pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside the U.S. directed to the composition of matter of DNL151. For our RIPK1 program, we own three issued U.S. patents, which are expected to expire in 2037, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions and pending patent applications, which are directed to the composition of matter of DNL747 as well as other RIPK1 inhibitor compounds.
We cannot guarantee that our owned and licensed pending patent applications, or any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the scope of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our programs and product candidates. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property."
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act ("PHSA"), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Any future product candidates must be approved by the FDA through either a new drug application ("NDA"), or a biologics license application ("BLA"), process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
•Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice ("GLP"), requirements;
•Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•Approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice ("GCP"), requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
•Submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA;
•A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the filing for review;
•Satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biologic will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMP"), requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States; and
•Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
The data required to support an NDA or BLA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

•Phase I clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
•Phase II clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further PK and PD information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.

•Phase III clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate or severity of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
NDA/BLA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA or BLA is a request for approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug or safety, purity and potency for a biologic. The application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use and/or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2019, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as an NDA or BLA, is $2,588,478. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug or biologic of $309,915. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA or original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process may be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA or BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track or breakthrough therapy designation program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. 
Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
A product may be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality ("IMM"), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval subsequently provide additional data confirming the anticipated clinical benefit, for example by performing adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Abbreviated Licensure Pathway of Biological Products as Biosimilar or Interchangeable
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"), Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The BPCIA attempts to minimize duplicative testing, and thereby lower development costs and increase patient access to affordable treatments. An application for licensure of a biosimilar product must include information demonstrating biosimilarity based upon the following, unless the FDA determines otherwise:
•analytical studies demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the approved product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components;
•animal studies (including the assessment of toxicity); and
•a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and PK or PD) sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more conditions for which the reference product is licensed and intended to be used.
In addition, an application must include information demonstrating that:

•the proposed biosimilar product and reference product utilize the same mechanism of action for the condition(s) of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism(s) of action are known for the reference product;
•the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling for the proposed biosimilar product have been previously approved for the reference product;

•the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the proposed biosimilar product are the same as those for the reference product; and
•the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure that the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
Biosimilarity means that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. In addition, the law provides for a designation of “interchangeability” between the reference and biosimilar products, whereby the biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The higher standard of interchangeability must be demonstrated by information sufficient to show that:
•the proposed product is biosimilar to the reference product;
•the proposed product is expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and
•for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk to the patient in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and the reference product is no greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.
FDA approval is required before a biosimilar may be marketed in the United States. However, complexities associated with the large and intricate structures of biological products and the process by which such products are manufactured pose significant hurdles to the FDA’s implementation of the law that are still being worked out by the FDA. For example, the FDA has discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence—laboratory, preclinical and/or clinical—required to demonstrate biosimilarity to a licensed biological product.
The FDA intends to consider the totality of the evidence, provided by a sponsor to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, and recommends that sponsors use a stepwise approach in the development of their biosimilar products. Biosimilar product applications thus may not be required to duplicate the entirety of preclinical and clinical testing used to establish the underlying safety and effectiveness of the reference product. However, the FDA may refuse to approve a biosimilar application if there is insufficient information to show that the active ingredients are the same or to demonstrate that any impurities or differences in active ingredients do not affect the safety, purity or potency of the biosimilar product. In addition, as with BLAs, biosimilar product applications will not be approved unless the product is manufactured in facilities designed to assure and preserve the biological product’s safety, purity and potency.
The submission of a biosimilar application does not guarantee that the FDA will accept the application for filing and review, as the FDA may refuse to accept applications that it finds are insufficiently complete. The FDA will treat a biosimilar application or supplement as incomplete if, among other reasons, any applicable user fees assessed under the Biosimilar User Fee Act of 2012 have not been paid. In addition, the FDA may accept an application for filing but deny approval on the basis that the sponsor has not demonstrated biosimilarity, in which case the sponsor may choose to conduct further analytical, preclinical or clinical studies and submit a BLA for licensure as a new biological product.
The timing of final FDA approval of a biosimilar for commercial distribution depends on a variety of factors, including whether the manufacturer of the branded product is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which time the FDA is prohibited from approving any products that are biosimilar to the branded product. The FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application for twelve years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. Additionally, a biosimilar product sponsor may not submit an application for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. A reference product may also be entitled to exclusivity under other statutory provisions. For example, a reference product designated for a rare disease or condition (an “orphan drug”) may be entitled to seven years of exclusivity, in which case no product that is biosimilar to the reference product may be approved until either the end of the twelve-year period provided under the biosimilarity statute or the end of the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, whichever occurs later. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block biosimilarity applications from being approved on or after the patent expiration date. In addition, the FDA may under certain circumstances extend the exclusivity period for the reference product by an additional six months if the FDA requests, and the manufacturer undertakes, studies on the effect of its product in children, a so-called pediatric extension.
The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded product for any condition of use is also entitled to a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the reference product for any condition of use. This exclusivity period extends until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued.
Post-Approval Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse experiences, and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
•applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific and educational programs also must comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of biologic and pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
U.S. Patent-Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application ("ANDA"), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A reference biological product is granted twelve years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
European Union Drug Development
As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority ("NCA"), and one or more Ethics Committees ("ECs"). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical. In the meantime, Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC continues to govern all clinical trials performed in the EU.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization ("MA"). There are two types of marketing authorizations. 
•The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"), of the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure may also apply for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
•National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State ("RMS"). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics ("SPC"), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned).
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA assess the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price ("AMP"), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"), have proposed to expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the United States as well.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 ("MMA"), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. 
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
