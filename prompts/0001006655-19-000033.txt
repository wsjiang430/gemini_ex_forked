General
Evolution Petroleum Corporation is an oil and gas company focused on delivering a sustainable dividend yield to its shareholders through the ownership, management and development of producing oil and gas properties. The Company's long-term goal is to build a diversified portfolio of oil and gas assets primarily through acquisition, while seeking opportunities to maintain and increase production through selective development, production enhancement and other exploitation efforts on its properties. 
Our producing assets over the last three fiscal years consisted of our interests in the Delhi Holt-Bryant Unit in the Delhi field (the "Unit") in Northeast Louisiana, a CO2 enhanced oil recovery project, and a de minimis overriding royalty interest retained in a past divestiture. We have a combined net revenue interest in the Unit of 26.2% comprised of 7.2% of overriding royalty interests that are in effect for the life of the Unit and mineral royalty interests and a 23.9% working interest with an associated 19.0% net revenue interest.
Significant Activity in Fiscal 2019

• | Delhi proved oil equivalent reserves at June 30, 2019 were 9.0 MMBOE, a 4% decrease from the previous year. The Standardized Measure for proved reserves increased 7% to $127 million, reflecting a rise in realized commodity price from $54.71 to $58.50 per BOE. Our proved reserves consist of 85% crude oil and 15% natural gas liquids.


• | Delhi probable** reserves at June 30, 2019 were 4.8 MMBOE, a 7% increase over the previous year. 87% of these reserves are incremental reserves associated with existing developed and producing locations. No additional capital investment is required beyond what is captured in proved reserves.


• | Delhi possible** reserves at June 30, 2019 were 4.3 MMBOE, a 7% decrease over the previous year. 91% of these reserves are incremental reserves associated with existing developed and producing locations. No additional capital investment is required beyond what is captured in proved reserves.


• | The twelve well infill program, consisting of ten producer wells and two CO2 injector wells, was completed and on production during fiscal 2019, converting 536 MBOE of proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves.


• | Capital expenditures for the six-well water curtain program and related infrastructure preceding the planned Delhi Phase V development is almost complete. The first pad commenced operations during fiscal 2019 and the second pad is expected to begin injections during our second quarter of fiscal 2020.

Our Reserves: Delhi Field - Enhanced Oil Recovery - Onshore Louisiana
Our independent petroleum engineering firm, DeGolyer & MacNaughton ("D&M"), assigned the estimated reserves net to our interests at Delhi as of June 30, 2019. We had 9.0 million bbls of proved oil equivalent reserves, with a Standardized Measure of $127 million, and PV-10* of $157 million. The following table summarizes the reserves assigned by D&M:

 | Reserves as of June 30, 2019
 | Proved | | Probable** | | Possible**
Reserves MBOE | 8,981 | | | 4,783 | | 4,321 |

______________________________________________________________________________

* | PV-10 of proved reserves is a non-GAAP measure, reconciled to the Standardized Measure at "Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues" below in Item 1. Business in this 10-K. Both the Standardized Measure and PV-10 are based on the average first day of the month net commodity prices received at the Delhi field in the twelve months ending June 30, 2019, which were $64.54 per barrel of oil and $23.83 per barrel of natural gas liquids ("NGL"). Probable and possible reserves are not recognized under GAAP nor is there a comparable GAAP measure for probable and possible reserves. 


** | With respect to the above reserve numbers, and references to probable and possible reserves throughout this document, estimates of probable and possible reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and there must be at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserve estimates. Possible reserves are even less certain and there must be at least a 10% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved, probable and possible reserve estimates. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development, price changes and other factors. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. These three reserve categories have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not meaningfully combined. 

Development History of the Delhi Field - Enhanced Oil Recovery - Onshore Louisiana 
Our working and royalty interests in the Delhi field are currently our primary producing assets. The Unit is approximately 13,636 acres in size and has had a prolific production history totaling approximately 195 million bbls of oil through primary and limited secondary recovery operations since its discovery in the mid-1940s. At the time of our purchase of the field in 2003, the Unit had minimal production. We conveyed our working interest in the field to a subsidiary of Denbury Resources, Inc. in May 2006 for $50 million for the purpose of installing an enhanced oil recovery ("EOR") project in the field. We retained a 23.9% reversionary working interest upon payout of the project, as defined in the purchase and sale agreements. Since EOR production began in March 2010, the Unit has produced over 20 million bbls of oil.
After the May 2006 conveyance, Denbury Resources, Inc., as the operator, originally planned six primary phases for the installation of the CO2 flood in the Delhi field. Four of these phases have been completed as of June 30, 2017 and two remain undeveloped. One of the remaining two phases (Phase V) is reflected as Proved undeveloped in our current reserves report and the other was removed from proved reserves (Phase VI) as it was not deemed economic under current pricing guidelines for SEC purposes.
Phase I began CO2 injection in November 2009. First oil production response occurred in March 2010 and production in the field increased to approximately 1,000 gross barrels of oil per day by December 2010.
2

Implementation of Phase II, which was more than double the size of Phase I, commenced with incremental CO2 injection at the end of December 2010. First oil production response from Phase II occurred during March 2011, and field gross production increased to more than 4,000 barrels of oil per day by June 2011.
Phase III was installed during calendar 2011, and was expanded twice during calendar 2011. Production subsequently increased to more than 5,000 gross barrels of oil per day.
Phase IV was substantially installed during the first six months of calendar 2012. During early calendar 2013, the operator intensified development in the previously redeveloped western side of the field based on production results and new geological mapping that included the results of seismic data acquired over the last few years. Gross field production increased to more than 7,500 gross barrels of oil per day.
In June 2013, following an adverse fluid release event that consisted of the uncontrolled release of CO2, water, natural gas and a small amount of oil from a previously plugged well in the southwest part of the field, the operator suspended CO2 injection in most of the southwestern tip of the field. The operator has fully remediated the affected area, but has isolated that part of the field with a water curtain, thus removing that area from the CO2 flood.
Construction began on the NGL extraction plant in February 2015. During fiscal 2017, the NGL extraction plant was completed and began processing in December 2016. The plant extracts methane and NGL's from the CO2 recycle stream. The methane and part of the ethane produced by the NGL plant are used to generate electrical power for the benefit and use in the field. The extracted NGL's are sold at the field to a purchaser who transports them by truck to a plant for further processing. In addition to the value of these hydrocarbon products, the increased purity of the CO2 stream re-injected into the field has resulted in operational benefits to the CO2 flood. We have incurred a net capital cost of approximately $27 million for the plant, including capital upgrades since its commissioning.
Subsequent to the reversion of our working interest to us in November 2014, the operator initiated work on the Phase V expansion of the CO2 flood in the undeveloped eastern part of the field. These operations were suspended shortly after reversion when the operator made significant cuts in its capital budget as a result of declining oil prices. Resumption of this work has been electively delayed due to prevailing oil prices and the partners' allocation of capital to other Delhi projects, primarily the large investment in the NGL plant together with the consensus that Phase V project economics would be enhanced if it were implemented after completion of the NGL plant.
During fiscal 2019 the twelve well infill program, consisting of ten producing wells and two CO2 injection wells was completed and on production. The program commenced in March 2018 to target productive oil zones in the developed areas of the field that were not being swept effectively by the CO2 flood.
Also during the year, one pad of the six-well water curtain program was completed and commenced water injection during the second half of fiscal 2019. The project began late in fiscal 2017 after completion of the NGL plant with the drilling of one well followed by three wells in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we drilled the two remaining wells and proceeded with completions and injection line work. In fiscal 2020, we expect to incur approximately $0.6 million of net capital expenditures for completing the installation of the second three-well pad planned to begin injection in the second fiscal quarter.
Estimated Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Estimated Future Net Revenues
The SEC sets rules related to reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies. These rules require disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the trailing 12-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, rather than year-end prices, and allows the use of new technologies in the determination of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes. Subject to limited exceptions, the rules also require that proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and estimates of reserves quantities and values must be viewed as being subject to significant change as more data about the properties becomes available.
Estimates of probable and possible reserves are inherently imprecise. When producing an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas liquids that is recoverable from a particular reservoir, probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered, generally described as having a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal of exceed the proved plus probable reserve estimates. Possible reserves are even less certain and generally require only a 10% or greater probability of that actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved, probable and possible reserve estimates. All categories of reserves are continually subject to revisions based on production history, results of additional exploration and development,

price changes and other factors. Estimates of probable and possible reserves are by their nature much more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and are subject to greater uncertainties, and accordingly the likelihood of recovering those reserves is subject to substantially greater risk. These three reserve categories have not been adjusted to different levels of recovery risk among these categories and are therefore not comparable and are not meaningfully combined.
Information About the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows ("Standardized Measure") and pre-tax PV-10 of Proved Reserves
Estimated pre-tax future net revenues from the production of proved reserves discounted at 10%, or PV-10, is a financial measure that is not recognized by GAAP. We believe that the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure of PV-10 provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by analysts and investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies, and that it is relevant and useful for evaluating the relative monetary significance of oil and natural gas properties. Further, analysts and investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies' reserves. We also use this pre-tax measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to oil and natural gas properties and in evaluating acquisition opportunities. Because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid, we believe the use of a pre-tax measure is valuable for evaluating our Company. PV-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor is it intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure as defined under GAAP, and reconciled herein. Refer to the "Reconciliation of PV-10 to the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows" below.
Summary of Oil & Gas Reserves for Fiscal Year Ended 2019
Our proved, probable and possible reserves at June 30, 2019, denominated in equivalent barrels using six MCF of gas and 42 gallons of natural gas liquids to one barrel of oil conversion ratio, were estimated by our independent petroleum engineer, DeGolyer and MacNaughton ("D&M") which was formed in 1936, employs over 180 petroleum engineers, geologists and other technical personnel, and operates domestically and around the world. D&M was selected to estimate reserves for our interests in the Delhi field due to their expertise in CO2-EOR projects and to ensure consistency with the operator of the Delhi field. The scope and results of their procedures are summarized in a letter from the firm, which is included as exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table sets forth our estimated proved, probable and possible reserves as of June 30, 2019. For additional reserve information see Note 20 – Supplemental Disclosures about Oil and Natural Gas Producing Properties (Unaudited) of the consolidated financial statements. The NYMEX previous 12-month unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month price used to calculate estimated revenues was $61.62 per barrel of crude oil. The net price per barrel of natural gas liquids was $23.83, which does not have any single comparable reference index price. The NGL price was based on historical prices received. For periods for which no historical price information was available, we used comparable pricing in the area. Pricing differentials were applied based on quality, processing, transportation, location and other pricing aspects for each individual property and product.

Internal Controls Over Reserves Estimation Process and Qualifications of Technical Persons with Oversight for the Company's Overall Reserve Estimation Process
Our policies regarding internal controls over reserves estimates require such estimates to be prepared by an independent petroleum engineering firm under the supervision of our Chairman of the Board and interim Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Engineering and Business Development, a professional petroleum engineer. Such reserves estimates are to be in compliance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. 
The reserves information in this filing is based on estimates prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, our independent petroleum engineering firm, which was formed in 1936, employs over 180 petroleum engineers, geologists and other technical personnel, and operates domestically and around the world. The person responsible for preparing the reserves report with D&M is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and a Senior Vice President of the firm. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering from the University of Texas in 1984, has over 35 years of experience in the energy industry and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
Our Chairman of the Board and interim Chief Executive Officer holds B.S. and M.E. degrees from Rice University in chemical engineering and earned an M.B.A. from Harvard University. He has over 30 years of experience in engineering, energy transactions, operations and finance with small independents, larger independents and major integrated oil companies. Our Senior Vice President of Engineering and Business Development received a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1979 and has over 39 years of experience in the energy industry with upstream oil and gas companies. On July 10, 2019, Jason Brown was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Herlin remained as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Brown has over 20 years of experience in the energy industry and is a Registered Professional Engineer (Petroleum) in the State of Texas. He earned his B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Tulsa and his M.B.A. from the Mendoza School of Business at the University of Notre Dame.
 We provide our independent petroleum engineering firm with our property interests, production, current operating costs, current production prices and other information. This information is reviewed by our Senior Vice President of Engineering and Business Development and other members of management to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to submission to this firm. The scope and results of our independent petroleum engineering firm's procedures, as well as their professional qualifications, are summarized in the letter included as exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Our Proved undeveloped reserves were 1,583 MBOE at June 30, 2019, with associated future development costs of approximately $8.6 million, which are associated with the Phase V development in the eastern portion of Delhi field.
During the year ended June 30, 2019 our proved undeveloped reserves changed as follows:
 | Oil(MBbls) | | NGLs(MBbls) | | | Total Reserves(MBOE)
June 30, 2018 | 1,798 | | | 284 | | | 2,082 | 
Revisions to previous estimates | 7 | | | 30 | | | 37 | 
Conversion to proved developed reserves | (463 | ) | | (73 | ) | | (536 | )
June 30, 2019 | 1,342 | | | 241 | | | 1,583 | 

Oil and NGL reserves were revised upward 7 MBbls and 29 MBOE, respectively, reflecting improved existing well and NGL plant performance over the last year. The infill program, consisting of ten producer wells and two CO2 injection wells, was completed during 2019 resulting in the conversion of 463 MBbls of oil and and 73 MBOE of NGLs from Proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Since the project's inception in March 2018, our infill project net capital expenditures have totaled $4.6 million, of which $1.8 million was incurred during fiscal 2019.
The initial assignment of proved undeveloped reserves in the Delhi field was made on June 30, 2010, which encompassed a large scale CO2 enhanced oil recovery project. The operator’s development plans for the field were to have remained essentially unchanged and were originally scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2015, within five years from the initial recording of such proved reserves. Developed reserves are approximately 82% of total Proved reserves as of June 30, 2019. However, as a result of the adverse fluid release event in the field in June 2013 and the resulting delay in reversion of our working interest, development of the field has not proceeded as originally scheduled. Expansion of the CO2 flood to the remaining undeveloped eastern portion of the field commenced subsequent to reversion of our working interest in late 
7

calendar 2014. We incurred $3.8 million of capital expenditures before the operator electively deferred this project as a result of a reduction in its cash flows and capital spending from the significant drop in oil prices. This project was further electively deferred as we began work on the NGL recovery plant field in February 2015. It was determined that the economics of development of the remaining eastern portion of the field would be significantly improved after the NGL plant was completed.
During fiscal 2015, we authorized the NGL plant project and from late in that fiscal year until January 2017 when production of NGLs began, we incurred $26.0 million of related capital expenditures. The NGL plant was completed in December 2016 and we converted approximately 1,377 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during fiscal 2017.
Since completion of the plant, we have resumed work that had been suspended in late 2014 and further deferred until the NGL recovery plant was complete. Cumulatively, we have spent $3.1 million as of June 30, 2019, including $1.6 million in fiscal 2019, on the six well water curtain program and related infrastructure required to precede the development of Phase V. As of June 30, 2019 we had drilled all the wells, including four gross wells during fiscal 2019, and commenced operations for one of the program's pads. The program was configured as two pads with each having two injector wells and one water source well. The second pad is expected to begin operations in the second fiscal quarter of 2020 and we expect to incur approximately $0.6 million net of capital expenditures to complete the program. 
As of June 30, 2019, we have estimated total future net capital expenditures of approximately $8.6 million for remaining curtain infrastructure and development of Phase V in the eastern part of the field, which we expect to commence in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020 based on our discussions with the operator. The timing of Phase V is dependent on the field operator's available funds and capital spending plans and priorities within its portfolio of properties. 
 We believe this project is economic in the current oil price environment and we expect it to be completed within the next two fiscal years. We have been continuously developing the Delhi field and have spent over $47 million subsequent to reversion of our working interest in November 2014. Given the long-term nature of CO2 EOR development projects, we believe that the remaining undeveloped reserves in the Delhi field satisfy the conditions to continue to be treated as proved undeveloped reserves because (1) we initially established the development plan for the Delhi field in 2010 and continue to follow that plan, as adjusted to incorporate the completion of the NGL plant in late 2016 and delays relating to the 2013 adverse fluid release event; (2) we have had significant ongoing development activities at this project that, as budgeted and currently being expended, reflect a significant and sufficient portion of remaining capital expenditures to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves; and (3) the operator has a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.
As of June 30, 2019, no proved, probable or possible reserves were attributed to (a) the area beneath the inhabited portion of the town of Delhi in the northeast and (b) the farthest east of the two remaining undeveloped sites in the eastern portion of the field (Phase VI) due to the current economics and other technical aspects of our future development plans. In addition, no probable reserves are currently attributed to three smaller reservoirs within the Unit in similar formations with similar production history due to the lower oil price utilized in our reserves calculation. We also do not have proved or probable reserves associated with out interests in the Mengel Sand, a separate interval within the Unit that is not currently producing, but has produced oil in the past.

* BOE computed on units of production using a six to one conversion ratio of MCF's to barrels.
Drilling Activity 
Our productive drilling activity during the past three fiscal years ended June 30, 2019, was limited to five gross (1.2 net) producer wells drilled and completed in fiscal 2019 and another five (1.2 net) producer wells completed in fiscal 2018. We completed one (0.239 net) CO2 injection well during fiscal 2019 and completed one (0.239 net) CO2 injection well during fiscal 2018. There were no completions of productive wells in fiscal 2017. No dry wells were drilled in the past three fiscal years. 
In connection with establishing a six-well water curtain in advance of Phase V site development, during fiscal 2019 we drilled two (0.48 net) wells and completed three (0.72 net) wells. In fiscal 2018, we had drilled three (0.72 net) wells and in fiscal 2017 one (0.239 net) well was drilled. The three completed wells comprise the northern pad of the water curtain program and commenced injection during fiscal 2019. A pad consists of one gross water source well and two gross water injector wells.
Present Activities
As of June 30, 2019, we have three gross (0.72 net) water curtain wells remaining to be completed. We expect their completions will conclude and the wells to be online by early in our second quarter of fiscal 2020. These wells comprise the southern pad of the curtain program. 
For further discussion, see "Highlights for our fiscal year 2019" and "Capital Budget" under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
Delivery Commitments
As of June 30, 2019, we were not committed to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil, NGLs or gas under existing agreements, nor do we currently intend to enter into any such agreements.

Acreage Data
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our developed and undeveloped lease acreage as of June 30, 2019. Developed acreage refers to acreage on which wells have been drilled or completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities. Undeveloped acreage refers to acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit production of oil and gas in commercial quantities whether or not the acreage contains proved reserves. 

Field | Developed Acreage | Undeveloped Acreage | | Total
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net
Delhi Field, Louisiana* | 9,126 | | 2,180 | | 4,510 | | 1,077 | | 13,636 | 3,257

________________
* This table excludes acreage attributable to small overriding royalty interests retained in various formations in the Giddings Field area. Except for de minimis production that began on two leases during fiscal 2019, none of such acreage is currently producing and our interests are subject to expiration if leases are not maintained by others or commercial production is not established. It does not currently appear likely that we will obtain any significant value from these interests and no reserves have been assigned to any of the Giddings interests.
When the Company acquired the Delhi field in 2003, the field had been fully developed through primary and secondary recovery and all of such acreage was reflected as developed acreage. With the addition of a CO2-EOR project in the field, certain acreage is now reflected as undeveloped using tertiary recovery operations. We estimate that our developed acreage currently includes 9,126 gross (2,180 net) acres in the Delhi field, with approximately 4,510 gross (1,077 net) acres attributable to the remaining undeveloped areas in the eastern part of the field. We own a 23.9% working interest in the field, along with certain mineral and royalty interests. We are not the operator of the EOR project.
Our interests include all depths from the surface of the earth to the top of the Massive Anhydride, including the Delhi Holt Bryant Unit, which is currently under CO2 flood, and the Mengel Sand Interval, which is within the boundary of the field, but is currently not producing. As the Delhi field is unitized, all acreage, including any undeveloped, nonproductive or undrilled acreage is held by existing production as long as continuous production is maintained in the unit.
For more complete information regarding current year activities, including crude oil and natural gas production, refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.
Markets and Customers 
Our production is marketed to third parties in a manner consistent with industry practices. In the U.S. market where we operate, crude oil and natural gas liquids are readily transportable and marketable. We do not currently market our share of crude oil production from Delhi separately from the operator's share of production. Although we have the right to take our working interest production in-kind, we are currently selling our oil under the Delhi operator's agreement with Plains Marketing L.P. pursuant to the delivery and pricing terms thereunder. The oil from Delhi is currently transported from the field by pipeline, which results in better net pricing than the alternative of transportation by truck. Delhi crude oil production sells at Louisiana Light Sweet ("LLS") pricing which generally trades at a premium to West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil pricing. The positive LLS Gulf Coast average price differential over WTI, as quoted daily on the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), was approximately $6.89 per barrel during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. The differential has increased from the prior year and we expect that a positive LLS price differential will continue, at least in the near future. Our overall average net realized oil price, including the LLS premium and after all adjustments for transportation, marketing and other price differentials, was $4.11 per barrel more than the average WTI NYMEX price for fiscal 2019.

Upon completion of the NGL plant in December 2016, we began selling natural gas liquids from the Delhi field to American Midstream Gas Solutions, L.P. Title to these products is transferred to the purchaser at the field and they are transported by truck to the purchaser's processing facility. We receive market prices, less transportation, processing and quality differential fees for the net yield of the individual natural gas liquid components, consisting of propane, butanes, and C5+ (pentanes and heavier components). There is a small component of residual ethane, but the overall yield of products is a higher value mix than is typical for natural gas liquids.
The following table sets forth purchasers of our oil and natural gas production for the years indicated:

 | Year Ended June 30,
Customer | 2019 | | 2018
Plains Marketing L.P. (Oil sales from Delhi) | 94 | % | | 92 | %
American Midstream Gas Solutions. L.P. (NGL sales from Delhi) | 6 | % | | 8 | %
All others | — | % | | — | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | %

The loss of a purchaser at the Delhi field or disruption to pipeline transportation from the field could adversely affect our net realized pricing and potentially our near-term production levels. The loss of any of our other purchasers would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Market Conditions
Marketing of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids and the prices we receive are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control, the exact effect of which is difficult to predict. These factors include changes in supply and demand, market prices, government regulation and actions of major foreign producers.
Over the past 30 years, crude oil price fluctuations have been extremely volatile, with crude oil prices varying from less than $10 to over $140 per barrel. More recently, the price of oil per barrel dropped dramatically, starting in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing into 2017 before recovering somewhat in late calendar 2018 and then weakening again in 2019. Worldwide factors such as geopolitical, international trade disruptions and tariffs, macroeconomic, supply and demand, refining capacity, petrochemical production and derivatives trading, among others, influence prices for crude oil. Local factors also influence prices for crude oil and include increasing or decreasing production trends, quality differences, regulation and transportation issues unique to certain producing regions and reservoirs.
Also over the past 30 years, domestic natural gas prices have been extremely volatile, ranging from $1 to $15 per MMBTU. The spot market for natural gas, changes in supply and demand, derivatives trading, pipeline availability, BTU content of the natural gas and weather patterns, among others, cause natural gas prices to be subject to significant fluctuations. Due to the practical difficulties in transporting natural gas, local and regional factors tend to influence product prices more for natural gas than for crude oil.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive for prospects, acreage and capital. Our competitors include major integrated crude oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent crude oil and natural gas companies, individuals and drilling and income programs. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours. Competitors are national, regional or local in scope and compete on the basis of financial resources, technical prowess or local knowledge. The principal competitive factors in our industry are expertise in given geographical and geological areas and the abilities to efficiently conduct operations, achieve technological advantages, identify, acquire economically producible reserves and obtain capital at rates which allow economic investments.
Government Regulation
Numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry, including environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are often changed in response to changes in the political or economic environment. Compliance with this evolving regulatory burden is often difficult and costly, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations and we believe that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us. The future annual capital cost of complying with the regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements which are unpredictable. However, we do not currently anticipate that future compliance with existing laws and regulations will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

See "Government regulation and liability for environmental matters that may adversely affect our business and results of operations" under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, for additional information regarding government regulation.
Insurance
We maintain insurance on our oil and gas properties and operations for risks and in amounts customary in the industry. Such insurance includes general liability, excess liability, control of well, operators extra expense, casualty, fraud and directors & officer's liability coverage. Not all losses are insured, and we retain certain risks of loss through deductibles, limits and self-retentions. We do not carry lost profits coverage and we do not have coverage for consequential damages.
Employment 
At June 30, 2019, we had four full-time employees, not including contract personnel and outsourced service providers. None of the Company’s employees are currently represented by a union, and the Company believes that it has excellent relations with its employees. Our team is broadly experienced in oil and gas operations, development, acquisitions and financing. We follow a strategy of outsourcing most of our property accounting, human resources, administrative and other non-core functions. As a result of the retirement of Randy Keys, President and Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2018, the Board of Directors named Robert Herlin to act as Interim Chief Executive Officer and to commence a search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer. A special Transition Services Committee of the board was created with one member, William Dozier, to provide additional operational oversight to the Company during the transition to a new Chief Executive Officer. On July 10, 2019, Mr. Jason Brown was appointed by the Board of Directors to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Robert Herlin, remained as Chairman of the Board.
