Industry and Competition
Trucking in the U.S., according to the American Trucking Association (“ATA”), was estimated to be a $700 billion industry in 2017, representing approximately 79% of the total U.S. transportation industry revenue. Furthermore, ATA estimates that approximately 70% of all freight tonnage in 2017 was carried by trucks. Trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported. To meet this continued high demand for freight, truck carriers will need to replace and expand their fleets, which typically results in increased trailer orders.
Transportation in the U.S., including trucking, is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last 20 years. In each of the last three cycles the decline in freight tonnage preceded the general U.S. economic downturn by approximately two and one-half years and the recovery has generally preceded that of the economy as a whole. The trailer industry generally follows the transportation industry, experiencing cycles in the early and late 90’s lasting approximately 58 and 67 months, respectively. Truck freight tonnage, according to ATA statistics, started declining year-over-year in 2006 and remained at depressed levels through 2009. The most recent cycle concluded in 2009, lasting a total of 89 months. After three consecutive years with total trailer demand well below normal replacement demand levels estimated to be approximately 220,000 trailers, the period ending December 31, 2018 demonstrated five consecutive years of healthy demand in which there were total trailer shipments of approximately 269,000, 308,000, 286,000, 288,000, and 323,000 for the years ending 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In our view, we expect to see continued strong demand for new trailer equipment as the economic and industry specific indicators we track, including ATA’s truck tonnage index, carrier/fleet profitability, employment growth, housing and auto sectors, as well as the overall gross domestic product, continue to be positive indicators.
Wabash, Great Dane, Utility and Hyundai Translead are generally viewed as the top manufacturers in U.S. trailer shipments by volume. Our share of U.S. total trailer shipments in 2018 was approximately 19%. Trailer manufacturers compete primarily through the quality of their products, customer relationships, innovative technology, and price. We have seen others in the industry also pursue the development and use of composite sidewalls that compete directly with our DuraPlate® products. Our product development is focused on maintaining a leading position with respect to these products and on development of new products and markets, leveraging our proprietary DuraPlate® product, as well as our expertise in the engineering and design of customized products.
The table below sets forth new trailers shipped for Wabash and, as provided by Trailer Body Builders Magazine, the principal producers within North America. The data represents all segments of the industry, except containers and chassis. For the years included below, we have participated primarily in the van, platform, and tank trailer segments. 

 | 2018 | 2017 | | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 | 
Wabash | 60,150 | | 54,000 | | 60,000 | | 63,000 | 56,000 | 
Hyundai Translead | 59,000 | | 58,000 | | 49,000 | | 43,000 | 36,000 | 
Great Dane | 49,000 | | 46,000 | | 48,000 | | 52,000 | 48,000 |

Our Diversified Products segment, in most cases, participates in markets different than our traditional van and platform trailer product offerings. The end markets that our Diversified Products segment serve are broader and more diverse than the trailer industry, including environmental, pharmaceutical, biotech, oil and gas, and specialty vehicle markets. In addition, our diversification efforts pertain to new and emerging markets and many of the products are driven by regulatory requirements or, in most cases, customer-specific needs. However, some of our diversification efforts are considered to be in the early growth stages and future success is largely dependent on continued customer adoption of our product solutions and general expansion of our customer base and distribution channels.
Our Final Mile Products segment competes in the specialized vehicle industry, which is highly competitive with only a few national competitors and many smaller, regional companies. As a result of this broad competition, we are often faced with competitive pricing pressures. Other competitive factors include quality of product, lead times, geographic proximity to customers, and the ability to manufacture a product customized to customer specifications. With our national presence and diverse product offerings, we believe that we are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges presented.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our core competitive strengths include:

▪ | Long-Term Core Customer Relationships – We are the leading provider of trailers to a significant number of top tier trucking companies, generating a revenue base that has helped to sustain us as one of the market leaders. Our van products are preferred by many of the industry’s leading carriers. We are also a leading provider of liquid-transportation systems and engineered products and we have a strong customer base, consisting of mostly private fleets, and have earned a leading market position across many of the markets we serve. In addition, we are a leading manufacturer of truck bodies, and we have a strong customer base of large national fleet leasing companies.


▪ | Technology and Innovation – We continue to be recognized by the trucking industry as a leader in developing technology to provide value-added solutions for our customers that reduce trailer operating costs, improve revenue opportunities, and solve unique transportation problems. Throughout our history, we have been and we expect we will continue to be a leading innovator in the design and production of trailers and related products. Recent new trailer introductions and value-added options include the introduction of the Molded Structural Composite (“MSCt”) Refrigerated Van, the commercial launch of the Cold Chain Series Refrigerated Truck Body with molded structural composite technology, both offering advanced thermal and operational performance; Lean Duplex tank trailer, a stainless steel option that reduces weight while providing enhanced performance characteristics over typical chemical tank trailers; Trustlock Plus®, a proprietary single-lock rear door mechanism; and the DuraPlate® AeroSkirt®, Ventix DRS™, AeroFin XL® and AeroSkirt CX™, durable aerodynamic solutions that provide improved fuel efficiencies when used in specific combinations.

Our DuraPlate® proprietary technology offers what we believe to be a superior trailer, which customers value. A DuraPlate® trailer is a composite plate trailer using material that contains a high-density polyethylene core bonded between high-strength steel skins. We believe that the competitive advantages of our DuraPlate® trailers compared to standard trailers include providing a lower total cost of ownership through the following: 

▪ | Extended Service Life – operate three to five years longer;


▪ | Lower Operating and Maintenance Costs – greater durability and performance;


▪ | Less Downtime – higher utilization for fleets;


▪ | Extended Warranty – warranty period for DuraPlate® panels is ten years; and


▪ | Improved Resale Value – higher trade-in and resale values.

We have been manufacturing DuraPlate® trailers for over 23 years and through December 2018 have sold approximately 750,000 DuraPlate® trailers. We believe that this proven experience, combined with ownership and knowledge of the DuraPlate® panel technology, will help ensure continued industry leadership in the future. 
We have also focused on a customer-centered approach in developing product enhancements for other industries we serve. Some of the more recent innovations include: the introduction of a prototype Side Impact Guard (SIG) designed to prevent passenger car under ride in side collisions, introduction of advanced materials to remove significant weight from the standard Dry Van; introduction of RIG-16 offset rear under ride guard, and the introduction of the Truck Body line leveraging our fleet-proven DuraPlate® technology for dry truck bodies as well as the introduction of a revolutionary proprietary composite designed to improve weight and thermal efficiency in refrigerated truck body applications. We also recently introduced DuraPlate® Cell Core, a modified DuraPlate® panel that will reduce the weight of a conventional 53 foot DuraPlate® trailer significantly. This will allow us to continue providing unrivaled value to our customers and differentiate Wabash from our competitors.

Our tank trailers are distributed through a network of 52 independent dealers with 53 locations throughout North America. Additionally, our truck body dealer network consists of more than 1,000 commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets.

Regulation
Truck trailer length, height, width, maximum weight capacity and other specifications are regulated by individual states. The federal government also regulates certain safety and environmental sustainability features incorporated in the design and use of truck and tank trailers, as well as truck bodies. These regulations include: requirements to install Electronic Logging Devices, the use of aerodynamic devices and fuel saving technologies, as well as operator restrictions as to hours of service and minimum driver safety standards (see the section on “Industry Trends” in Item 7 for more details on these regulations). In addition, most tank trailers we manufacture have specific federal regulations and restrictions that dictate tank design, material type and thickness. Manufacturing operations are subject to environmental laws enforced by federal, state and local agencies (see “Environmental Matters”).
Products
Since our inception, we have expanded our product offerings from a single truck trailer dry van product to a broad range of transportation equipment and diversified industrial products. We manage a diverse product portfolio, maintain long-standing customer relationships, and focuses on innovative and breakthrough technologies within three operating segments.

Marketing and Distribution
We market and distribute our products through the following channels:

▪ | Factory direct accounts; and


▪ | Independent dealerships.

10

Factory direct accounts are generally large fleets that are high volume purchasers. Historically, we have focused on the factory direct market in which customers are highly knowledgeable of the life-cycle costs of equipment and, therefore, are best equipped to appreciate the innovative design and value-added features of our products, as well as the value proposition for lower total cost of ownership over the life-cycle of our products.
We also sell our van, platform, and tank trailers through a network of independent dealers. Additionally, our truck body products are sold through commercial dealers. Our dealers primarily serve mid-market and smaller sized carriers and private fleets in the geographic region where the dealer is located and occasionally may sell to large fleets. The dealers may also perform service and warranty work for our customers.
Raw Materials
We utilize a variety of raw materials and components including specialty steel coil, stainless steel, plastic, aluminum, lumber, tires, landing gear, axles and suspensions, which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. Raw material costs, as a percentage of net sales, throughout 2018 were higher compared to prior years. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in raw materials or finished components have had, and could have further, adverse effects on our results of operations. In 2019 and for the foreseeable future, we expect that the raw materials used in the greatest quantity will be steel, aluminum, plastic and wood. We will endeavor to pass along raw material and component cost increases. Price increases used to offset inflation or disruption of supply in core materials have generally been successful, although sometimes are delayed. Increases in prices for these purposes represent a risk in execution. In an effort to minimize the effect of price fluctuations, we only hedge certain commodities that have the potential to significantly impact our results of operations.
Backlog
Orders that have been confirmed by customers in writing, have defined delivery timeframes and can be produced during the next 18 months are included in our backlog. Orders that comprise our backlog may be subject to changes in quantities, delivery, specifications, terms or cancellation. Our backlog of orders at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $1,788 million and $1,213 million, respectively. We expect to complete the majority of our backlog orders as of December 31, 2018 within the next 12 months.
Patents and Intellectual Property
We hold or have applied for 144 patents in the U.S. on various components and techniques utilized in our manufacture of transportation equipment and engineered products. In addition, we hold or have applied for 201 patents in foreign countries.
Our patents include intellectual property related to the manufacture of trailers, containers, and aerodynamic-related products using our proprietary DuraPlate® product as well as other lightweight panel products, truck body, trailer, and aerodynamic-related products utilizing other composite materials, our containment and isolation systems, and other engineered products – all of which we believe offer us a significant competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete.
Our DuraPlate® patent portfolio includes several patents and pending patent applications, which cover not only utilization of our DuraPlate® product in the manufacture of trailers, but also cover a number of aerodynamic-related products aimed at increasing the fuel efficiency of trailers. U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications in our DuraPlate® patent portfolio have expiration dates extending until 2036. Certain U.S. patents relating to the combined use of DuraPlate® panels and logistics systems within the sidewalls of our dry van trailers will not expire until 2027 or after; several other issued U.S. patents and pending patent applications relating to the use of DuraPlate® panels, or other composite materials, within aerodynamic-related products as well as modular storage and shipping containers will not begin to expire until after 2030. Additionally, we also believe that our proprietary DuraPlate® production process, which has been developed and refined since 1995, offers us a significant competitive advantage in the industry – above and beyond the benefits provided by any patent protection concerning the use and/or design of our DuraPlate® products. We believe the proprietary knowledge of this process and the significant intellectual and capital hurdles in creating a similar production process provide us with an advantage over others in the industry who utilize composite sandwich panel technology.
Our intellectual property portfolio further includes a number of patent applications related to the manufacture of truck bodies and trailers using our high-performance MSC Technology™ polymer composite component parts. These patent applications cover the polymer composite component structure and method of manufacturing the same. We believe the intellectual property related to this emerging use of polymer composite technology in our industry, including proprietary knowledge of the processes involved in manufacturing these components and the resulting products, will offer us a significant market advantage to continue to create proprietary products exploiting this technology. These patent applications will not begin to expire until 2036. Additionally, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications related to the rear impact guard (“RIG”) and to a side impact guard (“SIG”) of a trailer. The RIG patents and patent applications include new RIG designs which surpass the current and proposed federal regulatory RIG standards for the U.S. and Canada while the SIG patent applications include new and innovative designs for effectively protecting against side underride.

In addition, our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering many of our engineered products, including our containment and isolation systems, as well as many trailer industry components. These products have become highly desirable and are recognized for their innovation in the markets we serve. The engineered products patents and patent applications relate to our industry leading isolation systems, sold under the Extract Technologies® brand name. These patents will not begin to expire until 2021. The patents and patent applications relating to our proprietary trailer-industry componentry include, for example, those covering the Trust Lock Plus® door locking mechanism, the Max Clearance® Overhead Door System, which provides additional overhead clearance when an overhead-style rear door is in the opened position that would be comparable to that of swing-door models, the use of bonded intermediate logistics strips, the bonded D-ring hold-down device, bonded skylights, and the DuraPlate® arched roof. The patents covering these products will not expire before 2029. Further, another patented product sold by the Diversified Products segment includes the ShakerTank® trailer, a vibrating bulk tank trailer used in transporting viscous materials, whose patents will not expire before 2026. We believe all of these proprietary products offer us a competitive market advantage in the industries in which we compete.
We also hold or have applied for 49 trademarks in the U.S. as well as 60 trademarks in foreign countries. These trademarks include the Wabash®, Wabash National®, Transcraft®, Benson®, Extract Technology®, Beall®, Brenner®, and Supreme® brand names as well as trademarks associated with our proprietary products such as DuraPlate®, RoadRailer®, Transcraft Eagle®, Arctic Lite®, Kold King®, and Iner-City®. Additionally, we utilize several tradenames that are each well-recognized in their industries, including Walker Transport, Walker Stainless Equipment, Walker Engineered Products and Bulk Tank International. Our trademarks associated with additional proprietary products include MSC Technology™, MaxClearance® Overhead Door System, Trust Lock Plus® EZ-7®, DuraPlate Aeroskirt®, Aeroskirt CX®, DuraPlate XD-35®, DuraPlate HD®, SolarGuard®, VentixDRS®, AeroFin XL® and EZ-Adjust®. We believe these trademarks are important for the identification of our products and the associated customer goodwill; however, our business is not materially dependent on such trademarks.
Environmental Matters
Our facilities are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and occupational safety and health. Our operations and facilities have been, and in the future may become, the subject of enforcement actions or proceedings for non-compliance with such laws or for remediation of company-related releases of substances into the environment. Resolution of such matters with regulators can result in commitments to compliance abatement or remediation programs and, in some cases, the payment of penalties (see “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 for more details).
We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Our facilities have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. However, we currently do not anticipate that the future costs of environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had approximately 7,100 and 6,500 full-time employees, respectively. Throughout 2018, essentially all of our active employees were non-union. Our temporary employees represented approximately 11% of our overall production workforce as of December 31, 2018 as compared to approximately 10% at the end of the prior year period.
