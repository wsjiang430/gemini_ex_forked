ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
The Company
EastGroup Properties, Inc., which we refer to in this Annual Report as the "Company" or "EastGroup," is an internally-managed equity real estate investment trust ("REIT") first organized in 1969. EastGroup is focused on the development, acquisition and operation of industrial properties in major Sunbelt markets throughout the United States, primarily in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina. EastGroup’s strategy for growth is based on ownership of premier distribution facilities generally clustered near major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets. EastGroup is a Maryland corporation, and its common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “EGP.”  The Company has elected to be taxed and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Available Information
The Company maintains a website at www.eastgroup.net.  The Company posts its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  In addition, the Company's website includes items related to corporate governance matters, including, among other things, the Company's corporate governance guidelines, charters of various committees of the Board of Directors, and the Company's code of business conduct and ethics applicable to all employees, officers and directors.

Any shareholder also may obtain copies of these documents, free of charge, by sending a request in writing to: Investor Relations, EastGroup Properties, Inc., 400 W. Parkway Place, Suite 100, Ridgeland, MS 39157.
The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. 
Administration
EastGroup maintains its principal executive office and headquarters in Ridgeland, Mississippi.  The Company also has regional offices in Atlanta, Dallas and Los Angeles and asset management offices in Orlando, Charlotte, Houston and Phoenix.  EastGroup has property management offices in Jacksonville, Tampa, Ft. Lauderdale and San Antonio.  Offices at these locations allow the Company to provide property management services to all of its Florida, Texas (except Austin and El Paso), Arizona and North Carolina properties, which together account for 77% of the Company’s total portfolio on a square foot basis.  In addition, the Company currently provides property administration (accounting of operations) for its entire portfolio.  The regional offices in Georgia, Texas and California provide oversight of the Company's development program.  As of February 13, 2019, EastGroup had 72 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees.
Business Overview
EastGroup's goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional, flexible and quality business distribution space for location sensitive customers (primarily in the 15,000 to 50,000 square foot range).  The Company develops, acquires and operates distribution facilities, the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply-constrained submarkets in major Sunbelt regions. The Company's core markets are in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  
As of December 31, 2018, EastGroup owned 377 industrial properties and one office building in 10 states. As of that same date, the Company's portfolio, including development projects and value-add properties in lease-up and under construction, included approximately 41.5 million square feet consisting of 335 business distribution buildings containing 36.4 million square feet, 14 bulk distribution buildings containing 3.7 million square feet, and 28 business service buildings containing 1.4 million square feet. As of December 31, 2018, EastGroup's operating portfolio was 97.3% leased to approximately 1,500 tenants, with no single tenant accounting for more than approximately 1.1% of the Company's income from real estate operations. As of February 13, 2019, the properties development and value-add program at year-end were approximately 45% leased. 
During 2018, EastGroup increased its holdings in real estate properties through its acquisition and development programs.  The Company purchased 627,000 square feet of operating and value-add properties and 83 acres of land for a total of $87 million.  Also during 2018, the Company began construction of 12 development projects containing 1.7 million square feet and transferred 14
5

projects, which contain 1.7 million square feet and had costs of $135.0 million at the date of transfer, from its development and value-add program to real estate properties. 
During 2018, EastGroup completed dispositions including 339,000 square feet of operating properties and 11 acres of land, which generated gross proceeds of $25.4 million. 
Typically, the Company initially funds its development and acquisition programs through its unsecured bank credit facilities. In June 2018, the Company expanded the borrowing capacity under its credit facilities from $335 million to $395 million. As market conditions permit, EastGroup also issues equity or employs fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps, to replace short-term bank borrowings. In June 2018, Moody's Investors Service affirmed the Company's issuer rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. For future debt issuances, the Company intends to issue primarily unsecured fixed-rate debt, including variable-rate debt that has been swapped to an effectively fixed rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The Company may also access the public debt market in the future as a means to raise capital.
EastGroup holds its properties as long-term investments but may determine to sell certain properties that no longer meet its investment criteria.  The Company may provide financing to a prospective purchaser in connection with such sales of property if market conditions require.  In addition, the Company may provide financing to a partner or co-owner in connection with an acquisition of real estate in certain situations.
Subject to the requirements necessary to maintain EastGroup’s qualifications as a REIT, the Company may acquire securities of entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over those entities.
The Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code.  To maintain its status as a REIT, the Company is required to, among other things, distribute at least 90% of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders.  If the Company has a capital gain, it has the option of (i) deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax-deferred exchange, (ii) declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax, or (iii) retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long-term capital gain, with shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long-term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the Company.

EastGroup has no present intention of acting as an underwriter of offerings of securities of other issuers.  The strategies and policies set forth above were determined and are subject to review by EastGroup's Board of Directors, which may change such strategies or policies based upon its evaluation of the state of the real estate market, the performance of EastGroup's assets, capital and credit market conditions, and other relevant factors.  EastGroup provides annual reports to its stockholders, which contain financial statements audited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.
Competition 
The market for the leasing of industrial real estate is competitive. We experience competition for tenants from other existing assets in proximity to our buildings as well as from new development. Institutional investors, other REITs and local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. Even so, as a result of competition, we may have to provide concessions, incur charges for tenant improvements or offer other inducements, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. The market for the acquisition of industrial real estate is also competitive. We compete for real property investments with other REITs and institutional investors such as pension funds and their advisors, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. 
Environmental Property Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property.  Many such laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knows of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.  The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such property or to use such property as collateral in its borrowings.  EastGroup’s properties have been subjected to Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) by independent environmental consultants and, as necessary, have been subjected to Phase II ESAs.  These reports have not revealed any potential significant environmental liability.  Management of EastGroup is not aware of any environmental liability that would have a material adverse effect on EastGroup’s business, assets, financial position or results of operations. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report for additional information.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters
At EastGroup, protecting the environment is important to the Company's employees, families, customers and communities.  The Company strives to support sustainability through its commitment to build high performance and environmentally responsible properties.  Through EastGroup’s continued efforts, numerous properties have been Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and ENERGY STAR certified with the remainder reflecting the Company’s commitment to pursue environmentally conscious performance and standards.  The Company's continued commitment to sustainability best practices creates long-term value for the environment, the Company and shareholders.
EastGroup and its employees are committed to social responsibility and participate in various charitable service organizations in the Company's business communities.  EastGroup's employees volunteer for numerous charities, and the Company coordinates volunteer opportunities for its employees and allows time away from work in order to encourage participation and increase social engagement in all of the communities in which we operate.
SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
This summary updates and supersedes the discussion contained under the caption “Material United States Federal Income Tax Considerations” in (i) the prospectus within our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on March 6, 2017 (the “Prospectus”) and (ii) the prospectus supplement that supplements the Prospectus filed with the SEC on February 15, 2018, and should be read in conjunction therewith and is subject to qualifications set forth therein.
The following summary addresses U.S. federal income tax considerations related to our election to be subject to taxation as a REIT and the ownership and disposition of our common stock or preferred stock that we anticipate being material to holders of such securities. Except to the limited extent discussed below, this summary does not address any foreign, state, or local tax consequences of holding our common stock, or preferred stock. The provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) concerning the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a REIT and its shareholders and security holders are highly technical and complex; the following discussion sets forth only certain aspects of those provisions. This summary is intended to provide you with general information only, it is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning, and it is not tax advice. 
This summary is based on provisions of the Code, applicable final and temporary Treasury Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative rulings and practice, all in effect as of the date of this prospectus, and should not be construed as legal or tax advice. No assurance can be given that future legislative or administrative changes or judicial decisions will not affect the accuracy of the descriptions or conclusions contained in this summary. In addition, any such changes may be retroactive and apply to transactions entered into prior to the date of their enactment, promulgation or release. We do not expect to seek a ruling from the IRS regarding any of the U.S. federal income tax issues discussed in this prospectus, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge any of the positions we take and that such a challenge will not succeed. This discussion does not purport to address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment circumstances, or if you are a type of investor subject to special tax rules. This discussion also does not consider tax considerations that may be relevant with respect to securities we may issue, or selling security holders may sell, other than our common stock and preferred stock described below. Each time we or selling security holders sell securities, we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of that sale and may add to or update the discussion below as appropriate. 
PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF OUR SECURITIES ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS PRIOR TO ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR PREFERRED STOCK CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE INVESTMENT WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO THEIR OWN TAX SITUATIONS. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS ALSO ARE URGED TO REFER TO THE APPLICABLE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THIS SUMMARY.
Except as otherwise noted, references in this discussion of “Supplemental Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” to “we,” “our,” “us” and “our company” refer to EastGroup Properties, Inc. 
Taxation of our Company 
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. We believe that we have been organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended November 30, 1969 and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

In connection with the filing of this prospectus, our tax counsel, Goodwin Procter LLP, is rendering an opinion to us to the effect that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014, we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code and our prior, current and proposed ownership, organization and method of operations have allowed and will continue to allow us to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and for subsequent taxable years. The opinion of Goodwin Procter LLP is based upon various assumptions and our representations as to our past and contemplated future ownership, investments, distributions, share valuations and operations, among other things. The opinion of Goodwin Procter LLP is expressly conditioned upon the accuracy of these and other assumptions and upon our representations, which Goodwin Procter LLP has not verified and will not verify. Moreover, our qualification and taxation as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, distribution levels, and diversity of stock ownership, the various and complex REIT qualification tests imposed under the Code, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed or verified by Goodwin Procter LLP. See “-Qualification as a REIT” below. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. The opinion of Goodwin Procter LLP is based upon the law in effect as of the date of the opinion (or, with respect to past years, the law in effect for such years), which is subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Opinions of counsel impose no obligation on counsel to advise us or the holders of our stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated, represented or assumed, or of any subsequent change in the applicable law. Changes in applicable law could modify the conclusions expressed in the opinion. Unlike a ruling from the IRS, an opinion of Goodwin Procter LLP is not binding on the IRS and no assurance can be given that the IRS could not successfully challenge our qualification as a REIT. 
If we qualify as a REIT, we generally will be allowed to deduct dividends paid to our shareholders, and, as a result, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our ordinary income and net capital gain that we currently distribute to our shareholders. We intend to make distributions to our shareholders on a regular basis as necessary to avoid material U.S. federal income tax and to comply with the REIT requirements. See “—Qualification as a REIT—Annual Distribution Requirements” below. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we nonetheless may be subject to U.S. federal income tax or excise tax in certain circumstances, including the following: 


 | we will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income, including net capital gain;


 | we may be subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on certain income from “foreclosure property” (generally, property acquired by reason of default on a lease or indebtedness held by us);


 | we will be subject to a 100% U.S. federal income tax on net income from “prohibited transactions” (generally, certain sales or other dispositions of property, sometimes referred to as “dealer property,” held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than foreclosure property) unless the gain is realized in a “taxable REIT subsidiary,” or TRS, or such property has been held by us for at least two years and certain other requirements are satisfied;


 | if we fail to satisfy either the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT pursuant to certain relief provisions, we will be subject to a 100% U.S. federal income tax on the greater of (i) the amount by which we fail the 75% gross income test or (ii) the amount by which we fail the 95% gross income test, in either case, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;


 | if we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests, and the failure is not a failure of the 5% or the 10% asset test that qualifies under the De Minimis Exception but the failure does qualify under the General Exception, both as described below under “-Qualification as a REIT-Asset Tests,” then we will have to pay an excise tax equal to the greater of (i) $50,000 and (ii) an amount determined by multiplying the net income generated during a specified period by the assets that caused the failure by the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; 


 | if we fail to satisfy any REIT requirements other than the gross income test or asset test requirements, described below under “-Qualification as a REIT-Income Tests” and “-Qualification as a REIT-Asset Tests,” respectively, and we qualify for a reasonable cause exception, then we will have to pay a penalty equal to $50,000 for each such failure;


 | we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed amounts if certain distribution requirements are not satisfied;

8


 | we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the IRS in certain circumstances, including if we fail to meet record-keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a REIT’s shareholders, as described below in “-Recordkeeping Requirements;”


 | if we dispose of an asset acquired by us from a C corporation in a transaction in which we took the C corporation’s tax basis in the asset, we may be subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on the appreciation inherent in such asset as of the date of acquisition by us;


 | we will be required to pay a 100% tax on any redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, excess interest and redetermined TRS service income. In general, redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished by our TRS. Redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a TRS for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm’s-length negotiations. Redetermined TRS service income generally means the additional gross income a TRS would recognize if it were paid an arm’s length fee for services provided to, or on behalf of, us; and


 | income earned by our TRS or any other subsidiaries that are taxable as C corporations will be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax.

No assurance can be given that the amount of any such U.S. federal income or excise taxes will not be substantial. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes, including payroll taxes and state, local and foreign income, property and other taxes on assets and operations. We could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated. 
Qualification as a REIT 
In General
The REIT provisions of the Code apply to a domestic corporation, trust or association (i) that is managed by one or more trustees or directors, (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest, (iii) that properly elects to be taxed as a REIT and such election has not been terminated or revoked, (iv) that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company, (v) that uses a calendar year for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (vi) that meets the additional requirements discussed below. The discussion below summarizes current law except where expressly noted otherwise. We do not believe any differences between the current requirements for qualification as a REIT and the requirements in effect for any prior year have prevented us from qualifying as a REIT for any period. 
Ownership Tests 
In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, (i) the beneficial ownership of our stock must be held by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year (or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months) for each of our taxable years and (ii) during the last half of each taxable year, no more than 50% in value of our stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals (the “5/50 Test”). Stock ownership for purposes of the 5/50 Test is determined by applying the constructive ownership provisions of Section 544(a) of the Code, subject to certain modifications. The term “individual” for purposes of the 5/50 Test includes a private foundation, a trust providing for the payment of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits, and a portion of a trust permanently set aside or to be used exclusively for charitable purposes. A “qualified trust” described in Section 401(a) of the Code and exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code generally is not treated as an individual; rather, stock held by it is generally treated as owned proportionately by its beneficiaries. 
We believe that we have satisfied and will continue to satisfy the above ownership requirements. In addition, our charter restricts ownership and transfers of our stock that would violate these requirements, although these restrictions may not be effective in all circumstances to prevent a violation. We will be deemed to 
have satisfied the 5/50 Test for a particular taxable year if we have complied with all the requirements for ascertaining the ownership of our outstanding stock in that taxable year and have no reason to know that we have violated the 5/50 Test. 
Income Tests 
In order to maintain qualification as a REIT, we must annually satisfy two gross income requirements: 
(1) First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions and certain other income and gains as described below) for each taxable year must be derived, directly or indirectly, from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investments (or any combination thereof). Qualifying income for purposes of this 75% gross income test generally includes: (a) rents from real property, (b) interest on obligations secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, (c) dividends or other distributions on, and gain from the sale of, shares 
9

in other REITs, (d) gain from the sale of real estate assets (but not including certain debt instruments of publicly offered REITs that are not secured by mortgages on real property or interests on real property and gain from prohibited transactions), (e) income and gain derived from foreclosure property, and (f) income from certain types of temporary investments; and 
(2) Second, in general, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions and certain other income and gains as described below) for each taxable year must be derived from the real property investments described above and from other types of dividends and interest, gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities that are not dealer property, or any combination of the above. 
Rents we receive will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT described above only if several conditions are met. First, the amount of rent generally must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term “rents from real property” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. Second, rents received from a “related party tenant” will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests unless the tenant is a TRS and either (i) at least 90% of the property is leased to unrelated tenants and the rent paid by the TRS is substantially comparable to the rent paid by the unrelated tenants for comparable space, or (ii) the property leased is a “qualified lodging facility,” as defined in Section 856(d)(9)(D) of the Code, or a “qualified health care property,” as defined in Section 856(e)(6)(D)(i), and certain other conditions are satisfied. A tenant is a related party tenant if the REIT, or an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of the REIT, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant. Third, if rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a lease of real property, is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease (determined based on the fair market value as of the beginning and end of the taxable year), then the portion of rent attributable to the personal property will not qualify as rents from real property. 
Generally, for rents to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests, we may provide directly only an insignificant amount of services, unless those services are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant” under the applicable tax rules. Accordingly, we may not provide “impermissible services” to tenants (except through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements or through a TRS) without giving rise to “impermissible tenant service income.” Impermissible tenant service income is deemed to be at least 150% of the direct cost to us of providing the service. If the impermissible tenant service income exceeds 1% of our total income from a property, then all of the income from that property will fail to qualify as rents from real property. If the total amount of impermissible tenant service income from a property does not exceed 1% of our total income from the property, the services will not disqualify any other income from the property that qualifies as rents from real property, but the impermissible tenant service income will not qualify as rents from real property. 
We do not intend to charge significant rent that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, derive significant rents from related party tenants, derive rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with real property that exceeds 15% of the total rents from that property, or derive impermissible tenant service income that exceeds 1% of our total income from any property if the treatment of the rents from such property as nonqualified rents could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT. 
Distributions that we receive from a TRS will be classified as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the TRS. Such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not under the 75% gross income test unless attributable to investments of certain new capital during the one-year period beginning on the date of receipt of the new capital (as described below under “Qualification as a REIT-Income Tests-Qualified temporary investment income”). Any dividends received by us from a REIT will be qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. 
If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or the 95% gross income tests, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for a particular year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. Those relief provisions generally will be available if our failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we file a schedule describing each item of our gross income for such year(s) in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. As discussed above in “-Taxation of Our Company,” even if these relief provisions were to apply, we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax to the extent we fail to meet the 75% or 95% gross income tests. 
Foreclosure property. Foreclosure property is real property (including interests in real property) and any personal property incident to such real property (1) that is acquired by a REIT as a result of the REIT having bid on the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was a default (or default was imminent) on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by the REIT and secured by the property, (2) for which the related loan or lease was made, entered into or acquired by the REIT at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and 
10

(3) for which such REIT makes an election to treat the property as foreclosure property. REITs generally are subject to tax at the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on any net income from foreclosure property, including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the 100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if the property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. 
Hedging transactions. We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate swaps or cap agreements, options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. Except to the extent as may be provided by future Treasury Regulations, any income from a hedging transaction which is (1) clearly identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated or entered into, and (2) accompanied by a substantially contemporaneous identification of the item being hedged, including gain from the disposition or termination of such a transaction, will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests, provided that the hedging transaction is entered into (i) in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to indebtedness incurred or to be incurred by us to acquire or carry real estate assets, (ii) primarily to manage the risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the 75% or 95% gross income tests (or any property which generates such income or gain), or (iii) to hedge against transactions described in clause (i) or (ii) and is entered into in connection with the extinguishment of debt or a sale of property that is being hedged against by the transaction described in clause (i) or (ii). To the extent we enter into other types of hedging transactions or do not make proper identifications, as applicable, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests. We intend to structure, monitor and document our hedging transactions so that such transactions do not jeopardize our ability to qualify as a REIT. No assurances can be given, however, that our hedging activities will not give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of either or both of the gross income tests and that such income will not adversely affect our ability to satisfy REIT qualification requirements. 
Qualified temporary investment income. Income derived from certain types of temporary stock and debt investments made with the proceeds of certain stock and debt offerings (but not including proceeds received pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan), not otherwise treated as qualifying income for the 75% gross income test, generally will nonetheless constitute qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test for the year following such an offering. More specifically, qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test includes “qualified temporary investment income,” which generally means any income that is attributable to stock or a debt instrument, is attributable to the temporary investment of new equity capital and certain debt capital, and is received or accrued during the one-year period beginning on the date on which the REIT receives such new capital. After the one-year period following a qualifying equity or debt offering, income from investments of the proceeds of such offering will be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test only if derived from one of the other qualifying sources enumerated above. 
Asset Tests 
At the close of each quarter of each taxable year, we must also satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, real estate assets, cash and cash items, and government securities must represent at least 75% of the value of our total assets. Real estate assets include interests in real property (such as land, buildings, leasehold interests in real property and personal property leased with real property if the rents attributable to the personal property would be rents from real property under the income tests discussed above), interests in mortgages on real property or on interest in real property, shares in other qualifying REITs, debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs, and stock or debt instruments held for less than one year that are purchased with the proceeds from an offering of shares of our stock or certain long-term debt. Second, not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class. Third, of the investments that are not included in the 75% asset class and are not securities of our TRSs, (i) the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and (ii) we may not own more than 10% by vote or by value of any one issuer’s outstanding securities. For purposes of the 10% value test, debt instruments issued by a partnership are not classified as “securities” to the extent of our interest as a partner in such partnership (based on our proportionate share of the partnership’s equity interests and certain debt securities) or if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income, excluding income from prohibited transactions, is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. For purposes of the 10% value test, the term “securities” also does not include certain instruments, such as debt securities issued by another REIT, certain “straight debt” securities (for example, qualifying debt securities of a corporation of which we own no more than a de minimis amount of equity interest), loans to individuals or estates, and accrued obligations to pay rent. Fourth, securities of our TRSs cannot represent more than 20% of the value of our total assets. Fifth, not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered REITs that are not secured by mortgages on real property or interest in real property. Although we believe we have met these asset tests and we intend to continue to meet them, no assurance can be given that we have met them or will be able to do so. For purposes of these asset tests, we are treated as holding our proportionate share of our subsidiary partnerships’ assets. Also, for purposes of these asset tests, pursuant to an IRS ruling, we generally may treat shares of certain money market mutual funds as “cash items.” 
11


We will monitor the status of our assets for purposes of the various asset tests and will endeavor to manage our portfolio in order to comply at all times with such tests. If we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter, other than our first calendar quarter as a REIT, we will not lose our REIT status if one of the following exceptions applies: 


 | we satisfied the asset tests at the end of the preceding calendar quarter and the discrepancy between the value of our assets and the asset test requirements arose from changes in the market values of our assets and was not wholly or partly caused by the acquisition of one or more non-qualifying assets; or


 | we eliminate any discrepancy within 30 days after the close of the calendar quarter in which it arose.

Moreover, if we fail to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a calendar quarter during a taxable year, we will not lose our REIT status if one of the following additional exceptions applies: 


 | De Minimis Exception: the failure is due to a violation of the 5% or 10% asset tests referenced above and is “de minimis” (meaning that the failure is one that arises from our ownership of assets the total value of which does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the quarter in which the failure occurred and $10 million), and we either dispose of the assets that caused the failure or otherwise satisfy the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which our identification of the failure occurred; or


 | General Exception: all of the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the failure does not qualify for the above De Minimis Exception, (ii) the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) we file a schedule in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations providing a description of each asset that caused the failure, and (iv) we either dispose of the assets that caused the failure or otherwise satisfy the asset tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which our identification of the failure occurred. A REIT that utilizes this general relief provision must pay an excise tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 or (b) the product of the net income generated during a specified period by the asset that caused the failure and the highest U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.

Annual Distribution Requirements 
In order to qualify as a REIT, each taxable year we must distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. We generally must pay such distributions in the taxable year to which they relate (or be treated as having paid such distributions in such year, as described further below under “Taxation of U.S. Shareholders -- Distributions”), or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. Subject to certain requirements, we may satisfy all or part of our distribution requirement by paying taxable stock dividends. 
To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain and REIT taxable income, we will be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, and potentially, state and local tax, on these retained amounts. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our “ordinary income,” as defined in Section 4981(e)(1) of the Code, for such year, (ii) 95% of our “capital gain net income,” as defined in Section 4981(e)(2) of the Code, for such year, and (iii) 100% of any corresponding undistributed amounts from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed plus retained income from such taxable year on which we paid corporate income tax. 
Under certain circumstances, we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to our shareholders in a later year that may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends. 
For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015, in order for our distributions to have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for REITs and provided us with a REIT-level tax deduction, the distributions must not have been “preferential dividends.” A dividend is not a preferential dividend if the distribution is (i) pro rata among all outstanding shares of stock within a particular class, and (ii) in accordance with the preferences among different classes of stock as set forth in our organizational documents. The preferential dividend rule for publicly offered REITs was repealed for distributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014. As such, we are no longer subject to these preferential dividend requirements. Any non-publicly offered REIT in which we invest would be subject to the preferential dividend rule regardless of the date of the distribution. 
12

Pursuant to an IRS ruling, the prohibition on preferential dividends applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015 did not prohibit REITs from offering shares under a distribution reinvestment plan at discounts of up to 5% of fair market value, but a discount in excess of 5% of the fair market value of the shares would have been considered a preferential dividend. We believe that our distribution reinvestment plan has complied with those requirements. 
We may retain and pay income tax on net long-term capital gains we received during the tax year. To the extent we so elect, (i) each shareholder must include in its income (as long-term capital gain) its proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gains, (ii) each shareholder is deemed to have paid, and receives a credit for, its proportionate share of the tax paid by us on the undistributed long-term capital gains, and (iii) each shareholder’s basis in its stock is increased by the included amount of the undistributed long-term capital gains less their share of the tax paid by us. 
To qualify as a REIT, we may not have, at the end of any taxable year, any undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non-REIT taxable year. We believe that we have not had any non-REIT earnings and profits at the end of any taxable year covered by this rule, and we intend to distribute any non-REIT earnings and profits that we accumulate before the end of any taxable year in which we accumulate such earnings and profits. 
Failure to Qualify 
If we fail to qualify as a REIT and such failure is not an asset test or gross income test failure subject to the cure provisions described above, or for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015 the result of preferential dividends, we generally will be eligible for a relief provision if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and we pay a penalty of $50,000 with respect to such failure. 
If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year and no relief provisions apply, we generally will be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income. Distributions to our shareholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made. In such event, to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, all distributions to our shareholders will be taxable as dividend income. Subject to certain limitations in the Code, corporate shareholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual, trust and estate shareholders may be eligible to treat the dividends received from us as qualified dividend income taxable as net capital gains, under the provisions of Section 1(h)(11) of the Code. However, non-corporate shareholders (including individuals) will not be able to deduct 20% of certain dividends they receive from us. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be ineligible to elect to be taxed as a REIT again prior to the fifth taxable year following the first year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT under the Code. 
Our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on our continuing to meet the various requirements summarized above governing the ownership of our outstanding stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income, and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders. Although we intend to operate in a manner that will enable us to comply with such requirements, there can be no certainty that such intention will be realized. In addition, because the relevant laws may change, compliance with one or more of the REIT requirements may become impossible or impracticable for us. 
Prohibited Transaction Tax 
Any gain realized by us on the sale of any property held (other than foreclosure property) as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, including our share of any such gain realized by our subsidiary partnerships, will be treated as income from a “prohibited transaction” that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. Whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends upon all the facts and circumstances with respect to the particular transaction. However, the Code provides a “safe harbor” pursuant to which sales of properties held for at least two years and meeting certain other requirements will not give rise to prohibited transaction income. 
We generally intend to hold properties for investment, but we have made and will make sales of properties consistent with our strategic objectives. We believe our past sales in open tax years are not considered prohibited transactions. However, we have made and we may make sales at a gain that do not satisfy the safe harbor requirements described above. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the 100% penalty tax. The 100% penalty tax will not apply to gains from the sale of property realized through a U.S. TRS or other U.S. taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax. 
Recordkeeping Requirements 
To avoid a monetary penalty, we must request on an annual basis information from certain of our shareholders designed to disclose the actual ownership of our outstanding stock. We intend to comply with these requirements. 
13

Qualified REIT Subsidiaries and Disregarded Entities 
If a REIT owns a subsidiary that is a “qualified REIT subsidiary,” or QRS, or if a REIT owns 100% of the membership interests in a domestic limited liability company or other domestic unincorporated entity that does not elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the separate existence of the QRS, limited liability company or other unincorporated entity generally will be disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, a QRS is a corporation, other than a TRS, all of the stock of which is owned by a REIT. All assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of the QRS or disregarded entity will be treated as assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of its owner. To the extent we own a QRS or a disregarded entity, neither will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation, although such entities may be subject to state and local taxation in some states or foreign taxes if they do business or own property outside the United States. 
Taxation of Subsidiary Partnerships 
We have held and may in the future hold investments through entities that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Code, a partnership generally is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, but is required to file a partnership tax information return each year. In general, the character of each partner’s share of each item of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit, and tax preference is determined at the partnership level. Each partner is then allocated a distributive share of such items and is required to take such items into account in determining the partner’s income. Each partner includes such amount in income for any taxable year of the partnership ending within or with the taxable year of the partner, without regard to whether the partner has received or will receive any cash distributions from the partnership. Cash distributions, if any, from a partnership to a partner generally are not taxable unless and to the extent they exceed the partner’s basis in its partnership interest immediately before the distribution. Any amounts in excess of such tax basis will generally be treated as a sale of such partner’s interest in the partnership. 
While generally the rules described above mean that a partnership is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, new rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may require the partnership to pay the hypothetical increase in partner-level taxes (including interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit or in other tax proceedings (an “imputed underpayment”), unless the partnership elects an alternative method under which the taxes resulting from the adjustment (and interest and penalties) are assessed at the partner level (often referred to as a “push-out election”), subject to a higher rate of interest than otherwise would apply. Treasury Regulations provide that when a push-out election affects a partner that is a REIT, such REIT may be able to use deficiency dividend procedures with respect to adjustments resulting from such election. It is possible that partnerships in which we directly and indirectly invest may be subject to U.S. federal income tax, interest and penalties in the event of a U.S. federal income tax audit as a result of these law changes, and as a result, we could be required to bear the economic costs of taxes attributable to our partners. 
For purposes of the REIT income and assets tests, a REIT that is a partner in a partnership will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and will be deemed to earn its proportionate share of the partnership’s income. The assets and gross income of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to REITs. Our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of any subsidiary partnership, including such partnership’s share of the assets and liabilities and items of income with respect to any partnership or disregarded entity in which it holds an interest, will be treated as our assets and liabilities and items of income for purposes of applying the REIT asset and income tests. 
We may form joint ventures taxed as partnerships and our joint venture partners may contribute property to such subsidiary partnerships. If our partner contributes appreciated property (i.e., property with a value in excess of adjusted tax basis) in exchange for a partnership interest, the subsidiary partnership’s initial tax basis in the property acquired generally will be less than the purchase price of the property. Although the partnership tax rules of Section 704(c) of the Code would generally attempt to provide us as the non-contributing partner with the depreciation deductions comparable to what we would receive if the subsidiary partnership purchased the appreciated assets for cash in a taxable transaction (and obtained an initial tax basis equal to the purchase price), absent certain elections, which would accelerate income to the contributor, the depreciation would be limited to tax basis. Consequently, our depreciation deductions for such properties may be less, and our tax gain on a sale of such properties may be more, than the deductions or gain, respectively, that we would have if the subsidiary partnership acquired these properties in taxable transactions. Alternatively, if we contribute appreciated property to a subsidiary partnership, such partnership may elect to use a method of allocation under Section 704(c) of the Code that accelerates income to us. 
The discussion above assumes that any subsidiary partnerships in which we invest will be treated as “partnerships” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, a domestic unincorporated entity with two or more owners is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless it affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. However, certain “publicly traded partnerships” are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code, a partnership that does not elect to be treated as a corporation nevertheless will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it is a “publicly traded partnership,” it does not derive at least 90% of its gross income from certain specified sources of “qualifying income” within the meaning of that provision and it meets certain other requirements. A “publicly traded partnership” is any 
14

partnership (i) the interests in which are traded on an established securities market or (ii) the interests in which are readily tradable on a “secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof.” Under the relevant Treasury Regulations, interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable on a secondary market or on the substantial equivalent of a secondary market if the partnership qualifies for specified “safe harbors,” which are based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to the partnership. For example, interests in a partnership are not readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof if (i) all interests in the partnership were issued in a transaction (or transactions) that was not required to be registered under the Securities Act, and (ii) the partnership does not have more than 100 partners at any time during the taxable year of the partnership (determined by counting indirect partners who held their partnership interest through certain flow-through entities). If any subsidiary partnership were a publicly traded partnership, it would be taxed as a corporation unless at least 90% of its gross income consists of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 of the Code. Qualifying income is generally real property rents and other types of passive income, and the income requirements applicable to us to qualify as a REIT under the Code and the definition of qualifying income under the publicly traded partnership rules are very similar. We intend to operate so that any subsidiary partnerships in which we invest will satisfy at least one of the above-mentioned safe harbors, and/or comply with the qualifying income exception, so as to avoid being taxed as a corporation under these rules. However, we may not control all of the subsidiary partnerships in which we may invest, and treatment of a subsidiary partnership as a corporation could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. 
Investments in Certain Debt Instruments 
We may acquire mortgage, mezzanine, bridge loans and other debt investments. If a mortgage loan is secured by both real property and personal property, then such mortgage shall be treated as a wholly qualifying real estate asset and all interest shall be treated as mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test, provided that the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed 15% of the total fair market value of all such property on the date that we committed to acquire or modify the loan (or on the date of disposition for purposes of whether gain from a disposition of the mortgage is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test), even if the real property collateral value is less than the outstanding balance of the loan. However, if a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and personal property does not satisfy the 15% test articulated in the previous sentence or if such mortgage loan is entered into or acquired in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016, then such mortgage may not be a qualifying real estate asset in its entirety for purposes of the 75% asset test and/or a portion of the interest income from such mortgage may not constitute qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test if the amount of the loan outstanding exceeds the fair market value of the real property collateral on the date that we committed to acquire or modify the loan. 
To the extent that we derive interest income from a mortgage loan where all or a portion of the amount of interest payable is contingent, such income generally will qualify for purposes of the gross income tests only if it is based upon the gross receipts or sales, and not the net income or profits, of the borrower. This limitation does not apply, however, where the borrower leases substantially all of its interest in the property to tenants or subtenants, to the extent that the rental income derived by the borrower would qualify as rents from real property had we earned the income directly. 
The application of the REIT provisions of the Code to certain mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity interests in an entity that directly or indirectly owns real property rather than by a direct mortgage of the real property, is not entirely clear. A safe harbor in IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-65 provides that if a mezzanine loan meets certain requirements then it will be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests and interest income derived from it will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, to the extent that mezzanine loans do not meet all of the requirements for reliance on the safe harbor set forth in IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-65, all or a portion of such mezzanine loans may not qualify as real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests and the interest income derived therefrom may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, which could adversely affect our REIT qualification if we acquired such loans. As such, the REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to acquire mortgage, mezzanine or other loans that we might otherwise desire to acquire. 
Investments in debt instruments may require recognition of taxable income prior to receipt of cash from such investments and may cause portions of gain to be treated as ordinary income. For example, we may purchase debt instruments at a discount from face value. To the extent we purchase any instruments at a discount in connection with their original issuances, the discount will be “original issue discount,” or OID, if it exceeds certain de minimis amounts, which must be accrued on a constant yield method even though we may not receive the corresponding cash payment until maturity. To the extent debt instruments are purchased by us at a discount after their original issuances, the discount may represent “market discount.” Unlike OID, market discount is not required to be included in income on a constant yield method. However, if we sell a debt instrument with market discount, we will be required to treat gain up to an amount equal to the market discount that has accrued while we held the debt instrument as ordinary income. Additionally, any principal payments we receive in respect of our debt instruments must be treated as ordinary income to the extent of any accrued market discount. If we ultimately collect less on a debt instrument than our purchase price and any OID or accrued market discount that we have included in income, there may be limitations on our ability to use any losses resulting from that debt instrument. We may acquire distressed debt instruments that are subsequently modified by agreement with 
15

the borrower. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, these modifications may be treated as a taxable event in which we exchange the old debt instrument for a new debt instrument, the value of which may be treated as equal to the face amount of the new debt instrument. Because distressed debt instruments are often acquired at a substantial discount from face value, the difference between our amount realized and our tax basis in the old note could be significant, resulting in significant income without any corresponding receipt of cash. Similarly, if we acquire a distressed debt instrument and subsequently foreclose, we could have taxable income to the extent that the fair market value of the property we receive exceeds our tax basis in the debt instrument. Such a scenario could also result in significant taxable income without any receipt of cash. In the event that any debt instruments acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments, or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due, we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income. 
We generally will be required to include certain amounts in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. The application of this rule may require the accrual of income with respect to our debt instruments earlier than would be the case under the general tax rules described in the preceding paragraph. 
Investments in TRSs 
We own a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and we may form additional TRSs. A TRS of ours is a corporation in which we directly or indirectly own stock and that jointly elects with us to be treated as a TRS under Section 856(l) of the Code. In addition, if a TRS owns, directly or indirectly, securities representing 35% or more of the vote or value of a subsidiary corporation, that subsidiary will also be treated as a TRS of ours. A domestic TRS (or a foreign TRS with income from a U.S. business) pays U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes at the full applicable corporate rates on its taxable income prior to payment of any dividends. A TRS owning property outside of the U.S. may pay foreign taxes. The taxes owed by a TRS could be substantial. To the extent that any of our TRSs is required to pay U.S. federal, state, local or foreign taxes, the cash available for distribution by us will be reduced accordingly. 
A TRS is permitted to engage in certain kinds of activities that cannot be performed directly by us without jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT. However, several provisions regarding the arrangements between a REIT and its TRS ensure that a TRS will be subject to an appropriate level of U.S. federal income taxation. For example, we will be obligated to pay a 100% penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by the TRS if the economic arrangements among us, our tenants, and/or the TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties. 
Taxation of U.S. Shareholders 
The term “U.S. shareholder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock or preferred stock that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any of its states or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust (a) that is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and the control of one or more U.S. persons or (b) that has a valid election in effect under the applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person under the Code. 
In addition, as used herein, the term U.S. shareholder does not include any individuals or entities that are subject to special treatment under the Code, such as (i) insurance companies; (ii) tax-exempt organizations (except to the limited extent discussed below); (iii) financial institutions or broker-dealers; (iv) U.S. expatriates; (v) persons who mark-to-market our common stock or preferred stock; (vi) subchapter S corporations; (vii) U.S. shareholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; (viii) regulated investment companies; (ix) holders who receive our common stock or preferred stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; (x) persons holding shares of our common stock or preferred stock as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction,” “synthetic security” or other integrated investment; (xi) persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code; (xii) persons holding our common stock or preferred stock through a partnership or similar pass-through entity; and (xiii) persons holding a 10% or more (by vote or value) beneficial interest in our stock. If a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding our stock, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the consequences of the ownership and disposition of shares of our stock by the partnership. This summary assumes that shareholders hold our stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally means property held for investment. 
Certain accrual method taxpayers are required to include certain amounts in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than the time such amounts are reflected on certain financial statements. This summary does not address the impact of those rules. 
Distributions
Distributions by us, other than capital gain dividends, will constitute ordinary dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions on our preferred stock will be treated as 
16

made out of any available earnings and profits in priority to distributions on our common stock. In general, these dividends will be taxable as ordinary income and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporate shareholders. However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, individuals and other non-corporate taxpayers generally may deduct 20% of dividends received from us, other than capital gain dividends or dividends treated as qualified dividend income, subject to certain limitations. Our ordinary dividends generally will not qualify as “qualified dividend income” currently taxed as net capital gain for U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts or estates. However, provided we properly designate the distributions, distributions to U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts or estates generally will constitute qualified dividend income taxed as net capital gains to the extent the U.S. shareholder satisfies certain holding period requirements and to the extent the dividends are attributable to (i) qualified dividend income we receive from other corporations during the taxable year, including from our TRSs, and (ii) our undistributed earnings or built-in gains taxed at the corporate level during the immediately preceding taxable year. We do not anticipate distributing a significant amount of qualified dividend income. 
The discussion in this section applies equally to distributions payable in cash and taxable stock distributions. The Code provides that certain distributions payable in stock will be treated as taxable stock dividends. In addition, shares acquired through a distribution reinvestment plan are treated as taxable stock dividends. Certain features, typically with respect to preferred stock, such as certain redemption premiums and conversion ratio adjustments that have the effect of increasing the affected shareholders’ interest in our earnings or assets, also may be treated as taxable stock dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable U.S. shareholders receiving taxable dividends of stock will be required to include as dividend income the fair market value of the stock received plus any cash or other property received in the distribution, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. 
To the extent that we make a distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (a “return of capital distribution”), a U.S. shareholder will first apply the distribution to reduce the shareholder’s tax basis in our stock, and the return of capital distribution will be tax-free to that extent. To the extent that a return of capital distribution exceeds a U.S. shareholder’s tax basis in its stock, the distribution will be taxable as capital gain realized from the sale of such stock. Under proposed Treasury Regulations, a shareholder would apply a return of capital distribution pro rata, on a share-by-share basis, to each share of stock held by the shareholder with the class of stock upon which the return of capital distribution is made. 
Dividends declared by us in October, November or December and payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated both as paid by us and as received by the shareholder on December 31 of the year to the extent of our remaining current and accumulated earnings and profits for such year, provided that the dividend is actually paid by us during January of the following calendar year. 
We will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax generally applicable to REITs if certain distribution requirements are not met. Moreover, any deficiency dividend will be treated as an ordinary or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be, regardless of our earnings and profits at the time the distribution is actually made. As a result, shareholders may be required to treat certain distributions as taxable dividends that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. 
Distributions that are properly designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year) without regard to the period for which the shareholder has held its stock. However, corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. In addition, U.S. shareholders may be required to treat a portion of any capital gain dividend as “unrecaptured Section 1250 gain,” taxable at a maximum rate of 25%, if we incur such gain. Capital gain dividends are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction for corporations. 
The REIT provisions of the Code do not require us to distribute our long-term capital gain, and we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net long-term capital gains received during the taxable year. If we so elect for a taxable year, our shareholders would include in income as long-term capital gains their proportionate share of retained net long-term capital gains for the taxable year as we may designate. A U.S. shareholder would be deemed to have paid its share of the tax paid by us on such undistributed capital gains, which would be credited or refunded to the shareholder. The U.S. shareholder’s basis in its stock would be increased by the amount of undistributed long-term capital gains (less the capital gains tax paid by us) included in the U.S. shareholder’s long-term capital gains.

Passive Activity Loss and Investment Interest Limitations; No Pass-Through of Losses 
Dividends paid by us and gain from the disposition of our common stock or preferred stock will not be treated as passive activity income and, therefore, U.S. shareholders will not be able to apply any “passive losses” against such income. With respect to non-corporate U.S. shareholders, our dividends (to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital) that are taxed at ordinary income rates will generally be treated as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitation; however, net capital gain from the disposition of our common stock or preferred stock (or distributions treated as such), capital gain dividends, and dividends taxed at net capital gains rates generally will be excluded from investment income except to the extent the U.S. shareholder elects to treat such amounts as ordinary income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. shareholders may not include in their own U.S. federal income tax returns any of our net operating or net capital losses. 
Sale or Disposition of Stock 
In general, any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares of our common stock or preferred stock by a shareholder that is not a dealer in securities will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the stock has been held for more than one year; otherwise it will be a short-term capital gain or loss. However, any loss upon a sale or exchange of the stock by a shareholder who has held such stock for six months or less (after applying certain holding period rules) will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of our distributions or undistributed capital gains required to be treated by such shareholder as long-term capital gain. All or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares of our common stock or preferred stock may be disallowed if the taxpayer purchases other shares of our common stock within 30 days before or after the disposition. 
A redemption by us of any redeemable preferred stock we may issue could be treated either as a taxable disposition of shares or as a dividend, depending on the applicable facts and circumstances. In the event we issue any redeemable preferred stock, the prospectus supplement will discuss the tax consequences of owning such securities in greater detail. 
Taxation of U.S. Tax-Exempt Shareholders 
In General 
In general, a tax-exempt organization is exempt from U.S. federal income tax on its income, except to the extent of its “unrelated business taxable income” or UBTI, which is defined by the Code as the gross income derived from any trade or business which is regularly carried on by a tax-exempt entity and unrelated to its exempt purposes, less any directly connected deductions and subject to certain modifications. For this purpose, the Code generally excludes from UBTI any gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of property (other than stock in trade or property held primarily for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business), dividends, interest, rents from real property, and certain other items. However, a portion of any such gains, dividends, interest, rents, and other items generally is UBTI to the extent derived from debt-financed property not related to the tax-exempt entity’s exempt purpose, based on the amount of “acquisition indebtedness” with respect to such debt-financed property. A U.S. tax-exempt shareholder that is subject to tax on its UBTI will be required to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI. Before making an investment in shares of our common stock or preferred stock, a tax-exempt shareholder should consult its tax advisors with regard to UBTI and the suitability of the investment in our stock. 
Distributions we make to a tax-exempt employee pension trust or other domestic tax-exempt shareholder or gains from the disposition of our common stock or preferred stock held as capital assets generally will not constitute UBTI unless the exempt organization’s stock is debt-financed property (e.g., the shareholder has incurred “acquisition indebtedness” with respect to such stock). However, if we are a “pension-held REIT,” this general rule may not apply to distributions to certain pension trusts that are qualified trusts (as defined above) and that hold more than 10% (by value) of our stock. We will be treated as a “pension-held REIT” if (i) treating qualified trusts as individuals would cause us to fail the 5/50 Test (as defined above) and (ii) we are “predominantly held” by qualified trusts. We will be “predominantly held” by qualified trusts if either (i) a single qualified trust holds more than 25% by value of our stock or (ii) one or more qualified trusts, each owning more than 10% by value of our stock, hold in the aggregate more than 50% by value of our stock. In the event we are a pension-held REIT, the percentage of any dividend received from us treated as UBTI would be equal to the ratio of (a) the gross UBTI (less certain associated expenses) earned by us (treating us as if we were a qualified trust and, therefore, subject to tax on UBTI) to (b) our total gross income (less certain associated expenses). A de minimis exception applies where the ratio set forth in the preceding sentence is less than 5% for any year; in that case, no dividends are treated as UBTI. We cannot assure you that we will not be treated as a pension-held REIT. 
Special Issues 
Social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations and supplemental unemployment benefit trusts that are exempt from taxation under paragraphs (7), (9) and (17), respectively, of Section 501(c) of the Code are subject to different UBTI rules, which generally will require them to characterize distributions from us as UBTI. 
18

Taxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders 
The rules governing U.S. federal income taxation of beneficial owners of our stock who are not U.S. persons, such as nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations, and foreign trusts and estates (“non-U.S. shareholders”), are complex. This section is only a partial discussion of such rules. This discussion does not attempt to address the considerations that may be relevant for non-U.S. shareholders that are partnerships or other pass-through entities, that hold their common stock or preferred stock through intermediate entities, that have special statuses (such as sovereigns), or that otherwise are subject to special rules under the Code. This discussion also generally is limited to investments in classes of our stock that are regularly traded on an established securities market. 
Distributions 
A non-U.S. shareholder that receives a distribution that is not attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of “United States real property interests” (as defined below) and that we do not designate as a capital gain dividend or retained capital gain generally will recognize ordinary dividend income to the extent that we pay the distribution out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. A U.S. federal withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of the distribution ordinarily will apply unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates the tax. Under many treaties, lower withholding rates do not apply to dividends from REITs or are available in limited circumstances. However, if a distribution is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business, the non-U.S. shareholder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the distribution at graduated rates (in the same manner as U.S. shareholders are taxed on distributions) and also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a corporate non-U.S. shareholder. We generally plan to withhold U.S. income tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any distribution paid to a non-U.S. shareholder (including any portion of any dividend that is payable in our stock) unless either (i) a lower treaty rate or special provision of the Code (e.g., Section 892) applies and the non-U.S. shareholder provides to us any required IRS Form W-8 (for example, an IRS Form W-8BEN) evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate or (ii) the non-U.S. shareholder provides with us an IRS Form W-8ECI claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income, or (iii) we determined that a different withholding rate is appropriate (such as because we can determine at the time of distribution that the distribution is a capital gain dividend or is attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of “United States real property interests”). 
A non-U.S. shareholder generally will not incur U.S. federal income tax (but will be subject to withholding as described below) on a return of capital distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits that is not attributable to the gain from our disposition of a “United States real property interest” if the excess portion of the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the non-U.S. shareholder’s stock. Instead, the excess portion of the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the stock. However, a non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to tax on such a distribution that exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the non-U.S. shareholder’s adjusted basis in the stock if the non-U.S. shareholder otherwise would be subject to tax on gain from the sale or disposition of its stock, as described below. Because we generally cannot determine at the time we make a distribution whether or not the distribution will exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, we normally will withhold tax on the entire amount of any distribution at the same rate as we would withhold on a dividend. 
We may be required to withhold 15% of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits even if a lower treaty rate applies to dividends or the non-U.S. shareholder is not liable for tax on the receipt of that distribution. Consequently, to the extent that we do not withhold at a rate of 30% on the entire amount of any distribution, we generally expect to withhold at a rate of 15% on the portion of the distribution that we do not withhold at a rate of 30%,. unless we conclude that an exemption or different rate applies. 
A non-U.S. shareholder may seek a refund from the IRS if the non-U.S. shareholder’s withholdings and any other tax payments exceed its U.S. federal income tax liability for the year. 
Subject to the exception discussed below for 10% or smaller holders of classes of stock of a corporation that are regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States and the special rules for “qualified shareholders” or “qualified foreign pension funds” discussed below, a non-U.S. shareholder will incur tax on distributions that are attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of “United States real property interests” under special provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, or FIRPTA, regardless of whether we designate such distributions as capital gain dividend. The term “United States real property interests” includes interests in U.S. real property and stock in U.S. corporations at least 50% of whose assets consist of interests in U.S. real property. Under those rules, a non-U.S. shareholder is taxed on distributions attributable to gain from sales of United States real property interests as if the gain were effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business. A non-U.S. shareholder thus would be taxed on such a distribution at the normal capital gain rates applicable to U.S. shareholders, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax. A corporate non-U.S. shareholder not entitled to treaty relief or exemption also may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax on such a distribution. We will be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 21% of any distributions to non-U.S. shareholders attributable to gain from our sale or exchange 
19

of United States real property interests (“FIRPTA Withholding”). A non-U.S. shareholder may receive a credit against its tax liability for the amount we withhold. 
A non-U.S. shareholder that owns, actually or constructively, no more than 10% of our common stock (or preferred stock) at all times during the one-year period ending on the date of a distribution with respect to such stock should not be subject to FIRPTA, branch profits tax or FIRPTA Withholding with respect to a distribution on that stock that is attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of United States real property interests, provided that the class of stock in question continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States. In the case of any such distribution that was a capital gain dividend made to such non-U.S. shareholder, the distribution will be treated as an ordinary dividend subject to the general withholding rules discussed above, which generally impose a withholding tax equal to 30% of the gross amount of each dividend distribution (unless reduced by treaty). 
Distributions that are designated by us as capital gain dividends but that are not attributable to the disposition of a United States real property interest, generally should not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless: 


(i) | such distribution is effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s U.S. trade or business and, if certain treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. shareholder, in which case the non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to tax on a net basis in a manner similar to the taxation of U.S. shareholders with respect to such gain, except that a holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the additional 30% branch profits tax; or


(ii) | the non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and meets certain other criteria, in which case such nonresident alien individual generally will be subject to a 30% tax on the individual’s net U.S. source capital gain.

Notwithstanding that such non-FIRPTA capital gain dividend may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation, as noted above we generally plan to withhold U.S. federal income tax at the rate of 30% on the gross amount of any dividend distribution paid to a non-U.S. shareholder and we may be required to withhold not less than 21% of any such capital gain dividends (or amounts we could have designated as such). Distributions can be designated as capital gain dividends to the extent of our net capital gain for the taxable year of the distribution. The amount withheld is creditable against the non-U.S. shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability.
Although the law is not clear on the matter, it appears that amounts designated by us as undistributed capital gains generally should be treated with respect to non-U.S. shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends. Under that approach, non-U.S. shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability resulting therefrom an amount equal to their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on the undistributed capital gains and to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of this tax paid by us exceeds their actual U.S. federal income tax liability. 
Dispositions 
If gain on the sale of our common stock or preferred stock were taxed under FIRPTA, a non-U.S. shareholder would be taxed on that gain in the same manner as U.S. shareholders with respect to that gain, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax. A non-U.S. shareholder generally will not incur tax under FIRPTA on a sale or other disposition of our common stock or preferred stock if we are a “domestically controlled qualified investment entity,” which requires that, during the five-year period ending on the date of the distribution or disposition, non-U.S. shareholders hold, directly or indirectly, less than 50% in value of our stock and we are qualified as a REIT. For such testing periods that end on or after December 18, 2015, a person holding less than 5% of our regularly traded classes of stock for five years has been, and will be, treated as a U.S. person unless we have actual knowledge that such person is not a U.S. person. Because our common stock is publicly traded, we cannot assure you that we are or will be in the future a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. However, gain recognized by a non-U.S. shareholder from a sale of our common stock or preferred stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market will not be subject to tax under FIRPTA if (i) our stock is considered regularly traded under applicable Treasury Regulations on an established securities market, such as the NYSE, and (ii) the non-U.S. shareholder owned, actually and constructively, 10% or less of the value of such class of stock at all times during the specified testing period ending on the date of the disposition. The testing period referred to in the previous sentence is the shorter of (x) the period during which the non-U.S. shareholder held the stock and (y) the five-year period ending on the date of the disposition. We believe that our common stock is currently regularly traded on an established securities market. Non-U.S. shareholders should consult their tax advisors as to the availability of the exception for holders of less than 10% of our stock in the case of a class of our stock that is not regularly traded on an established securities market. 
In addition, even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity, upon a disposition of our common stock or preferred stock, a non-U.S. shareholder may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property 
20

interest if the non-U.S. shareholder (i) disposes of an interest in our common stock or preferred stock during the 30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution, any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest, and (ii) directly or indirectly acquires, enters into a contract or option to acquire, or is deemed to acquire, other shares of our common stock or preferred stock within 30 days before or after such ex-dividend date. The foregoing rule does not apply if the exception described above for dispositions by 10% or smaller holders of regularly traded classes of stock is satisfied. 
Furthermore, a non-U.S. shareholder generally will incur tax on gain not subject to FIRPTA if (i) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. shareholder’s U.S. trade or business and, if certain treaties apply, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. shareholder, in which case the non-U.S. shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. shareholders with respect to such gain and may be subject to the 30% branch profits tax in the case of a non-U.S. corporation, or (ii) the non-U.S. shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the United States, in which case the non-U.S. shareholder will generally incur a 30% tax on his or her net U.S. source capital gains. 
Purchasers of our common stock or preferred stock from a non-U.S. shareholder generally will be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 15% of the purchase price unless at the time of purchase (i) any class of our stock is regularly traded on an established securities market (subject to certain limits if the shares of stock sold are not themselves part of such a regularly traded class) or (ii) we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. The non-U.S. shareholder may receive a credit against his or her U.S. tax liability for the amount withheld. 
Special FIRPTA Rules 
To the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a “qualified shareholder,” it will not be treated as a United States real property interest for such qualified shareholder. Thus, gain treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock (including distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock) will not be subject to tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified shareholder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business. Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest (and capital gain dividends and non-dividend distributions to such shareholder may be treated as ordinary dividends). For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. shareholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the NYSE or Nasdaq, (ii) is a “qualified collective investment vehicle” (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more “applicable investors,” the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder’s stock (with “applicable percentage” generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of United States real property interest. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an “applicable investor” is a person (other than a qualified shareholder) who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. 
For FIRPTA purposes, neither a “qualified foreign pension fund” nor an entity all of the interests of which are held by a qualified foreign pension fund is treated as a non-U.S. shareholder. Accordingly, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of ordinary dividends received by qualified foreign pension funds and their wholly owned non-U.S. subsidiaries will be determined without regard to the FIRPTA rules discussed above, and their gain from the sale or exchange of our stock, as well as our capital gain dividends and distributions treated as gain from the sale or exchange of our stock, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless such gain is treated as effectively connected with the qualified foreign pension fund’s (or the wholly owned subsidiary’s) conduct of a U.S. trade or business. A “qualified foreign pension fund” is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees by either (A) a foreign country as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers, or (B) one or more employers in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities, and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible 
21

or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Returns 
If a non-U.S. shareholder is subject to taxation under FIRPTA on proceeds from the sale of our common stock or preferred stock or on distributions, the non-U.S. shareholder will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return. 
Information Reporting Requirements and Backup Withholding Tax Applicable to Shareholders 
U.S. Shareholders. In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of distributions on our stock and payments of the proceeds of the sale of our stock to some shareholders. Further, the payor will be required to backup withhold on any payments at the current rate of 24% if: 
(1) the payee fails to furnish a taxpayer identification number, or TIN, to the payor or establish an exemption from backup withholding; 
(2) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect; or 
(3) the payee fails to certify under the penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to backup withholding under the Code; or 
(4) there has been a notified payee underreporting with respect to dividends described in Code Section 3406(c). 
Some U.S. shareholders, including corporations and tax-exempt organizations, will be exempt from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a shareholder will be allowed as a credit against the shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax and may entitle the shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS on a timely basis. 
Non-U.S. Shareholders. Information reporting requirements and backup withholding may apply to (i) payments of distributions on our stock to a non-U.S. shareholder and (ii) proceeds a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our stock. Information reporting and backup withholding will generally not apply if an appropriate IRS Form W-8 is duly provided by such non-U.S. shareholder or the shareholder otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the shareholder is a U.S. person or that the claimed exemption is not in fact satisfied. Even without having executed an appropriate IRS Form W-8 or substantially similar form, however, in some cases information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to proceeds received through a broker’s foreign office that a non-U.S. shareholder receives upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of our stock. However, this exemption does not apply to brokers that are U.S. persons and certain foreign brokers with substantial U.S. ownership or operations. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is allowable as a credit against such shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability (which might entitle such holder to a refund), provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS. Payments not subject to information reporting requirements may nonetheless be subject to other reporting requirements. 
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding Rules 
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, provisions of the Code, subject to administrative guidance and certain intergovernmental agreements entered into thereunder, impose a 30% withholding tax on certain types of payments made to ‘‘foreign financial institutions’’ (as specifically defined in the Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities unless (i) the foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owners) undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity (as the beneficial owner or, in certain cases, as an intermediary for the beneficial owners) either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner. If the payee is a foreign financial institution that is not subject to special treatment under certain intergovernmental agreements, it must enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements. The compliance requirements under FATCA are complex and special requirements may apply to certain categories of payees. Withholding under this legislation may apply with respect to certain types of passive income from sources within the United States, which include dividend income from our stock. However, FATCA withholding will not apply to amounts treated as income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States or (ii) distributions and proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our stock. 
22

Medicare Tax 
A U.S. shareholder that is an individual is subject to a 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) his or her “net investment income” for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of his or her modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold (currently between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s U.S. federal income tax filing status). A similar regime applies to certain estates and trusts. Net investment income generally would include dividends on our common stock and preferred stock (without regard to the 20% deduction allowed by Section 199A of the Code) and gain from the sale of our common stock and preferred stock. If you are a U.S. person that is an individual, an estate or a trust, you are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the applicability of this tax to your income and gains in respect of your investment in our common stock and preferred stock. 
Recent Tax Legislation 
The recently enacted legislation informally knows as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, is generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and made significant changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of businesses and their owners, including REITs, their shareholders and holders of their debt securities. Among other changes not reflected in the discussion above, the TCJA (i) reduces the U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income of individuals, trusts and estates for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026 and on corporations indefinitely, (ii) limits the deductibility of interest expense, and (iii) limits the use of net operating losses. The effect of the TCJA on us and our shareholders is still uncertain, and administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. Any technical corrections with respect to the TCJA could have an adverse effect on us or our shareholders. 
Additional Legislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs 
The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department and it is possible that there could be future changes that could adversely impact our shareholders. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to us and our shareholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations of federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in our common stock or preferred stock. 
State, Local and Foreign Tax 
We may be subject to state, local and foreign tax in states, localities and foreign countries in which we do business or own property. The tax treatment applicable to us and our shareholders in such jurisdictions may differ from the U.S. federal income tax treatment described above. The TCJA also disallows itemized deductions for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026 for individuals for state and local income, property and sales taxes in excess of a combined limit of $10,000 ($5,000 for a married individual filing a separate return) per year.
