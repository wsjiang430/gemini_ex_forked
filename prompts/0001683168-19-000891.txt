History
 
We were originally formed on March 20, 2014, as a Colorado limited liability company. In March 2017, we converted to a corporation and issued 193.3936722 shares of our Common Stock for every Member Interest issued and outstanding on the date of conversion.
 
In August 2016, when still an LLC, we undertook a private offering of our member interests wherein we received subscriptions of $575,107 in the form of 6,392 member interests to three (3) accredited investors (approximately $90 per member interest, or approximately $0.46 per share based upon the conversion rate of 193.3936722 shares per member interest issued when we converted into a corporation in 2017). These funds were used to (i) add two systems designers to expand our Cultivation Technologies team to support market demand; (ii) expand our operations into the expanding fertigation marketplace as States approving legalized cannabis increased, (iii) hire a mechanical engineer to begin vetting opportunities to add IP and technology to our future business offering, (iv) hired a strategic financial consultant to aid in compiling a business forecast model;, and (v) fund working capital to support brand building marketing initiatives focused on trade show participation and an Increased on-hand inventory position.
 
In May 2017, we commenced a private offering of our Common Stock wherein we received subscriptions of $2,546,000 from the sale of 2,546,000 shares, at $1 per share, to 76 investors, including 58 “accredited” investors, as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These funds were used to repay debt, expansion of our existing business operations, new investment opportunities and working capital.
 
Thereafter, on May 15, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) wherein we registered 4,157,936 shares of our Common Stock with the SEC. Our registration statement became effective on August 8, 2018. As part of this process we also filed a registration statement on Form 8-A, causing our Common Stock to be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
In June 2018, we formed urban-gro Canada Technologies, Inc. as a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary company which we intend to utilize for all of our Canadian sales operations in the future.

Since inception, we have serviced over 500 clients and have designed and assisted in build out of over 75 facilities owned by some of the largest multi-state cannabis focused operating companies in both the United States and Canada. While no assurances can be provided, we forecast over a thousand customers will be purchasing our cultivation products bi-monthly by 2020, provided that additional countries and states in the US continue to adopt legislation approving the use of medical or recreational marijuana. According to Viridian Capital Advisors, an estimated $13.8 billion was raised by cannabis companies in 2018. A significant portion of this capital is expected to be used for facility buildouts. New Cannabis Ventures reported that as of April 2018 there were over 7,000 cultivation licenses issued in the US. This number is rapidly increasing as more states enter the legal cannabis industry. While no assurances can be provided, we believe this gives us a large and growing market.
 
To date, our revenues have been derived from sales to the cannabis industry. On average, our revenues have grown by 70% per year since 2015. During 2018 we provided services to over 1.2 million square feet of canopy to the cannabis industry.
 
Our primary business purpose is to engage directly with large scale indoor and greenhouse commercial cultivators growing high-value crops and design and engineer state of the art facilities and systems that focus on maximizing plants yields and lowering overall operational costs. We have and will continue to work with grow operations and production facilities to pursue strategies to, provide services, products, and other potential revenue-producing opportunities in the high value crop arenas. We engage directly with the ownership groups and growers at these facilities and strategically work with them to provide value-added services and industry best products that assist them in lowering production costs and increasing crop yields. We believe our customers work with us because we save them time, money, and resources.

In 2018, we accomplished several objectives, including the hiring and placement of our executive leadership team. We consider this a major milestone. To help us efficiently and effectively accomplish our growth objectives, management believes that hiring qualified, experienced persons and placing them into executive management is critical. During 2018 we hired George R. Pullar, our CFO; Larry Dodson, our CTO; Dan Droller, our EVP of Corporate and Business Development; and, Jonathan Nassar, our EVP of Sales. With this team in place, we believe we have the leadership necessary to help us to continue to expand our business. See “Part III, Item 10, Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance”: included in our Proxy Statement, which has been incorporated herein as if set forth.
 
As discussed below we also increased our ownership in key technology companies. We believe that the additional investment into EDYZA (additional 5% ownership) and Total Grow Holdings (additional 10% ownership in 2018 and an additional 15% in 2019) will allow our technology team to continually integrate and solidify the Soleil Sense & Control platform to further gain meaningful and valuable insight from the mined data available in a closed-loop platform.
 
In 2018, we surpassed the 50-employee mark, and consequently, decided to seek out additional office space. The Company opened a satellite office in the downtown WeWork The Lab facility. This centrally located office allows us access to the larger technology and engineering talents pools located in the Denver metro area and the Denver Tech Center. Our technology team and design teams are now located in this facility. See “Item 2, Properties” below.

Product Branding and Strategy; Soleil® 360 Ag-Tech Platform, Soleil® Sense and Soleil® Control Technologies
 
Soleil® 360 Ag-Tech Platform
 
Soleil Technologies is one of our divisions. The Soleil’s technology platform comprises a Cloud-based services back-end management and administration system, and an intuitive customer graphical user interface (GUI). It is built with the capability to handle over 22 billion records per annum, and several thousands of subscription-paying customers.
 
Soleil sensors are connected to the Soleil 360 Platform employing a robust, high performance, proprietary, tree-mesh wireless network topology. The user interface is designed for intuitive ease-of-use navigation of the customer’s systems, and as a universal user interface that will integrate all typically disparate systems within the grow environment.
 
The Soleil 360 business model is a subscription-based, high-value data services product. Hardware and network services remain the property of the company, and subscription fees provide for data hosting, data analysis, reporting and visualizations. The subscription sales contracts will increase adoption in the industry due to lower capital costs for acceptance and implementation by customers.
 
Standard and customized data visualizations are provided and available, and types and details are dependent on the subscribed level of service. Standard reporting consists of graphs and charts, and custom visualizations also include Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality data representations.
 
Soleil® Sense
 
The Soleil 360 technology platform utilizes Soleil Sensors to acquire data within the grow environment. Sensed data is transmitted over the wireless network and to Soleil 360 Cloud services. Data undergoes processing for reporting analysis and data visualizations important to the grower for actions and corrections to the grow environment equilibrium and balance. The current Soleil sensor product family includes sensing for temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, organic compounds, barometric pressure, soil moisture, conductance (nutrients), and grow light output intensity. The combination of sensing with the environmental factors that are measured, are essential components to achieve the careful balance of a grow environment.

The platform leverages sensor data and machine-based learning in order to reduce operating costs and increase yields. Scalable to thousands of ultra-high-efficiency sensors, growers are able to access real-time, actionable data from anywhere in the world and use that insight to optimize growing conditions or address potential issues before they affect the crop. 
 
Target applications goals of Soleil technologies are as complete solutions utilized by customers for increased operational efficiency, efficient use of hardware and network systems, reduced waste, all leading to improvements in profitability.
 
As water resources become scarce and transportation, energy, and labor costs rise, CEA (Controlled Environment Agriculture, the production of cannabis, vegetables, and flowers indoors) is quickly gaining popularity across the globe. The ability to precisely control environmental and plant conditions in a regulated, indoor environment helps optimize crop yield and quality. With just a few clicks, growers are able to assess temperature, moisture content, nutrient content, and pH—among other factors—in order to maintain ideal growing conditions. While existing substrate (soil) sensing technology is very costly to implement and is subject to scalability, wire, efficiency, and reliability constraints, the demand for real-time data is on the rise.

In addition to environmental and soil sensing, the same platform is being leveraged to economically monitor mission critical mechanical systems using vibration, energy consumption, and temperature. The sensors will alert cultivators to potential equipment failures like broken fans, clogged emitters, or inefficient HVAC systems.
 
Soleil® Control – Focus on Vertical Integration
 
As the cannabis industry consolidates and larger players enter, we believe that the ability to manage operations on a massive scale is a key differentiator that allows cultivators to drive higher yields at lower costs. Since our inception, our management has designed and engineered a multitude of projects that seek to leverage scale that also require complex and sophisticated climate and fertigation controls.  Based on these insights and experiences we recognized that the current technology available in the agricultural space is not sufficient, scalable or flexible to meet the growing and complex demands of cultivators seeking to maximize yields in cannabis and modern horticulture and agriculture.  In that light, we sought out new and highly sophisticated tools that brought together the latest in a broad spectrum of controls technologies.
 
In February 2018, we acquired a 5% interest in Total Grow Holdings, LLC ("TGH"), for $125,000. TGH was borne out of the highly complex petrochemical industry. This agreement also provides us with the right to purchase an additional 5% on a fully diluted basis at the same valuation on or before August 31, 2018. We also have the right to name one of the three Board members to the company. The TGH technology and the management team experiences bring us the ability to meet our increasingly complex needs of supplying product and services to the larger sized cannabis grow operations that are being developed as the cannabis industry matures. TGH markets their products under the brand name Total Grow Control.
 
In the second quarter of 2018 we launched a co-branded product called Soleil® Control powered by Total Grow Control (TGC). The Soleil® Control platform combines climate, environmental and lighting controls. 
 
In the second quarter of 2018 we also partnered with TGH to develop and launch a line of fertigation products in the form a Batch Fertigation System and an Inline Fertigation System. We believe these two systems position us to meet the needs of cultivators seeking to maintain strict nutrient recipe mixes in smaller controlled environment (Batch) and for those seeking to scale a fertigation system for more expansive cultivations (Inline.)

Soleil® Lighting Product Line
 
Over the course of the last several years as the cannabis market matured and grew more competitive, we witnessed downward pressure on the pricing and margins of grow light systems. In response to this evolution of the industry our lighting team sought a middle-market alternative to the high-end systems previously marketed. In 2016, we began manufacturing our own fixtures under the Soleil® brand. First to market was our 315W Ceramic Metal Halide system for vegetative growth stage. The following year, Soleil® introduced a 1000W Double-Ended High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) grow light system for the flower growth stage. This fixture features wireless control capability, dimming options, two reflector options (wide and narrow) to accommodate desired light distribution, and various hanging methods (greenhouse bracket, chain, unistrut bracket, custom brackets). Testing by a third-party lab has verified that the Soleil® HPS fixture delivers comparable intensity and light distribution relative to the most superior fixtures on the market. All Soleil® fixtures are ETL listed and assembled either at our facility in Colorado or at our partner’s facility in Asia.
 
While the prevalence of LED lighting is growing in the horticulture market, traditional HID Lighting still maintains the majority of the market share. Industry indicators suggest that trend will continue as LED systems are tested in facilities and the price of technology decreases to achieve a reasonable ROI.
 
Opti-Dura® Cultivation Product & Equipment Offering 
 
Since commencement of adult-use legalization in 2014, the price of legal, commercially produced cannabis has dropped from highs of $5,000 per lb., to below $1,000 per lb. in some mature state markets. We expect this trend to continue as additional states adopt legal cannabis. We believe this is a positive develop as it drives out the black and grey markets.
 
With lower product prices there is increased interest in reducing cultivation costs through procurement of new products and equipment. We have created a high-quality, value-driven “house brand” of cultivation products and equipment. Our sourcing of cultivation products and equipment has been researched and developed by cultivators – those who know first-hand the quality and specifications desired by cultivators.
 
Our OPTI-DURA product line includes:
 

· | OPTI-DURA Large-Scale Pesticide Applicators - Many cannabis cultivators have grown from small operations over the years. As they have grown, they have kept application processes that are out-of-date and inefficient for larger-scale operations. Our OPTI-DURA commercial pesticide applicators are made in America and built by farmers. They are a must-have for commercial cannabis facilities utilizing high pressures and special spray nozzles that help get under the leaves where pests like to hide. We are an exclusive distributor of the heaviest duty sprayers on the market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | OPTI-DURA Nutrients and Fertilizers – Currently in development, OPTI-DURA nutrients and fertilizers are expected to significantly reduce the price of these key components to cultivation. The nutrient and fertilizer lines will enable cultivators to “dial in” the needs of specific strains for high quality, consistent cannabis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SALES STRATEGY

Our Soleil® climate sensors and environmental controls offer real-time data to make informed decisions to optimize crop environments, preventing crop loss through actionable alerts and programmed responses to conditions.
 
We generate our profits based on the value we provide for design, engineering, and systems expertise.  We begin projects by using a proprietary project estimation tool that inputs multiple variables about the size and complexity of a potential new facility or a retrofitted facility. The output of the tool estimates the dollar amount of design and engineering time, systems, materials, project management, and miscellaneous costs necessary to provide a system that meets the needs of the customer. Once the project estimate is determined, a design fee and project deposit are determined. The design fee is a function of the complexity of the controls system, the number of irrigation zones, types of nutrients used, and the number of individual plants that require individual irrigation. The project deposit is between 10% and 15% of total project cost and varies based complexity and type of systems.
 
When the customer approves the estimate and pays the respective fee and deposit, our designers and engineers begin configuring and customizing the system. When a final design is approved by the customer, we then determine a final cost for time and materials and provides a final quote to meet all specifications. We then collect an order deposit to begin the procurement process.  Within two weeks of system readiness, we collect a final deposit from the customer. We then ship the final system to our customer. Once the system is installed by the customer’s chosen mechanical, electrical and plumbing contractors we dispatch an engineering team to commission the system.
 
To date, the cost to our customers for our systems have ranged between $75,000 and $2,500,000, depending upon depending on the size of cultivation, the complexity of systems, types, and the number of systems utilized from our product portfolio. We do not provide financing.
 
Subsequent Event
 
Effective March 7, 2019, we acquired 100% of the stock of Impact Engineering, Inc., a provider of mechanical and electrical engineering services. Since 2009, Impact has operated in the cannabis industry under the dba “Grow2Guys”. We issued an aggregate of 500,000 shares of our Common Stock in exchange for all of the issued and outstanding stock of Impact Engineering (hereinafter referred to as “Impact” or “Grow2Guys”).
 
We believe this acquisition will allow us to consolidate our internal fertigation design team with the Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing design team of Impact. The consolidation of this group allows us the opportunity to continue to deliver integrated designs for all of the key systems in a large, commercial grow. With the ability to have Professionally Engineered (PE) stamping to all of our designs, this solution will also bring considerable cost reduction opportunities to our customers.
 
Grow2Guys has provided full-service mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineering services for commercial owners since 1982. Its services include:
 

· | HVAC engineering and design;
--+-----------------------------


· | plumbing engineering and design;
--+---------------------------------


· | electrical engineering and design; and
--+---------------------------------------


· | documentation for the building permits necessary to obtain Certificate of Occupancy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Impact has provided design and engineering services for over 300 cannabis related facilities across North America, including cultivation and extraction facilities, dispensaries, and MIP kitchens. The firm’s customer base includes U.S. and Canadian single facility owners and multi-state operators with cultivation facilities ranging from 5,000 square feet to over 200,000 square feet. With this industry-specific experience, Impact has developed significant expertise in cannabis facility design and engineering, which we believe compliments our current operations. Impact is licensed to provide professional engineering services and stamp drawings in 47 states.

During each of its past two fiscal years Impact generated revenues in excess of $700,000, with 5 figure net profits in each year. Management expects that this accretive acquisition will have an immediate positive impact on our revenues and favorably impact our goal of attaining profitability in the near future.
 
As a result of the acquisition, Impact is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company, allowing us to engage with cultivators earlier in the design process. While no assurances can be provided, we believe that this avenue for early engagement will support our continued growth in the cannabis sector, providing facility design, products, solutions, and agricultural technology. Through the acquisition of Impact we expect to expand our cultivation system design operations which, together with our full-service MEP engineering services, should allow us to effectively engage customers much earlier during the building design stage.  Our firms’ combined experience allows us to now offer the market a united team highly experienced in the end-to-end design and delivery of optimized cultivation systems.
 
Management believes the acquisition of Impact will improve our ability to better serve our current and future customer base by expanding on the fully integrated products and services that we currently offer. While we have acquired Impact for coordinated building and cultivations systems design, we intend to continue to expand our current relationships, as well as to develop new relationships with regional MEP engineering firms in other regions throughout North America. 
 
With the addition of the Impact team our number of employees expands with the addition of five full-time employees, including 37-year mechanical engineering veteran and founder of Impact, Brian Zimmerman, who is a licensed professional engineer (PE). Other added positions include a project manager and three mechanical designers. As part of the terms of the acquisition we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Zimmerman, who shall remain as the President of Impact. Impact will operate at our downtown Denver offices located at WeWork, The Lab, 4th floor, Room 4A, 2420 17th St., Denver, CO 80202.
 
Growth by Acquisitions
 
As discussed above, our management is always aware of other related companies and how they may positively impact our business. We have already consummated two acquisitions and intend to continue to engage in what we believe to be synergistic acquisitions or joint ventures with unrelated companies that we believe will enhance our business plan. Ultimately, our intent is to become a national or internationally branded cultivation company. One of the principal reasons why we have elected to become a reporting, trading company is to allow us to utilize our securities as compensation for these potential acquisitions. There are no assurances we will become a reporting, trading company or if we are so successful, that we will be able to consummate additional acquisitions using our securities as consideration, or at all.
 
There are numerous things that will need to occur in order to allow us to implement this aspect of our business plan and there are no assurances that any of these developments will occur, or if they do occur, that we will be successful in fully implementing our plan. Among other things, the most important developments that need to occur include the legalization and commercialization of marijuana in the United States Until this occurs, we will be unable to fully integrate all aspects of the marijuana industry under our corporate umbrella.
 
If we are successful, the acquisition of related, complimentary businesses is expected to increase revenues and profits by providing a broader range of services in vertical markets which are consolidated under one parent, thus reducing overhead costs by streamlining operations and eliminating duplicitous efforts and costs. There are no assurances that we will increase profitability if we are successful in acquiring other synergistic companies.
 
Management will seek out and evaluate related, complimentary businesses for acquisition. The integrity and reputation of any potential acquisition candidate will first be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it meets with management’s standards. Once targeted as a potential acquisition candidate, we will enter into negotiations with the potential candidate and commence due diligence evaluation of each business, including its financial statements, cash flow, debt, location and other material aspects of the candidate’s business. One of the principal reasons for our filing of our registration statement of which this Report is a part and the filing of an application to list our securities for trading is our intention to utilize the issuance of our securities as part of the consideration that we will pay for these proposed acquisitions. If we are successful in our attempts to acquire synergistic companies utilizing our securities as part or all of the consideration to be paid, our current shareholders will incur dilution.

In implementing a structure for a particular acquisition, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. On the consummation of a transaction, we do not intend that our present management and shareholders will no longer be in control of our Company.
 
As part of our investigation, our officers and directors will meet personally with management and key personnel, may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis of verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and take other reasonable investigative measures, to the extent of our limited financial resources and management expertise. The manner in which we participate in an acquisition will depend on the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of us and other parties, the management of the acquisition candidate and our relative negotiation strength.
 
We will participate in an acquisition only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate written agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require some specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, will set forth remedies on default and will include miscellaneous other terms.
 
Depending upon the nature of the acquisition, including the financial condition of the acquisition company, as a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “34 Act”), it may be necessary for such acquisition candidate to provide independent audited financial statements. If so required, we will not acquire any entity which cannot provide independent audited financial statements within a reasonable period of time after closing of the proposed transaction. If such audited financial statements are not available at closing, or within time parameters necessary to insure our compliance with the requirements of the 34 Act, or if the audited financial statements provided do not conform to the representations made by the candidate to be acquired in the closing documents, the closing documents will provide that the proposed transaction will be voidable, at the discretion of our present management. If such transaction is voided, the agreement will also contain a provision providing for the acquisition entity to reimburse us for all costs associated with the proposed transaction.
 
As of the date of this Report we have no agreement with any other entity to acquire such company or be acquired. We are engaged in discussions with various unaffiliated companies but there are no assurances that these discussions will result in any definitive agreement. We have not commenced due diligence activities on any other company, nor have we reach even a verbal agreement with any third party as to the terms and conditions of any such acquisition. There is no significant material acquisition that is probable to be consummated and there are no assurances that any such acquisition will occur in the future.
 
Competition
 
We have several niche competitors in the cannabis industry who offer limited solutions and some similar products as those offered by us, including many who have greater financial resources than we currently have available. Our competitors include wholesale horticulture dealers, but we believe their models are different than ours. To differentiate our model, we vet the ‘best in class’ solutions and that is the only product that we sell. For example, horticulture dealers such as Griffin Greenhouse sell thousands of products. Due to the extreme depth of their product line, their sales associates may know a couple of ‘features’ about a specific product, whereas our employees are trained specifically on not only why our product solutions are the best option for our customer, but on how they are to be used in order to reach their maximum effectiveness.

We market ourselves as a one-stop, “turnkey” provider of agricultural technology systems. The notion of being turnkey does separate us from other players in the industry who only specialize in a specific part of the entire process need to design, engineer and deliver these systems. The closest complete solution providers are greenhouse manufacturers like Connelly's and Nexus, but these providers do not provide design and engineering expertise for these large systems.
 
We do not believe we compete against electrical, mechanical or plumbing contractors (MEPs) but we do require their expertise to in providing the implementation of our systems. Our customers are required to directly contract with local MEPs to implement the solutions according to our design and the customer specifications.
 
We also do not experience significant competition from online sales or direct manufacturers. Direct manufacturers provide highly customized systems that require expertise to configure to specific customer needs, so direct manufacturers must partner with companies like us to customize, configure and deliver quality solutions.
 
In addition, we also compete with electrical contractors, online retailers and manufacturer direct sales.
 
There can be no guarantees that in the future other companies will not enter this arena by developing products that are in direct competition with us. We anticipate the presence as well as entry of other companies in this market space, but acknowledge that we may not be able to establish, or if established, maintain a competitive advantage. Some of these companies may have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. This may allow them to respond more quickly than us to market opportunities. It may also allow them to devote greater resources to the marketing, promotion and sale of their products and or services. These competitors may also adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential customers, employees, strategic partners, distribution channels and advertisers. Increased competition is likely to result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and a potential loss of market share.
 
Government Regulation
 
While we do not generate revenues from the direct sale of cannabis products, we are engaged in assisting companies who are so engaged in various start up aspects of the cannabis industry. Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal laws.
 
A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice defines Schedule 1 controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the Federal Government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the Federal Government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us. While we do not intend to harvest, distribute or sell cannabis, we may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
As of the date of this report, there are 33 states and the District of Columbia allow their citizens to use Medical Marijuana. The District of Columbia and 10 states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington -- have adopted the most expansive laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Most recently, Michigan voters approved a ballot measure permitting adults age 21 and over to purchase and possess recreational-use marijuana. Vermont became the first state earlier this year to legalize marijuana for recreational use through the legislative process, rather than via a ballot measure. Vermont's law allows for adults age 21 and over to grow and possess small amounts of cannabis. However, it does not permit the sale of nonmedical cannabis. Some other state laws similarly decriminalized marijuana but did not initially legalize retail sales.

The state laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. If the federal government decides to enforce the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute, or growing marijuana could be subject to fines and imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws will cause significant financial damage to us.
 
Previously, the Obama administration took the position that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana. The Trump administration has revised this policy. Specifically, the Attorney General vacated the Cole Memorandum in favor of deferral of any enforcement of federal regulation to the individual states Department of Justice/US Attorney. However, certain other protections remain in place via budgetary element embedment (Rohrabacher-Farr amendment now referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment), which limits funding of any enforcement of anti-cannabis legislation. The Department of Justice has stated that it will continue to enforce the Controlled Substance Act with respect to marijuana to prevent:
 

· | the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels receiving revenue from the sale of marijuana;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | driving while impaired and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the growing of marijuana on public lands; and
--+----------------------------------------------


· | marijuana possession or use on federal property.
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
Since the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, federally chartered banks will not accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for our clients to operate. There does appears to be recent movement to allow state-chartered banks and credit unions to provide banking to the industry, but as of the date of this Report there are only nominal entities that have been formed that offer these services.
 
Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in many states, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plan and could expose us and our management to potential criminal liability and subject their properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent states from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. However, state laws do not supersede the prohibitions set forth in the federal drug laws.
 
For a comprehensive and up to date perspective on this process and current states and territories cannabis laws please refer to the following link: http://www.mpp.org/states/key-marijuana-policy-reform.html
 
In order to participate in either the medical or recreational sides of the marijuana industry in Colorado and elsewhere, all businesses and employees must obtain licenses from the state and, for businesses, local jurisdictions. Colorado issues four types of business licenses including cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, and testing. In addition, all owners and employees must obtain an occupational license to be permitted to own or work in a facility. All applicants for licenses undergo a background investigation, including a criminal record check for all owners and employees.

Colorado has also enacted stringent regulations governing the facilities and operations of marijuana businesses. All facilities are required to be licensed by the state and local authorities and are subject to comprehensive security and surveillance requirements. In addition, each facility is subject to extensive regulations that govern its businesses practices, which includes mandatory seed-to-sale tracking and reporting, health and sanitary standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and product testing for potency and contaminants.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations. Local, state and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on its business.
 
Canadian Regulations
 
Summary of the Cannabis Act
 
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into force as law with the effect of legalizing adult recreational use of cannabis across Canada. The Cannabis Act replaced the ACMPR and the IHR, both of which came into force under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada) (the “CDSA”), which previously permitted access to cannabis for medical purposes for only those Canadians who had been authorized to use cannabis by their health care practitioner. The ACMPR replaced the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (Canada) (the “MMPR”), which was implemented in June 2013. The MMPR replaced the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (Canada) (the “MMAR”) which was implemented in 2001. The MMPR and MMAR were initial steps in the Government of Canada’s legislative path towards the eventual legalization and regulating recreational and medical cannabis.
 
The Cannabis Act permits the recreational adult use of cannabis and regulates the production, distribution and sale of cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada, for both recreational and medical purposes. Under the Cannabis Act, Canadians who are authorized by their health care practitioner to use medical cannabis have the option of purchasing cannabis from one of the producers licensed by Health Canada and are also able to register with Health Canada to produce a limited amount of cannabis for their own medical purposes or to designate an individual who is registered with Health Canada to produce cannabis on their behalf for personal medical purposes.
 
Pursuant to the Cannabis Act, subject to provincial regulations, individuals over the age of 18 are be able to purchase fresh cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, and cannabis plants or seeds and are able to legally possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or the equivalent amount in fresh cannabis or cannabis oil. The Cannabis Act also permits households to grow a maximum of four cannabis plants. This limit applies regardless of the number of adults that reside in the household. In addition, the Cannabis Act provides provincial and municipal governments the authority to prescribe regulations regarding retail and distribution, as well as the ability to alter some of the existing baseline requirements of the Cannabis Act, such as increasing the minimum age for purchase and consumption.
 
Provincial and territorial governments in Canada have made varying announcements on the proposed regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for adult-use purposes. For example, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and the Northwest Territories have chosen the government-regulated model for distribution, whereas Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador have opted for a private sector approach. Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Nunavut and British Columbia have announced plans to pursue a hybrid approach of public and private sale and distribution.

In connection with the new framework for regulating cannabis in Canada, the Federal Government has introduced new penalties under the Criminal Code (Canada), including penalties for the illegal sale of cannabis, possession of cannabis over the prescribed limit, production of cannabis beyond personal cultivation limits, taking cannabis across the Canadian border, giving or selling cannabis to a youth and involving a youth to commit a cannabis-related offence.
 
On July 11, 2018, the Canadian Federal Government published regulations in the Canada Gazette to support the Cannabis Act, including the Cannabis Regulations, the new Industrial Hemp Regulations, along with proposed amendments to the Narcotic Control Regulations and certain regulations under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada). The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations, among other things, outline the rules for the legal cultivation, processing, research, analytical testing, distribution, sale, importation and exportation of cannabis and hemp in Canada, including the various classes of licenses that can be granted, and set standards for cannabis and hemp products. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations include strict specifications for the plain packaging and labelling and analytical testing of all cannabis products as well as stringent physical and personnel security requirements for all federally licensed production sites. The Industrial Hemp Regulations and the Cannabis Regulations also maintain a distinct system for access to cannabis. With the Cannabis Act now in force, cannabis has ceased to be regulated under the CDSA and is instead regulated under the Cannabis Act, and both the ACMPR and the IHR have been repealed effective October 17, 2018.
 
On June 7, 2018, Bill-C45 passed the third reading in the Senate with a number of amendments to the language of the Cannabis Act. More specifically, the Senate proposed:
 

· | establishing a committee of the Senate and a committee of the House of Commons to undertake a comprehensive review of the administration and operation of the Cannabis Act;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | assisting provinces and territories to facilitate the development of workplace impairment policies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | allowing provinces to place restrictions on the ability of individuals to engage in home cultivation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that law enforcement be provided with the appropriate tools and resources to address concerns about continued illicit production, diversion, and sale of cannabis to youth, including preventing the sharing of marihuana among young adults by rendering it a ticketable offense;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that the prices set for cannabis products and the applicable taxes reflect the dual objective of minimizing the health dangers of cannabis consumption and undercutting the illicit market of cannabis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | mandatory health warnings for cannabis products, including warnings about the danger of smoking cannabis, the danger of exposure to second-hand cannabis smoke, and the risks of combining cannabis and tobacco;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | testing procedures for THC content be standardized to ensure accurate measurement to better protect consumer health and safety;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | that forthcoming regulations for edible products and other forms of cannabis ensure that product packaging is child-resistant and does not appeal to young people, and that the type of available products should be strictly limited;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequate and ongoing funding for sustained, evidence-based cannabis education and prevention programs to provide Canadians, especially young Canadians, with knowledge about the health risks of cannabis use, including on-going research initiatives on the impact of cannabis use on the developing brain; and that the federal government commit to on-going educational initiatives to ensure youth are informed on the effects of cannabis use;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to prohibit licensees under the Cannabis Act to distribute branded merchandise, such as T-shirts and baseball caps and imposing a moratorium on loosening the regulations on the branding, marketing, and promotion of cannabis for 10 years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to set aggressive targets, comparable to the successful Federal Tobacco Control Strategy, to reduce the number of youth and adult cannabis users; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | to ensure that the Cannabis Tracking System be operational upon the coming-into-force of the Cannabis Act.

Security Clearances
 
The Cannabis Regulations require that certain people associated with cannabis licensees, including individuals occupying a “key position” directors, officers, large shareholders and individuals identified by the Minister of Health, must hold a valid security clearance issued by the Minister of Health. Officers and directors of a parent corporation must be security cleared.
 
Under the Cannabis Regulations, the Minister of Health may refuse to grant security clearances to individuals with associations to organized crime or with past convictions for, or an association with, drug trafficking, corruption or violent offences. Individuals who have histories of nonviolent, lower-risk criminal activity (for example, simple possession of cannabis, or small-scale cultivation of cannabis plants) are not precluded from participating in the legal cannabis industry, and the grant of security clearance to such individuals is at the discretion of the Minister of Health and such applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
 
Cannabis Tracking System
 
Under the Cannabis Act, the Minister of Health is authorized to establish and maintain a national cannabis tracking system. The Cannabis Regulations set out a national cannabis tracking system to track cannabis throughout the supply chain to help prevent diversion of cannabis into, and out of, the illicit market. The Cannabis Regulations also provides the Minister of Health with the authority to make a ministerial order that would require certain persons named in such order to report specific information about their authorized activities with cannabis, in the form and manner specified by the Minister of Health.
Cannabis Products
 
The Cannabis Regulations set out the requirements for the sale of cannabis products at the retail level permit the sale of dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, cannabis plants, and cannabis seeds, including in such forms as “pre-rolled” and in capsules. The THC content and serving size of cannabis products is limited by the Cannabis Regulations. The sale of edibles containing cannabis and cannabis concentrates was not initially permitted, however the federal government anticipates that such products will be legalized within one year following the coming into force of the Cannabis Act.
Employees
 
As of the date of this Report we employ 58 persons, including 4 executive officers, 9 in our cultivation equipment division, 8 in our warehouse, 10 in sales, 3 in finance, 4 in customer implementation, 3 in marketing, , 2 in corporate development 6 in technology 4 in environmental science and 5 new employees who were previously employed by Impact Engineering, who we acquired subsequent to December 31, 2018. See “Growth by Acquisition – Subsequent Event” above. We also utilize the services of three independent contractors focused on business development, and a revolving number of referral agents.
 
Our employees work at will and are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent. We require all our employees and consultants to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Our success relies on our ability to hire additional employees, particularly on the sales side in markets around the world. We believe there are numerous high quality people to choose from throughout our area of operations.
