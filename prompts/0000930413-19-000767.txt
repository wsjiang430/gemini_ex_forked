ITEM 1. BUSINESS
----------------

Our Businesses
 
 First Horizon National Corporation (“FHN,” “First Horizon,” the “Corporation,” “we,” or “us”) is a Tennessee corporation. We incorporated in 1968 and are headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, and are a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. At December 31, 2018, we had total consolidated assets of $40.8 billion.
 
We provide diversified financial services primarily through our principal subsidiary, First Tennessee Bank National Association (the “Bank,” “FTB,” or “FTBNA”). The Bank is a national banking association with principal offices in Memphis, Tennessee. The Bank and its subsidiaries conduct the Bank’s traditional banking businesses principally under the First Tennessee Bank and Capital Bank brands, its wealth management business principally under the FTB Advisors brand, and its fixed income businesses principally under the FTN Financial brand. The Bank received its charter in 1864, and has a number of operating subsidiaries and divisions.

 During 2018 approximately 37% of our consolidated revenues were provided by fee and other noninterest income and approximately 63% of revenues were provided by net interest income.
 
As a financial holding company, we coordinate the financial resources of the consolidated enterprise and maintain systems of financial, operational, and administrative control intended to coordinate selected policies and activities, including as described in Item 9A of Part II.
 
Business Segments
 
Our financial results of operations are reported through operational business segments which are not closely related to the legal structure of our subsidiaries. We operate through four business segments: regional banking, fixed income, corporate, and non-strategic. We sometimes refer to regional banking, fixed income, and corporate as our “core” business segments.
 
Financial and other additional information concerning our segments—including information concerning

 assets, revenues, and financial results—appears in the response to Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders.
 
The Bank
 
During 2018 through its various business lines, including consolidated subsidiaries, the Bank generated gross revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) of approximately $2.3 billion and generated a substantial majority of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $40.6 billion in total assets, $33.0 billion in total deposits, and $27.7 billion in total loans (net of unearned income). Among Tennessee headquartered banks, the Bank ranked 1st in Tennessee deposit market share at June 30, 2018 based on FDIC data.
 
Physical Business Locations
 
At December 31, 2018, FHN’s subsidiaries had over 300 business locations in 20 U.S. states, excluding off-premises ATMs. Almost all of those locations were bank branches and FTN Financial offices.
 
At December 31, 2018, the Bank had 297 First Tennessee Bank and Capital Bank branches in eight states:

Information about the net interest income and noninterest income we obtained from our largest categories of products and services appears under the caption “Income Statement Review—2018 Compared to 2017; 2017 Compared to 2016” beginning on page 8 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders, which information is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.
 
Loans & Deposits
 
Our largest asset is our loan portfolio, if all of our loans are viewed collectively, and lending is a critical, core business for us. Similarly, our largest resource is our deposit base, and deposit-taking also is a critical, core business. at year-end 2018, we had total net loans of $27.4 billion and total deposits of $32.7 billion. Most of our loans and deposits are held in our regional banking segment. The following tables provide an overview of our loan and deposit balances at December 31, 2018 or averaged over the year 2018.
 
Geographically, over half of our loans originate from Tennessee and North Carolina, with no other state accounting for 10%. Nearly three-fourths of our deposits are associated with Tennessee.

Only about one fourth of our loans, but over 40% of our deposits, are with consumers.

Consumer | 26% | | Consumer Interest | 41%

* | Averages for 2018.
--+-------------------

 
In practical effect, these tables show that our lending outside of Tennessee is funded significantly by deposits from our Tennessee markets, and a significant portion of funding for our commercial lending comes from consumer deposits. Keeping our funding uses and sources in balance is a critical function for us. Excess deposits most typically are invested in investments permitted by our regulators, while excess lending most typically is funded with borrowing. Because loans and deposits fluctuate constantly, we maintain access to significant non-deposit liquidity sources, primarily short-term borrowing.
 
Most of our commercial loans are traditional, unsecured “commercial, financial, and industrial,” or “C&I,” loans, and most of the rest are secured “commercial real estate,” or “CRE,” loans. Within C&I, nearly 30% of loans are to businesses in the financial services industry, including mortgage lending companies, and the rest are in a wide range of industries.

 Commercial Loans by Line of Business
 

All Commercial Loans* | | All C&I Loans* 
--------------------------+-----+-------------------
C&I | 80% | | Finance & Insur. | 17%
CRE | 20% | | Mortg. Lenders | 12%
 | | | Real estate rental | 9% 
 | | | Health care | 8% 
 | | | Manufacturing | 8% 
 | | | Hospitality | 7% 
 | | | Wholesale trade | 7% 
 | | | Public Admin. | 5% 
 | | | Retail trade | 5% 
 | | | Other C&I | 22%


* | At December 31, 2018.
--+----------------------

 
The C&I portfolio was $16.5 billion on December 31, 2018, and is comprised of loans used for general business purposes. Typical products include working capital lines of credit, term loan financing of owner-occupied real estate and fixed assets, and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit. The largest geographical concentrations of C&I balances as of December 31, 2018, are in Tennessee (36%), North Carolina (11%), Texas (6%), Florida (6%), California (6%), Georgia (4%), and South Carolina (4%), with no other state representing more than 3% of the C&I portfolio.
 
Further information regarding our loans is provided in Note 4 to the financial statements appearing in our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders, and under the captions “Statement of Condition Review—2018 Compared to 2017” beginning on page 19, and “Asset Quality—Trend Analysis of 2018 compared to 2017” beginning on page 28, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which disclosures are incorporated into this Item 1 by reference.


Recent Significant Business Developments
 
 Over the past five years, key strategic priorities for us have included:
 

· | targeted expansion of consumer and commercial banking products and markets
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | opportunistic expansion of commercial lending, mainly through acquisition transactions, talent development, and talent acquisitions
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | vigorous discipline in controlling expenses not closely related to revenue production
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | managing our business units and products with a strong emphasis on risk-adjusted returns on invested capital
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | robust emphasis on providing exceptional customer service as a primary means to differentiate us from competitors
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | investment in scalable technology and other infrastructure to attract and retain business, and to support expansion.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect that these will continue to be areas of strong focus for many years to come. Examples of our implementation of these priorities include:
 

· | In 2018 we integrated the systems, marketing, and other critical functions of our legacy $30 billion First Tennessee Bank operation and our newly-acquired $10 billion Capital Bank operation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other bank acquisitions include branches in several smaller Tennessee markets (2014), TrustAtlantic Bank (2015), and a restaurant franchise finance business and portfolio (2016). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have made key talent hires in critical areas throughout our company, with the main focus on organically growing economically profitable business lines inside and outside our traditional markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We have pruned our physical network to reflect long-term trends in customer usage of physical branches, and correspondingly are making more efficient use of other physical facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organic and acquisitive loan growth in regional banking has more than offset loan attrition from the non-strategic segment, where legacy loan portfolios are in long-term wind-down.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organic commercial loan growth has been strong in specialty lending areas, such as lending to mortgage companies, where margins tend to be better but volatility tends to be higher.

Key Factors
 
Although many factors had impacts isolated to one year or another, several factors complicate comparisons among the past five years. Key among those are:
 

· | Capital Bank. Many financial condition figures increased substantially in 2017 due to the Capital Bank transaction, while our financial results were less noticeably impacted until 2018. Because that transaction closed late in 2017, Capital’s assets and liabilities are reflected in 2017 year-end financial condition data. Earnings from Capital’s loans and other operations were included in our financial results for all of 2018 but only the final month of 2017, and not at all in earlier years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tax Reform. Corporate tax reform in December, 2017 resulted in significant negative adjustments within tax provision, driving a large net loss in fourth quarter that year. Financial results in 2018, in contrast, benefited significantly from lower tax rates compared to earlier years.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interest Rate Policy. Although interest rates during each of these years were quite low by historical standards, they were raised modestly starting in 2015 and more vigorously during 2018. This increased net interest income beyond simple loan growth. That impact began to moderate in 2018 as deposit rates, which tend to lag, began to catch up.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sale of Visa Class B Stock. In 2018 we sold our legacy stock holdings of Visa, recognizing a pretax gain of $212.9 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trends
 
Noteworthy trends during this period include:
 

· | Net loan growth has driven asset growth. Overall growth has been strong despite run-off of non-strategic loans. The large increase in 2017 was driven by the Capital Bank merger.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growth in net interest income was positive overall, driven largely by net loan growth. The upticks in 2016 and 2017 were helped by modest interest rate increases beginning in late 2015. The large increase in 2018 was driven by the Capital Bank merger coupled with additional rate increases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The overall down-trend in noninterest income has been due mainly to lower fixed income revenues, driven by challenging market conditions including a flattening yield curve and low market volatility. The large increase in 2018 was mainly due to the Visa stock sale. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our loan loss provision expense has been quite low during the entire five years.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mortgage repurchase and litigation expenses and reserve releases, mostly related to legacy businesses in our non-strategic segment, have been idiosyncratic.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deposits have grown significantly and steadily. Much of that growth has been organic, though 2017’s large uptick was driven substantially by the Capital Bank transaction.

Exited Businesses
 
Since the 2008-09 recession we have focused on traditional banking and fixed income products and services. We exited our legacy nation-wide mortgage

 banking business in 2008, though we continue to manage related legal exposures and the wind-down of a still-sizable loan portfolio. We partially or fully exited other businesses since 2008. Exited businesses are managed in our non-strategic segment.
Other General Information
 
 Strategic Transactions
 
An element of our business strategy is to consider acquisitions and divestitures that would enhance long-term shareholder value. Significant acquisitions and divestitures which closed during the past three years are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2018 Annual Report to shareholders, which information is incorporated into this Item 1 by this reference.
 
In November 2017 we legally closed our acquisition of Capital Bank, as mentioned above. In May 2018 we completed systems integration for that transaction.
 
Subsidiaries
 
FHN’s consolidated operating subsidiaries at December 31, 2018 are listed in Exhibit 21.
 
The Bank has filed notice with the OCC as a government securities broker/dealer. The FTN Financial division of the Bank is registered with the SEC as a municipal securities dealer and the FTN Financial Municipal Advisors division of the Bank is registered with the SEC as a municipal adviser. The Bank is supervised and regulated as described in “Supervision and Regulation” in this Item below.
 
Martin and Company, Inc., FTB Advisors, Inc., and FTN Financial Main Street Advisors, LLC are registered with the SEC as investment advisers. FTB Advisors, Inc. and FTN Financial Securities Corp. are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and all states where they conduct business for which registration is required. FTB Advisors Insurance Services, Inc., First Horizon Insurance Services, Inc., and First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. are licensed as insurance agencies in all states where they do business for which licensing is required. FTN Financial Securities Corp., First Horizon Insurance Services, Inc., FTB Advisors Insurance Services, Inc., and First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. are financial subsidiaries under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. FTB Advisors, Inc. is licensed as an insurance agency in the states where it does business for which licensing is required for the sale of annuity products. First Horizon Insurance Agency, Inc. is inactive.

 Customer Concentration
 
Neither we nor any of our significant subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not experience material seasonality. We do experience seasonal variation in certain revenues, expenses, and credit trends. Historically, these variations have somewhat increased certain expenses for the regional banking and fixed income segments, and somewhat diminished certain revenues for the regional banking segment, principally in the first quarter each year. In addition, we experience seasonal variation in certain asset and liability balances, principally in the fourth (commercial lending related to consumer mortgages, certain trading balances, and certain employee-related reserves) and first (mortgage-related lending) quarters.
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, FHN and its subsidiaries had 5,577 employees, or 5,576 full-time-equivalent employees, not including contract labor for certain services.

Supervision and Regulation
 
 Scope of this Summary
 
This section describes certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank and financial holding companies and their subsidiaries, and to companies engaged in securities and insurance activities. It also provides certain specific information about us. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business.
Overview
 
FHN is a bank holding company and financial holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), and is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve” or “Federal Reserve Board”). We are subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require pursuant to the BHCA.
 
A bank holding company that is not a financial holding company generally cannot directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Also, such a bank holding company and its subsidiaries generally are limited to engaging in banking and activities found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking.
 
Eligible bank holding companies that elect to become financial holding companies may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in activities that are “financial in nature,” generally without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. “Financial” activities are much broader in scope than those which are “closely related to banking.” See “Financial Activities other than Banking” beginning on page 12 below.
 
The Federal Reserve may approve an application by a bank holding company to acquire a bank located outside the acquirer’s principal state of operations without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited

 under state law, although state law may still impose certain requirements. See “Interstate Banking and Branching” beginning on page 11 below.
 
The Tennessee Bank Structure Act of 1974, among other things, prohibits (subject to certain exceptions) a bank holding company from acquiring a bank for which the home state is Tennessee (a “Tennessee bank”) if, upon consummation, the company would directly or indirectly control 30% or more of the total deposits in insured depository institutions in Tennessee. As of June 30, 2018, we estimate that we held approximately 15.51% of such deposits.
 
Our Bank is a national banking association subject to the regulation and supervision of, and to examination by, the OCC as its primary federal regulator. The Bank is insured by, and subject to regulation by, the FDIC and is subject to regulation in certain respects by the CFPB. The Bank is also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, limitations on the types of investments that may be made, activities that may be engaged in, and types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and regulations also affect the operations of the Bank. In addition, the FTN Financial Municipal Advisors division of the Bank is registered with the SEC as a municipal advisor.
 
In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve as it attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in order to influence the economy. Also, the Bank and certain of its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with extensions of credit, leases or sales of property, or furnishing products or services.
 
The regulatory framework governing banks and the financial industry is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, not for the protection of our Bank or our security holders.

Regulatory Tiers Based on Asset Size
 
Many critical regulatory topics are divided into tiers based largely or entirely on asset size. Different topics have different cut-off points for the tiers. Within each topic, different rules apply to the different tiers.
 
Cut-off points vary significantly. However, as a rough generalization, for many regulatory topics the critical cut-off points are $10 billion and $250 billion. Companies with less than $10 billion are less regulated in several important ways than we are, and companies with $250 billion or more are regulated much more severely in many important ways than we are. As a result, under current law compliance costs and restrictions grow with size, they tend to change abruptly as a company crosses to the next tier, and we are in the middle tier in many respects.
 
The remainder of this “Supervision and Regulation” discussion focuses on current rules which apply to FHN based on our current asset size.
 
Payment of Dividends
 
FHN is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries. FHN’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on its stock or to pay principal (including premium, if any) and interest on debt securities, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to FHN, as well as by FHN to its shareholders.
 
As a national bank, our Bank must obtain the prior approval of the OCC to pay cash dividends if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank’s board of directors in any year exceeds the total of (i) its net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for that year plus (ii) the retained net profits (as defined and interpreted by regulation) for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The Bank also can pay dividends only to the extent that retained net profits (including the portion transferred to surplus) exceed bad debts (as defined by regulation).
 
If, in the opinion of an applicable federal bank regulatory agency, a depository institution (such as the Bank) or a holding company (such as FHN) is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the depository institution or holding company, could include the payment of dividends), that agency may require the institution or holding company to cease and desist from that practice. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s or holding company’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

 In addition, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDIA”), an FDIC-insured depository institution may not make any capital distributions, pay any management fees to its holding company, or pay any dividend if it is undercapitalized or if such payment would cause it to become undercapitalized.
 
Applying the applicable regulatory rules, at January 1, 2019, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank’s common or preferred stock of approximately $156.2 million without obtaining regulatory approval. That amount will improve during 2019 only to the extent that the Bank’s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year. The application of those restrictions to the Bank is discussed in more detail in the following sections, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1 by reference: under the caption “Liquidity Risk Management” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section beginning on page 54 of our 2018 Annual Report to shareholders; and under the caption “Restrictions on dividends” in Note 12—Regulatory Capital and Restrictions beginning on page 123 which is part of the material from our 2018 Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Items 7 and 8 of this report.
 
Under Tennessee law, FHN is not permitted to pay cash dividends if, after giving effect to such payment, FHN would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or its total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus any amounts needed to satisfy any preferential rights if we were dissolving. In addition, in deciding whether or not to declare a dividend of any particular size, our Board must consider our current and prospective capital, liquidity, and other needs, including the needs of the Bank which FHN is obligated to support.
 
The payment of cash dividends by FHN and the Bank also may be affected or limited by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and debt covenants. For example, as discussed under “Capital Adequacy” starting on page 9, FHN’s ability to pay dividends would be restricted if its capital ratios fell below minimum regulatory requirements plus a capital conservation buffer. The Federal Reserve and OCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising, among other


8
-

 things, that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
 
Transactions with Affiliates
 
The Bank’s ability to lend or extend credit to FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries (including for purposes of this paragraph, in certain situations, subsidiaries of the Bank) is restricted. The Bank and its subsidiaries generally may not extend credit to FHN or to any other affiliate in an amount which exceeds 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus and may not extend credit in the aggregate to all such affiliates in an amount which exceeds 20% of its capital stock and surplus. Extensions of credit and other transactions between the Bank and FHN or such other affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the Bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. Further, the type, amount, and quality of collateral which must secure such extensions of credit is regulated.
 
There are similar legal restrictions on: the Bank’s purchases of or investments in the securities of and purchases of assets from FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; the Bank’s loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; the issuance of guaranties, acceptances, and letters of credit on behalf of FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries; and certain bank transactions with FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries, or with respect to which FHN and its nonbank subsidiaries act as agent, participate, or have a financial interest.
 
Capital Adequacy
 
U.S. financial industry regulators have long required that regulated institutions maintain minimum capital levels. Following an extended reform effort, enhancements to the capital rules were adopted in 2013 based on international standards known as “Basel III.” For FHN the Basel III rules became effective in 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain subjects. The current standards require the following:

· | Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets (“Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio”) must be at least 4.5%. To be “well capitalized” the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 6.5%. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital consists of core components of Tier 1 Capital. The core components consist of common stock plus retained earnings net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2018, FHN’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 9.77% and the Bank’s was 9.81%.

· | Tier 1 Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 6%. To be “well capitalized” the Tier 1 Capital ratio must be at least 8%. Tier 1 Capital consists of the Tier 1 core components discussed in the bulleted paragraph immediately above, plus non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, net of goodwill, other intangible assets, and certain other required deduction items. At December 31, 2018, FHN’s Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 10.80% and the Bank’s was 10.72%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Total Capital Ratio. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN and the Bank, the ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets must be at least 8%. To be “well capitalized” the Total Capital ratios must be at least 10%. At December 31, 2018, FHN’s Total Capital Ratio was 11.94% and the Bank’s was 11.32%.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Capital Conservation Buffer. If a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% above the minimum required Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio, Tier 1 Capital ratio, and Total Capital ratio is not maintained, special restrictions would apply to capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, and on certain compensatory bonuses. The capital conservation buffer requirement has been subject to a four-year phase-in period beginning for FHN in 2016 at 0.625%, and increasing by that amount each year until 2.5% was reached in 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage Ratio—Base. For all supervised financial institutions, including FHN or the Bank, the Leverage ratio must be at least 4%. To be “well capitalized” the Leverage ratio must be at least 5%. The Leverage ratio is Tier 1 Capital divided by quarterly average assets net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain required

 deduction items. At December 31, 2018, FHN’s Leverage ratio was 9.09% and the Bank’s was 9.10%.
 

· | Leverage Ratio—Supplemental. For the largest internationally active supervised financial institutions, not including FHN or the Bank, a minimum supplementary Leverage ratio must be maintained that takes into account certain off-balance sheet exposures. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
FHN believes that both FHN and the Bank were in compliance with applicable minimum capital requirements as of December 31, 2018.
 
The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the OCC incorporated market and interest-rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. Those standards explicitly identify concentration of credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional activities, and the management of such risks, as important qualitative factors to consider in assessing an institution’s overall capital adequacy.
 
U.S. regulators’ market risk rules are applicable to covered institutions—those with aggregate trading assets and trading liabilities of at least 10% of their total assets or at least $1 billion. FHN and the Bank are covered institutions under the rule. The rules specify the methodology for calculating the amount of risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and include, among other things, the addition of a component for stressed value at risk. The rule eliminates the use of

 credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. Alternative standards of creditworthiness are used for specific standardized risks, such as exposures to sovereign debt, public sector entities, other banking institutions, corporate debt, and securitizations. In addition, an 8% capital surcharge applies to certain covered institutions, not including FHN or the Bank.
 
Moreover, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it considers a “Tangible Tier 1 Capital Leverage Ratio” (deducting all intangibles) and other indicia of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.
 
Failure to meet capital guidelines could subject a bank to a variety of enforcement remedies, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on its business and in certain circumstances to the appointment of a conservator or receiver. See “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” immediately below in this report for additional information.
 
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)
 
Federal banking regulators must take “prompt corrective action” regarding FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, insured depository institutions are divided into five capital categories. The specific requirements applicable to us are summarized in the table below.
REQUIREMENTS FOR PCA CAPITALIZATION CATEGORIES
 

Well capitalized | • Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6.5% • Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 8% • Total Capital ratio of at least 10% • Leverage ratio of at least 5% • Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels 
-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adequately capitalized | • Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4.5% • Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6% • Total Capital ratio of at least 8% • Leverage ratio of at least 4% • Not subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels 
Undercapitalized | Failure to maintain any requirement to be adequately capitalized 
Significantly Undercapitalized | Failure to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 3%, Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 4%, Total Capital ratio of at least 6%, or a Leverage ratio of at least 3% 
Critically Undercapitalized | Failure to maintain a level of tangible equity equal to at least 2% of total assets 


10
--

 At December 31, 2018, the Bank had sufficient capital to qualify as “well capitalized” under the regulatory capital requirements discussed above. An institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Institutions generally are not allowed to publicly disclose examination results.
 
An FDIC-insured depository institution generally is prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve System. In addition, undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans. An insured depository institution’s holding company must guarantee the capital plan, up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the depository institution’s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan, for the plan to be accepted by the applicable federal regulatory authority. The federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.
 
Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
 
Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator, generally within 90 days of the date on which they become critically undercapitalized.
 
Holding Company Structure and Support of Subsidiary Banks
 
Because FHN is a holding company, its right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter’s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including depositors in the case of the Bank) except to the extent that FHN may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, depositors of a bank, and the FDIC as their subrogee, would be entitled to priority over the creditors in the event of liquidation of a bank subsidiary.

 Under Federal Reserve policy FHN is expected to act as a source of financial strength to, and to commit resources to support, the Bank. This support may be required at times even though, absent such Federal Reserve policy, FHN might not wish to provide it. In addition, any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
 
Cross-Guarantee Liability
 
A depository institution insured by the FDIC can be held liable for any loss incurred by, or reasonably expected to be incurred by, the FDIC in connection with (i) the default of a commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution or (ii) any assistance provided by the FDIC to any commonly controlled FDIC-insured depository institution “in danger of default.” “Default” is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or receiver and “in danger of default” is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance. The FDIC’s claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors, and holders of subordinated debt (other than affiliates) of the commonly controlled insured depository institution.
 
Currently the Bank is the only depository institution owned by FHN. If FHN were to operate another depository institution, any loss suffered by the FDIC in respect of one subsidiary bank would likely result in assertion of the cross-guarantee provisions, the assessment of such estimated losses against FHN’s other subsidiary bank(s), and a potential loss of FHN’s investment in its subsidiary banks.
 
Interstate Banking and Branching
 
Federal law allows a national bank to establish and operate a de novo branch in a state other than the bank’s home state if the law of the state where the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were chartered by that state, subject to standard regulatory review and approval requirements. Federal law also allows a national bank to acquire an existing branch in a state in which the bank is not headquartered and does not maintain a branch if the OCC approves the branch or acquisition, and if the law of the state in which the branch is located or to be located would permit the establishment

11
--

 of the branch if the bank were chartered by that state. Additionally, for an interstate merger or acquisition: the acquiring bank must be well-capitalized and well-managed; concentration limits on liabilities and deposits may not be exceeded; and regulators must assess the transaction for incremental systemic risk.
 
Once a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction or through de novo branching, the bank may then establish and acquire additional branches within that state to the same extent that a state chartered bank is allowed to establish or acquire branches within the state. 
 
Financial Activities other than Banking
 
Federal law generally allows bank holding companies such as FHN broad authority to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity. These include: insurance underwriting and brokerage; merchant banking; securities underwriting, dealing, and market-making; real estate development; and such additional activities as the Federal Reserve in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental. A bank holding company may engage in these activities directly or through subsidiaries by qualifying as a “financial holding company.” To qualify, a bank holding company must file an initial declaration with the Federal Reserve, certifying that all of its subsidiary depository institutions are well-managed and well-capitalized. Federal law also permits national banks such as the Bank to engage in certain of these activities through financial subsidiaries. To control or hold an interest in a financial subsidiary, a national bank must meet the following requirements:
 

(1) | The bank must receive approval from the OCC for the financial subsidiary to engage in the activities. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The bank and its depository institution affiliates must each be well-capitalized and well-managed. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The aggregate consolidated total assets of all of the bank’s financial subsidiaries must not exceed the lesser of: 45% of the bank’s consolidated total assets; or $50 billion (subject to indexing for inflation). 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | The bank must have in place adequate policies and procedures to identify and manage financial and operational risks and to preserve the separate identities and limited liability of the bank and the financial subsidiary. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | If the financial subsidiary will engage in principal transactions and the bank is one of the one hundred largest banks, the bank must have outstanding at least one issue of unsecured long-term debt that meets creditworthiness standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Secretary of the Treasury from time to time. If this fifth requirement ceases to be met after a bank controls or holds an interest in a financial subsidiary, the bank cannot invest additional capital in that subsidiary until the requirement again is met.
 
No new financial activity may be commenced unless the national bank and all of its depository institution affiliates have at least “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act ratings. Certain restrictions apply if the bank holding company or the national bank fails to continue to meet one or more of the requirements listed above.
 
In addition, federal law contains a number of other provisions that may affect the Bank’s operations, including limitations on the use and disclosure to third parties of customer information.
 
At December 31, 2018, FHN is a financial holding company and the Bank has a number of financial subsidiaries, as discussed in “Other General Information” beginning on page 6 of this report.
 
Interchange Fee Restrictions
 
Regulations under the so-called Durbin Amendment severely cap interchange fees which the Bank may charge merchants for debit card transactions. The Durbin Amendment is a provision of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Reform Act,” the “Dodd-Frank Act,” or “Dodd-Frank”).
Volcker Rule
 
The so-called Volcker rule (1) prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading, which is engaging as principal in any purchase or sale of one or more of certain types of financial instruments, and (2) limits banking entities’ ability to invest in or sponsor hedge funds or private equity funds.  In 2018, the federal agencies responsible for implementing the Volcker Rule proposed significant changes to the rule, but no final rule has yet been adopted.
 
Consumer Regulation by the CFPB
 
The CFPB adopts and administers significant rules affecting consumer lending and consumer financial services. Key rules for the Bank include detailed regulation of mortgage servicing practices and detailed regulation of mortgage origination and underwriting practices. The latter rules, among other things, establish the definition of a “qualified mortgage” using traditional underwriting practices involving down payments, credit history, income levels and verification, and so forth. The rules do not prohibit, but do tend to discourage, lenders from originating non-qualified mortgages.


12
--

 The CFPB has been active bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws, in many cases obtaining significant settlement outcomes. Enforcement theories advanced by the CFPB sometimes have gone beyond the industry’s interpretation of the applicable regulations; that practice generally increases our compliance risk.
 
Data Privacy & Security
 
Federal law restricts the Bank’s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. Federal law also requires banks to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards.
 
FDIC Insurance Assessments; DIFA
 
U.S. bank deposits generally are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The system of FDIC insurance premium rates charged consists of a rate grid structure in which base rates range from 5 to 35 basis points annually, and fully adjusted rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points annually. Key factors in the grid include: the institution’s risk category (I to IV); whether the institution is deemed large and highly complex; whether the institution qualifies for an unsecured debt adjustment; and whether the institution is burdened with a brokered deposit adjustment. Other factors can impact the base against which the applicable rate is applied, including (for example) whether a net loss is realized. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by a federal bank regulatory agency.
 
Depositor Preference
 
Federal law provides that deposits and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including federal funds and letters of credit, in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver.
Securities Regulation
 
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various securities laws and regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate.

 Our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the SEC’s net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1. That rule requires the maintenance of minimum net capital and limits the ability of the broker-dealer to transfer large amounts of capital to a parent company or affiliate. Compliance with the rule could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading.
 
Certain of our subsidiaries are registered investment advisers which are regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Advisory contracts with clients automatically terminate under these laws upon an assignment of the contract by the investment adviser unless appropriate consents are obtained.
 
Insurance Activities
 
Certain subsidiaries sell various types of insurance as agent in a number of states. Insurance activities are subject to regulation by the states in which such business is transacted. Although most of such regulation focuses on insurance companies and their insurance products, insurance agents and their activities are also subject to regulation by the states, including, among other things, licensing and marketing and sales practices.
Compensation and Risk Management
 
The Federal Reserve, OCC, and other agencies have issued guidance intended to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at financial organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance is based on three “key principles” calling for incentive compensation plans to: appropriately balance risks and rewards; be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and be backed up by strong corporate governance. In response: we operate an enhanced risk management process for assessing risk in incentive compensation plans; several key incentive programs use a net profit approach rather than a revenues-only approach; and mandatory deferral features are used in several key programs, including an executive program.
 
In 2016 federal agencies proposed regulations which might significantly change the regulation of incentive compensation programs at financial institutions. The proposal would create four tiers of institutions based on asset size. Institutions in the top two tiers (over $50 billion) would be subject to rules much more detailed and proscriptive than are currently in effect. If interpreted aggressively by the regulators, the rules could be used to prevent, as a practical matter, larger institutions from engaging in certain lines of business where substantial commission and bonus pool arrangements are the norm. FHN and the Bank currently would fall into the third tier, where the impact of the proposed rules is substantially more modest. The rules have not been finalized nor withdrawn. FHN cannot predict what final rules may be adopted, nor how they will be implemented.

Effect of Governmental Policies
 
 The Bank is affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the CFPB. The Federal Reserve’s mandate from Congress is to pursue price stability and full employment. In these pursuits, the Federal Reserve sets and manages monetary policy for the U.S.
 
Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve are: purchases and sales of U.S. government and other securities in the marketplace; changes in the discount rate, which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the Federal Reserve; changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions; changes in the rate paid on banks’ required and excess reserve deposits at the Federal Reserve; and changes in the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which depository institutions lend

 balances to each other overnight. These instruments are intended to influence economic and monetary growth, interest rate levels, and inflation.
 
The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Because of changing conditions in the national and international economies and in the money markets, as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand, or the business and results of operations of FHN and the Bank, or whether changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings.


Other Proposals
 
 Bills occasionally are introduced in the United States Congress and the Tennessee General Assembly and other state legislatures, and regulations occasionally are proposed by our regulatory agencies, any of which could affect our businesses, financial results, and financial condition.

 We are not able to predict what, if any, changes that Congress, state legislatures, or the regulatory agencies will enact or implement in the future, nor the impact that those actions will have upon us.


Competition
 
 In all aspects of the businesses in which we engage we face substantial competition from banks doing business in our markets as well as from savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other firms offering financial products or services.
Regional Banking
 
Our regional banking business primarily competes in several areas within the southeast U.S. where we have branch locations. However, competition in our industry is trending away from the traditional geographic footprint model. That trend is happening throughout the industry, but the rate of change is highly uneven

 among different types of customers, products, and services.
 
Our regional banking business serves both consumer and commercial customers. The consumer business remains strongly linked to our physical branch locations, even as our delivery of financial services to consumers becomes increasingly focused on popular non-branch delivery methods, such as online and mobile banking. Online and mobile banking have contributed to a decline in branch usage, but not (so far) an erosion of the link between branch versus consumer customer location. Increasingly, however, consumers are able to manage their funds and financial affairs at multiple financial institutions through only one of them. If cross-institutional management features become popular, they may hasten a de-linking of consumers to traditional branch networks.


14
--

 The commercial business also has a geographic linkage, but it is weaker. Some areas of our commercial banking business, particularly in specialty lending, are broadly regional or even national in scope rather than being heavily centered on branch locations.
 
Key traditional competitors in many of our markets include Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Bank of America N.A., SunTrust Bank, and Regions Bank, among many others including many community banks and credit unions. An additional key competitor in Tennessee is Pinnacle National Bank. Additional key competitors in the Carolinas are Branch Banking and Trust Company (BB&T) and First-Citizens Bank & Trust Company (First Citizens Bank). Additional key competitors in south Florida are JPMorgan Chase Bank National Association, PNC Bank National Association, BankUnited, and Florida Community Bank N.A.
 
A number of recent technologies created or operated by non-banks have been integrated into the financial systems used by traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of incrementally evolutionary technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks. Prior methods of delivering those services were disrupted, but often at a pace which all but the weakest banks could accommodate.
 
Recently, some evolutionary pressures have arisen which may prove to be less incremental and more disruptive. For example, in financial planning and wealth management, companies that are not traditional banks, including both long-established firms (such as Vanguard) and new ones (such as Betterment), have developed highly-interactive systems and applications. These services compete directly with traditional banks in offering personal financial advice. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these “robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers. We and other

 traditional banks have begun to offer similar services, but in doing so risk cannibalizing traditional business models for these services.
 
In recent years, certain financial companies or their affiliates that traditionally were not banks have been able to compete more directly with the Bank for deposits and other traditional banking services and products. Increased fluidity across traditional boundaries is likely to continue. Non-traditional companies competing with us for traditional banking products and services include investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance company affiliates, peer-to-peer lending arrangers, non-bank deposit acceptors, companies offering payment facilitation services (such as PayPal and pre-paid debit card issuers), and extremely short-term consumer loan companies.
 
Fixed Income
 
Our fixed income business serves institutional customers, broadly segregated into depositories (including banks, thrifts, and credit unions) and non-depositories (including money managers, insurance companies, governmental units and agencies, public funds, pension funds, and hedge funds). Both customer segments are widely dispersed geographically, predominantly within the U.S. We have many competitors within both segments including major U.S. and international securities firms as well as numerous regional and local firms.
Additional Information
 
For additional information on the competitive position of FHN and the Bank, refer to the “General” subsection above of this Item 1. Also, refer to the subsections entitled “Supervision and Regulation” and “Effect of Governmental Policies,” both of which are relevant to an analysis of our competitors. Due to the intense competition in the financial services industry we can make no representation that our competitive position has or will remain constant, nor can we predict how it may change in the future.
