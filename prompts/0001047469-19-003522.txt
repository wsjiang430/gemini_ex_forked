   Recent Developments 
   ClearAg, Inc. 
         In April 2017, Iteris, Inc. formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, ClearAg, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to provide ClearAg solutions to the agriculture markets. 
   Products and Services 
         We currently operate in three reporting segments: Roadway Sensors, Transportation Systems, and Agriculture and Weather Analytics. 
         The Roadway Sensors segment provides various advanced detection sensors and systems for traffic intersection management, communication systems and roadway traffic data collection applications. The Transportation Systems segment provides traffic engineering and consulting services, as well as 
 4

   performance measurement, traffic analytics, traveler information and commercial vehicle operating software solutions. The Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment includes ClearPath Weather, our road maintenance applications, and ClearAg, our digital agriculture platform. 
         See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our reporting segments. 
 


Roadway Sensors 

         Our Roadway Sensors products include, among others, Vantage, VantageLive!, Vantage Next®, VantagePegasus, VantageRadius, Vantage Vector, Velocity, SmartCycle, SmartCycle Bike Indicator, SmartSpan, VersiCam, PedTrax and P-Series products. 
 

 Our Vantage detection systems detect vehicle presence at intersections, as well as vehicle count, speed and other traffic data used in traffic
management systems. Vantage detection systems typically include up to four of our advanced cameras or radar devices. Our Vantage systems give traffic managers the tools to mitigate roadway congestion
by visualizing and analyzing traffic patterns allowing them to modify traffic signal timing to improve traffic flow. Our various software components complement our Vantage detection systems by
providing integrated platforms to manage and view detection assets remotely over a network connection, as well as mobile application for viewing anywhere. 
 Our Vantage Vector video/radar hybrid product is an all-in-one detection sensor with a wide range of capabilities, including stop bar and
advanced zone detection, which enable advanced safety and adaptive control applications. Vantage Vector includes all of the benefits of Iteris video detection, including high accuracy,
high-availability remote viewing of video images, bicycle and pedestrian detection capability, and dilemma-zone detection. 
 VantageLive! is a cloud-based platform that allows users to collect, process and analyze advanced intersection data, as well as to view and
understand intersection activity. 
 All of our Vantage systems are available with SmartCycle capability, which can effectively differentiate between bicycles and other vehicles
with a single video detection camera, enabling more efficient signalized intersections, improved traffic throughput and increased bicyclist safety. Agencies using bicycle timing can now benefit from
bicycle-specific virtual detection zones that can be placed anywhere within the approaching traffic lanes, eliminating the need for separate bicycle-only detection systems. 
 The SmartCycle Bike Indicator, which leverages the SmartCycle bicycle detection algorithm, is a device that mounts onto traffic signals and
illuminates when cyclists waiting at an intersection have been detected, allowing cyclists to avoid interacting with vehicle traffic to push pole-mounted buttons. 
 Our Vantage systems are also available with the PedTrax capability, which provides bi-directional counting and speed tracking of pedestrians
within the crosswalk to help improve signal timing efficiency, as well as providing an additional data stream to existing vehicle and bicycle counts. 
 VersiCam, our integrated camera and processor video detection system, is a cost-efficient video detection system for smaller intersections that
require only a few detection points. 

         We believe that future growth domestically and internationally, will be dependent in part on the continued adoption of above-ground video detection technologies, instead of traditional in-pavement loop technology, to manage traffic. 
 5

           In select territories, we also sell certain complementary original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") products for the traffic intersection market, which include, among other things, traffic signal controllers and traffic signal equipment cabinets. 
 


Transportation Systems 

         Our Transportation Systems segment includes engineering and consulting services focused on the planning, design, development and implementation of software and hardware-based ITS systems that integrate sensors, video surveillance, computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor, control and direct traffic flow, assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews, and distribute real-time information about traffic conditions. Our services include planning, design, implementation, operation and management of surface transportation infrastructure systems. We perform analysis and study goods movement, commercial vehicle operations, provide travel demand forecasting and systems engineering, and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion. 
         The Transportations Systems segment also includes our performance measurement and management solutions, Iteris Signal Performance Measures (SPM) and iPeMSa state-of-the-art information management software suite that provides prescriptive data insights to help determine current and future traffic patterns, permitting the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources. iPeMS utilizes a wide range of data resources and analytical techniques to determine current and future traffic patterns, permitting the effective performance analysis and management of traffic infrastructure resources. This information can then be analyzed by traffic professionals to measure how a transportation network is performing and to identify potential areas of improvement. iPeMS is also capable of providing users with predictive traffic analytics, and easy-to-use visualization and animation features based on historical traffic conditions. 
         We recently launched our comprehensive signal performance measures solution offering, Iteris SPM, a cloud-based application that provides proactive operations and signal maintenance with business process outsourcing and managed services. This offering is expected to be priced on a per intersection per month basis. 
         This segment also includes our advanced traveler information system solutions, as well as our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms, known as "CVIEW-Plus," "CheckPoint," "UCRLink" and "inspect." These platforms support state-based commercial vehicle operations by storing and distributing intrastate and interstate commercial vehicle information for local, state and federal agencies' roadside and enforcement operations. 
         Our Transportation Systems segment is largely dependent upon state and local governmental funding, and to a lesser extent federal governmental funding. In addition, various other funding mechanisms exist to support transportation infrastructure and related projects, including, but not limited to, bonds, dedicated sales and gas tax measures, and other alternative funding sources. We believe the overall expansion of our Transportation Systems segment in the future will continue to be dependent at least in part on the federal and local government's use of funds, and as in the past, our Transportation Systems business has been, at times, adversely affected by governmental budgetary issues. Delays in the allocation of funds may prolong uncertainty regarding the allotment of transportation funds in federal, state and local budgets. 
 


Agriculture and Weather Analytics 

         Our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment, which we formed during the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, consists of our ClearPath Weather and ClearAg solutions. 
         Our ClearPath Weather is a web-based solution, which includes a suite of tools that apply data assimilation and modeling technologies to assess weather conditions for customizable route/site weather 
 6

   and pavement forecasting, and render winter road maintenance recommendations for state agencies, municipalities and commercial companies to improve roadway maintenance decisions. 
         Our ClearPath Weather business is a market leader in performance management solutions for state organizations. We intend to use our strong brand and deep experience in the traffic management market, as well as our market-specific intellectual property, to expand our leadership in data aggregation and analytics in this market. 
         Beginning in late 2013, we undertook the development of "ClearAg solutions" for the digital agricultural market. These new products utilize and expand the intellectual property, technology base and product suites of our ClearPath Weather solutions. For our ClearAg solutions, we developed additional scientific and agronomic models and forecasts, expanded our computing infrastructure for additional big data acquisition and processing, and designed distributed delivery vehicles and products. 
         Our ClearAg solutions combine weather and agronomic data with proprietary land-surface modeling and analytics to solve complex agricultural problems and to increase the efficiency and sustainability of farmlands. The ClearAg Platform delivers validation tools for ag inputs, irrigation, field readiness, and harvest solutions giving growers, researchers and other agribusinesses access to a comprehensive database of historical, real-time and forecasted weather, soil and plant health information, as well as other information on crop growth. Companies use the ClearAg Platform to simulate field conditions and determine how new products may perform on a crop given certain weather and soil conditions. Growers and agribusinesses leverage the ClearAg Platform to determine the best times to plant, spray, fertilize, irrigate, and harvest crops. 
         Currently, we offer our ClearAg solutions on a subscription basis, with customers consuming ClearAg through our visualization component application programming interfaces ("APIs"). These APIs facilitate the integration of ClearAg's analytics and insights with the offerings of large enterprise customers in the agriculture market. We commenced commercial sales of the ClearAg solutions and related APIs in the first quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 ("Fiscal 2015"). 
         We expect market acceptance of our ClearAg solutions to continue to increase in upcoming quarters. We plan to continue to fund the investments in our ClearAg solutions, through cash flow generated from our Roadway Sensors and Transportation Systems operations, revenues from our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment, and our available cash on hand, as needed. We may also elect to raise additional equity for these investments. 
   Sales and Marketing 
         We currently sell our Roadway Sensors products through both direct and indirect sales channels. In the territories we sell through direct channels, we use a combination of our own sales personnel and outside sales organizations to sell, oversee installations, and support our products. Our indirect sales channel is comprised of a network of independent distributors in the U.S. and select international locations, which sell integrated systems and related products to the traffic management market. In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 ("Fiscal 2018"), we entered into a distribution agreement to expand our northern European sales coverage in the U.K. and Ireland. Our independent distributors are trained in, and primarily responsible for, sales, installation, set-up and support of our products, maintain an inventory of demonstration traffic products from various manufacturers, and sell directly to government agencies and installation contractors. These distributors often have long-term arrangements with local government agencies in their respective territories for the supply of various products for the construction and renovation of traffic intersections, and are generally well-known suppliers of various high-quality ITS products to the traffic management market. We periodically hold technical training classes for our distributors and end users, and maintain a full-time staff of customer support technicians throughout the U.S. to provide technical assistance when needed. When 
 7

   appropriate, we have the ability to modify or make changes to our distributor network to accommodate the needs of the market and our customer base. 
         We market and sell our Transportation Systems services and solutions and our ClearPath Weather services primarily to government agencies pursuant to negotiated contracts that involve competitive bidding and specific qualification requirements. Most of our contracts are with federal, state and local municipal customers, and generally provide for cancellation or renegotiation at the option of the customer upon reasonable notice and fees paid for modification. We generally use selected members of our engineering, science and information technology teams on a regional basis to serve in sales and business development functions. Our Transportation Systems contracts generally involve long lead times and require extensive specification development, evaluation and price negotiations. 
         Currently, we market and sell our ClearAg solutions on a subscription basis, under a SaaS license, to seed and crop protection companies, agriculture equipment manufacturers, irrigation solution providers, allied providers and other agriculture service providers. Due to the recent consolidation of certain large companies in the agriculture market, sales to such companies typically involve long lead times. Although we sell directly to all of our customers, some of these customers include ClearAg into their solutions which are ultimately used by growers. 
         We have a small dedicated software solutions sales team that serves as an overlay to our regionally aligned customer management team. 
         We have historically had a diverse customer base. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 ("Fiscal 2019") and Fiscal 2018, one individual customer represented greater than 10% of our total revenues. 
   Manufacturing and Materials 
         We use contract manufacturers to build subassemblies that are used in our Roadway Sensors products. Additionally, we procure certain components for our Roadway Sensors products from qualified suppliers, both in the U.S. and internationally, and generally use multi-sourcing strategies when technically and economically feasible to mitigate supply risk. These subassemblies and components are typically delivered to our Santa Ana, California facility where they go through final assembly and testing prior to shipment to our customers. Our key suppliers include Veris Manufacturing, MoboTrex, Inc. and Sony Electronics, Inc. Our manufacturing activities are conducted in approximately 9,000 square feet of space at our Santa Ana, California facility. Production volume at our subcontractors is based upon quarterly forecasts that we generally adjust on a monthly basis to control inventory levels. Typically, we do not manufacture any of the hardware used in the transportation management and traveler information systems that we design and implement. Our production facility is currently ISO 9001 certified. 
 Customer Support and Services 
         We provide warranty service and support for our products, as well as follow-up service and support for which we charge separately. Such service revenue was not a material portion of our total revenues for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 ("Fiscal 2017"). We believe customer support is a key competitive factor for our company. 
         Our ClearAg solutions are primarily sold as annual subscription services with recurring monthly revenue. As an element of these services, we provide full-time support and customer service for such ClearAg solutions.

     Backlog 
         Our total backlog of unfulfilled firm orders was approximately $55.4 million as of March 31, 2019, which included $44.5 million related to Transportation Systems, $6.2 million related to Roadway Sensors, and $4.7 million related to Agriculture and Weather Analytics. Typically, we recognize approximately 70% of our Transportation Systems backlog as of the end of a fiscal year in the subsequent fiscal year, and currently expect that trend to continue for the near future. Substantially the entire backlog for Roadway Sensors and Agriculture and Weather Analytics as of March 31, 2019 is expected to be recognized as revenue in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"). At March 31, 2018, we had backlog of approximately $47.5 million, which included $37.7 million related to Transportation Systems, $5.6 million related to Roadway Sensors and $4.2 million related to Agriculture and Weather Analytics. The increase in backlog in the current fiscal year was largely due to increased sales and marketing efforts in our Transportation Systems segment during the current fiscal year. 
         The timing and realization of our backlog is subject to the inherent uncertainties of doing business with federal, state and local governments, particularly in view of budgetary constraints, cut-backs and other delays or reallocations of funding that these entities typically face. In addition, pursuant to the customary terms of our agreements with government contractors and other customers, our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders with little or no penalties. Lead times for the release of purchase orders often depend upon the scheduling and forecasting practices of our individual customers, which also can affect the timing of the conversion of our backlog into revenues. For these reasons, among others, our backlog at a particular date may not be indicative of our future revenues, in particular for our Roadway Sensors segment. 
   Product Development 
         Our product development activities are mostly conducted at our principal facility in Santa Ana, California, as well as our facilities in Grand Forks, North Dakota and Oakland, California. Our research and development costs and expenses were approximately $7.8 million for Fiscal 2019, $7.9 million for Fiscal 2018, and $6.9 million for Fiscal 2017. We expect to continue to pursue various product development programs and incur research and development expenditures, primarily in our Agriculture and Weather Analytics and Roadway Sensors segments, in future periods. 
         We believe our engineering and product development capabilities are a competitive strength. We strive to continuously develop new products, technologies, features and functionalities to meet the needs of our ever-changing markets, as well as to enhance, improve upon, and refine our existing product lines. We plan to continue to invest in the development of our ClearAg and ClearPath Weather solutions, and our Iteris SPM, iPeMS, and commercial vehicle operations software offerings. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in further enhancements and functionality in our Vantage products family. We believe that developing new and enhanced product offerings across our segments and enhancing, refining and marketing our existing products are key components for strong organic growth and profitability. 
   Competition 
         Generally, we face significant competition in each of our target markets. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         The markets in which our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment operates vary from the commercial sector customers for ClearAg solutions to public sector customers for ClearPath Weather solutions. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. In the public sector, we compete with some of the same transportation engineering, planning and design firms that also compete with our Transportation Systems segment. In the commercial sector, we compete with a variety of entities that currently provide weather-related data to that market, such as IBM/The Weather Company and DTN.

        In the market for our Roadway Sensors detection products, we compete with manufacturers and distributors of other above-ground video camera detection systems such as Econolite, and manufacturers and distributors of other non-intrusive detection devices, including microwave, infrared, radar, ultrasonic and magnetic detectors, as well as manufacturers and installers of in-pavement inductive loop products, which have historically been, and currently continue to be, the predominant vehicle detection system in this market. Additionally, products such as Velocity and VantagePegasus compete against various competitors in the travel-time and data communications markets, respectively. 
         The markets in which our Transportation Systems segment operates is highly fragmented and subject to evolving national and regional quality, operations and safety standards. Our competitors vary in number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer. Our competitors in the managed services and consulting business lines include a mix of local, regional and international engineering services firms. Our competitors in the software business line, which includes performance measurement and management, advance traveler information systems, and our commercial vehicle operations and vehicle safety compliance platforms include university affiliated software organizations, venture backed software companies, as well as other multi-disciplinary hardware and software corporations. 
         In general, the markets for the products and services we offer are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. Many of our current and prospective competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, distribution and marketing resources than us. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging standards or technologies, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. It is also possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We believe that our ability to compete effectively in our target markets will depend on a number of factors, including the success and timing of our new product development, the compatibility of our products with a broad range of computing systems, product quality and performance, reliability, functionality, price and service, and technical support. Our failure to provide services and develop and market products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers and consultants in our target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 
         Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology. Our policy is to obtain appropriate proprietary rights protection for any potentially significant new technology acquired or developed by us. We currently have a total of 53 issued U.S. patents, including: (i) 10 relating to our Roadway Sensors technologies, two of which was issued in Fiscal 2019, (ii) 36 relating to our Agriculture and Weather Analytics technologies, ten of which were issued in Fiscal 2019, and (iii) 7 relating to our Transportation Systems technologies, one of which was issued in Fiscal 2019. We have a total of 14 pending patent applications in the U.S. and 15 pending foreign patent applications. The expiration dates of our patents range from 2026 to 2038. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
         In addition to patent laws, we rely on copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers and suppliers, proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants, and other similar measures. We do not have any material licenses or trademarks other than those relating to product names. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in protecting our proprietary rights. While we believe our patents, patent applications, software and other proprietary know-how have value, rapidly evolving technology makes our future success dependent largely upon our ability to successfully achieve continuing innovation. 
 10

           Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend us against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. An adverse outcome in such litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, both in legal fees and expenses, as well as from the diversion of management's resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
   Employees 
         As of March 31, 2019, we employed 362 full-time employees and 31 part-time employees, for a total of 393 employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 
 Government Regulation 
         Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those restricting the discharge of materials into the environment. We are not involved in any pending or, to our knowledge, threatened governmental proceedings, which would require curtailment of our operations because of such laws and regulations. We continue to expend funds in connection with our compliance with applicable environmental regulations. These expenditures have not, however, been significant in the past, and we do not expect any significant expenditure in the near future. Currently, compliance with foreign laws has not had a material impact on our business; however, as we expand internationally, foreign laws and regulations could have a material impact on our business in the future. 
      ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
        Our business is subject to a number of risks, some of which are discussed below. Other risks are presented elsewhere in this report and in the information incorporated by reference into this report. You should consider the following risks carefully in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, before deciding to buy, sell or hold our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.
           Because we depend on government contracts and subcontracts, we face additional risks related to contracting with federal, state and local governments, including budgetary issues and fixed price contracts. 
         A significant portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with governmental agencies, either as a general contractor, subcontractor or supplier. We anticipate that revenue from government contracts will continue to remain a significant portion of our revenues. Government business is, in general, subject to special risks and challenges, including:
 

 delays in funding and uncertainty regarding the allocation of funds to state and local agencies from the U.S. federal government, delays in the
expenditures from the federal highway bill and delays or reductions in other state and local funding dedicated for transportation and ITS projects; 

 11

   

 other government budgetary constraints, cut-backs, delays or reallocation of government funding, including without limitation, changes in the
new administration and repeal of government purchasing programs; 
 long purchase cycles or approval processes; 
 competitive bidding and qualification requirements, as well as our ability to replace large contracts once they have been completed; 
 changes in government policies and political agendas; 
 maintenance of relationships with key government entities from whom a substantial portion of our revenue is derived; 
 milestone deliverable requirements and liquidated damage and/or contract termination provisions for failure to meet contract milestone
requirements; 
 performance bond requirements; 
 adverse weather conditions may cause delays, such as, evacuations and flooding due to hurricanes can result in our inability to perform work in
affected areas; and 
 international relations and international conflicts or other military operations that could cause the temporary or permanent diversion of
government funding from transportation or other infrastructure projects. 

         Governmental budgets and plans are subject to change without warning. Certain risks of selling to governmental entities include dependence on appropriations and administrative allocation of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and regulations and other policies that may reflect political developments or agendas, significant changes in contract scheduling, intense competition for government business and termination of purchase decisions for the convenience of the governmental entity. Substantial delays in purchase decisions by governmental entities, and the current constraints on government budgets at the federal, state and local level, and the ongoing uncertainty as to the timing and accessibility to government funding could cause our revenues and income to drop substantially or to fluctuate significantly between fiscal periods. 
         In addition, a number of our government contracts are fixed price contracts. As a result, we may not be able to recover any cost overruns we may incur. These fixed price contracts require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project's requirements. The financial viability of any given project depends in large part on our ability to estimate these costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis. In the event our costs on these projects exceed the fixed contractual amount, we will be required to bear the excess costs. Such additional costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, certain of our government contracts are subject to termination or renegotiation at the convenience of the government, which could result in a large decline in our revenues in any given period. Our inability to address any of the foregoing concerns or the loss or renegotiation of any material government contract could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
           We recently expanded our Agriculture and Weather Analytics capabilities to address a new market segment, the digital agricultural market, which might not broadly accept our technologies and new products. 
         The application of data analytics to the agricultural market is a relatively new development that has required us to invest, and is expected to continue to require us to invest, in additional research and development, and sales and marketing without any guarantee of a commensurate increase in revenues. The introduction of any new Agriculture and Weather Analytics products and services could have longer than expected sales cycles, which could adversely impact our operating results. We cannot assure 
 12

   you that growers or other agribusinesses in this market will appreciate the value proposition of our offering or that our new ClearAg products for this market will achieve broad market acceptance in the near future or at all. If the agricultural market fails to understand and appreciate the benefit of our offering or chooses not to adopt our technologies, the financial results of our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment will be adversely affected. 
           We may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. 
         For Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018, and Fiscal 2017, we had net losses of approximately $7.8 million, $3.5 million and $4.8 million, respectively, and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Our ability to become profitable in future periods could be impacted by governmental budgetary constraints, government and political agendas, economic instability and other items that are not in our control. Furthermore, we rely on operating profits from certain of our business segments to fund investments in sales and marketing and research and development initiatives. We cannot assure you that our financial performance will sustain a sufficient level to completely support those investments. Most of our expenses are fixed in advance. As such, we generally are unable to reduce our expenses significantly in the short-term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues or increases in planned investments. As a result, we may continue to experience operating losses and net losses in the future, which would make it difficult to fund our operations and achieve our business plan, and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. 
           Our profitability could be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain adequate utilization of our Transportation Systems workforce. 
         The cost of providing our Transportation Systems engineering and consulting services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:
 

 our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees; 
 our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in our various regions; 
 the timing of new contract awards or the completion of large contract; 
 availability of funding or other budget issues; 
 our need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development and other non-chargeable activities; and 
 our ability to match the skill sets of our employees to the needs of the marketplace. 

         An inability to properly and fully utilize our Transportation Systems workforce would reduce our profitability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
           We may engage in acquisitions of companies or technologies that may require us to undertake significant capital infusions and could result in disruptions of our business and diversion of resources and management attention. 
         We may acquire additional complementary businesses, products, services, and technologies. Acquisitions may require significant capital infusions and, in general, acquisitions also involve a number of special risks, including:
 

 potential disruption of our ongoing business and the diversion of our resources and management's attention; 

 13

   

 the failure to retain or integrate key acquired personnel; 
 the challenge of assimilating diverse business cultures, and the difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and information
system of the acquired companies; 
 increased costs to improve managerial, operational, financial and administrative systems and to eliminate duplicative services; 
 the incurrence of unforeseen obligations or liabilities; 
 potential impairment of relationships with employees or customers as a result of changes in management; and 
 increased interest expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as unanticipated accounting charges. 

         Our competitors are also soliciting potential acquisition candidates, which could both increase the price of any acquisition targets and decrease the number of attractive companies available for acquisition. Acquisitions may also materially and adversely affect our operating results due to large write-offs, contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges or intangible asset amortization, or other adverse tax or accounting consequences. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any additional acquisitions, successfully integrate any acquisitions or realize the benefits anticipated from any acquisition. 
           We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 
         We have historically experienced volatility in our earnings and cash flows from operations from year to year. We have filed a registration statement on a Form S-3, utilizing a "shelf" registration process, and may consider a new equity financing in the future. Should the credit markets further tighten or our business declines, we may need or choose to raise additional capital to fund our operations, to repay indebtedness, pursue acquisitions or expand our operations. Such additional capital may be raised through bank borrowings, or other debt or equity financings. We cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, and such additional financing may result in further dilution to our stockholders. 
         Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
 

 market acceptance of our products and product enhancements, and the overall level of sales of our products; 
 our ability to control costs and achieve profitability; 
 the supply of key components for our products; 
 our ability to increase revenue and net income; 
 increased research and development expenses and sales and marketing expenses; 
 our need to respond to technological advancements and our competitors' introductions of new products or technologies; 
 capital improvements to new and existing facilities and enhancements to our infrastructure and systems; 
 any acquisitions of businesses, technologies, product lines, or possible strategic transactions or dispositions; 
 our relationships with customers and suppliers; 

 14

   

 government budgets, political agendas and other funding issues, including potential delays in government contract awards; 
 our ability to successfully negotiate credit arrangements with our bank and the state of the financial markets in general; and 
 general economic conditions, including the effects of the economic slowdowns and international conflicts. 

         If our capital requirements are materially different from those currently planned, we may need additional capital sooner than anticipated. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to continue our operations as planned, develop or enhance our products, expand our sales and marketing programs, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. 
           We participate in the software development market which may be subject to various technical and commercial challenges. 
         We have only been in the business of software development for a few years and have in the past and may in the future experience development and technical challenges. Our business and results of operations could also be seriously harmed by any significant delays in our software development activities. Despite testing and quality control, we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software after its release. Any faults or errors in our existing products or in any new products may cause delays in product introduction and shipments, require design modifications, or harm customer relationships or our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business and competitive position. In addition, software companies are subject to litigation concerning intellectual property disputes, which could be costly and distract our management. 
           If we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards, we will not be able to remain competitive, and the demand for our products will likely decline. 
         Our markets are in general characterized by the following factors:
 

 rapid technological advances; 
 downward price pressures in our target markets as technologies mature; 
 changes in customer requirements; 
 additional qualification requirements related to new products or components; 
 frequent new product introductions and enhancements; 
 inventory issues related to transition to new or enhanced models; and 
 evolving industry standards and changes in the regulatory environment. 

         Our future success will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to effectively develop, introduce, market and gain broad acceptance of new products and product enhancements incorporating the latest technological advancements. 
 15

             If we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a cost-effective and timely manner, or are unable to achieve market acceptance of our new products, our operating results would be adversely affected. 
         We believe our revenue growth and future operating results will depend on our ability to complete development of new products and enhancements, introduce these products in a timely, cost-effective manner, achieve broad market acceptance of these products and enhancements, and reduce our production costs. During the past two fiscal years, we have introduced both new and enhanced products across all segments. We cannot guarantee the success of these products, and we may not be able to introduce any new products or any enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, the introduction of any new products could adversely affect the sales of certain of our existing products. 
         We believe that we must continue to make substantial investments to support ongoing research and development in order to develop new or enhanced products and software to remain competitive. We need to continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate the latest technological advancements in outdoor image processing hardware, camera technologies, software and analysis in response to evolving customer requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately manage product transition issues. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or changing customer requirements or if we cannot adequately manage inventory issues typically related to new product transitions and introductions. We cannot assure you that any such investments in research and development will lead to any corresponding increase in revenue. 
           If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our customer's personal and/or proprietary data in connection with our web-based and mobile application services, we may suffer various negative impacts, including a loss of customer and market confidence, loss of customer loyalty, and significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses whose information was being stored. 
         Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers. 
           The markets in which we operate are highly competitive with many companies more established than Iteris. 
         We compete with numerous other companies in our target markets including, but not limited to, large, multi-national corporations and many smaller regional engineering firms. 
         We compete with existing, well-established companies and technologies in our Roadway Sensors segment, both domestically and abroad. Only a portion of the traffic intersection market has adopted advanced above-ground detection technologies, and our future success will depend in part upon gaining broader market acceptance for such technologies. Certain technological barriers to entry make it difficult for new competitors to enter the market with competing video or other technologies; however, we are aware of new market entrants from time to time. Increased competition could result in loss of market share, price reductions and reduced gross margins, any of which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
         The Transportation Systems market is highly fragmented and is subject to evolving national and regional quality and safety standards. Our competitors vary in size, number, scope and breadth of the products and services they offer, and include large multi-national engineering firms and smaller local or regional firms. 
 16

           The markets in which our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment operates vary from public sector customers who focus on snow and ice management for state and county roadways, to commercial sector customers who employ our environmental content and agronomic models. Our competitors include divisions of large, international weather companies, as well as a variety of small providers in the road weather market. In the commercial agriculture sector, we compete with a variety of public and private entities that currently market software, agronomic analytics and weather forecast capabilities to agribusinesses. 
         In each of our operating segments, many of our competitors have far greater name recognition and greater financial, technological, marketing and customer service resources than we do. This may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. It may also allow them to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services than we can. Consolidations of end users, distributors and manufacturers in our target markets exacerbate this problem. As a result of the foregoing factors, we may not be able to compete effectively in our target markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
           We may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could harm our competitive position. 
         If we are not able to adequately protect or enforce the proprietary aspects of our technology, competitors may be able to access our proprietary technology and our business, financial condition and results of operations will likely be seriously harmed. We currently attempt to protect our technology through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and similar means. Despite our efforts, other parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our technologies or systems. Our competitors may also be able to independently develop products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or design around our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights adequately in the U.S. or internationally. 
         Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation may also be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity by others. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to litigation regarding our intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome in litigation or any similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license disputed rights from others or require us to cease marketing or using certain products or technologies. We may not be able to obtain any licenses on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may have to indemnify certain customers or strategic partners if it is determined that we have infringed upon or misappropriated another party's intellectual property. Our recent expansion into software development activities may subject us to increased possibility of litigation. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of addressing any intellectual property litigation claim, including legal fees and expenses, and the diversion of management's attention and resources, regardless of whether the claim is valid, could be significant and could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
           Our failure to successfully secure new contracts and renew existing contracts could reduce our revenues and profitability. 
         Our business depends on our ability to successfully bid on new contracts and renew existing contracts with private and public sector customers. Contract proposals and negotiations are complex and frequently involve a lengthy bidding and selection process, which are affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions, financing arrangements and required governmental approvals. For 
 17

   example, a customer may require us to provide a surety bond or letter of credit to protect the client should we fail to perform under the terms of the contract. If negative market conditions materialize, or if we fail to secure adequate financing arrangements or the required governmental approval or fail to meet other required conditions, we may not be able to pursue particular projects, which could reduce or eliminate our profitability 
           We may continue to be subject to traffic related litigation. 
         The traffic industry in general is subject to frequent litigation claims due to the nature of personal injuries that can result from traffic accidents. As a provider of traffic engineering services, products and solutions, we are, and could from time to time in the future continue to be, subject to litigation for traffic related accidents, even if our products or services did not cause the particular accident. While we generally carry insurance against these types of claims, some claims may not be covered by insurance or the damages resulting from such litigation could exceed our insurance coverage limits. In the event that we are required to pay significant damages as a result of one or more lawsuits that are not covered by insurance or exceed our coverage limits, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or cash flows. Even defending against unsuccessful claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and result in a diversion of management's attention. 
           We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, including senior management, which could seriously harm our business. 
         Due to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent on the continued service of our executive officers and other key management, engineering and technical personnel. We believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team to retain existing business and generate new business. The loss of any of our officers, or any of our other executives or key members of management could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations (e.g., loss of customers or loss of new business opportunities). Our success will also depend in large part upon our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified engineering and other highly skilled technical personnel. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may adversely affect our growth in the current fiscal year and in future years. This situation is exacerbated by pressure from agency customers to contain our costs, while salaries for highly skilled employees are on the rise. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified skilled personnel, we may not be able to attract and retain such employees, that could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations, meet our customers' needs, win new business, and adversely affect our future results. Likewise, the future success of our Transportation Systems segment will depend on our ability to hire additional qualified engineers, planners and technical personnel. The future success of our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segment will depend on our ability to hire additional software developers, qualified engineers and technical personnel. Competition for qualified employees, particularly development engineers and software developers, is intense. We may not be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of such highly skilled employees. Our inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
           Our management information systems and databases could be disrupted by system security failures, cyber threats or by the failure of, or lack of access to, our Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system. These disruptions could negatively impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or significantly harm our reputation. 
         Internal users and computer programmers may be able to penetrate, aka "hack", our network security and create system disruptions, cause shutdowns and/or misappropriate our confidential 
 18

   information or that of our employees and third parties. Therefore, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by security breaches to our network. We must, and do, take precautions to secure customer information and prevent unauthorized access to our databases and systems containing confidential information. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of confidential, sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation. We operate our Enterprise Resource Planning system on a SaaS platform, and we use this system for reporting, planning, sales, audit, inventory control, loss prevention, purchase order management and business intelligence. Accordingly, we depend on this system, and the third-party provider of this service, for a number of aspects of our operations. If this service provider or this system fails, or if we are unable to continue to have access to this system on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, operations would be severely disrupted until an equivalent system could be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our operations. This disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business. 
           If we experience declining or flat revenues and we fail to manage such declines effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan and may experience future weaknesses in our operating results. 
         Based on our business objectives, and in order to achieve future growth, we will need to continue to add additional qualified personnel, and invest in additional research and development and sales and marketing activities, which could lead to increases in our expenses and future declines in our operating results. In addition, our past expansion has placed, and future expansion is expected to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. If we are unable to manage these activities or any revenue declines successfully, our growth, our business, our financial condition and our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected. 
           Our use of estimates in conjunction with the input method of measuring progress to completion of performance obligations for our Transportation Systems revenues could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues and profits. 
         A portion of Transportation Systems revenues are measured and recognized over time using the input method of measuring progress to completion. Our use of this accounting method results in recognition of revenues and profits proportionally over the life of a contract, based generally on the proportion of costs incurred to date to total costs expected to be incurred for the entire project. The effects of revisions to revenues and estimated costs are recorded when the amounts are known or can be reasonably estimated. Such revisions could occur in any period and their effects could be material. Although we have historically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion of long-term engineering, program management, construction management or construction contracts, the uncertainties inherent in the estimating process make it possible for actual costs to vary materially from estimates, including reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits. 
           Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negatively. 
         As of March 31, 2019, the value of securities available for sale within our investment portfolio was $1.9 million, which is generally determined based upon market values available from third-party sources. The value of our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity. Further, to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. Although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and 
 19

   mitigate potential impacts of market risks, including hedging-related strategies, those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Accordingly, we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly. 
           If our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business and stock price could be adversely affected. 
         Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 currently requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in all annual reports. We are required to obtain our auditors' attestation pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Going forward, we may not be able to complete the work required for such attestation on a timely basis and, even if we timely complete such requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm may still conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. 
         A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Iteris have been or will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. If we are not able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may lose the confidence of investors and analysts and our stock price could decline. 
           Our quarterly operating results fluctuate as a result of many factors. Therefore, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. 
         Our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. Factors that could affect our revenues include, among others, the following:
 

 delays in government contracts and funding from time to time and budgetary constraints at the federal, state and local levels; 
 our ability to access stimulus funding, funding from the federal highway bill or other government funding; 
 declines in new home and commercial real estate construction and related road and other infrastructure construction; 
 changes in our pricing policies and the pricing policies of our suppliers and competitors, pricing concessions on volume sales, as well as
increased price competition in general; 
 the long lead times associated with government contracts; 

 20

   

 the size, timing, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders; 
 our ability to control costs; 
 our ability to raise additional capital; 
 the mix of our products and services sold in a quarter, which has varied and is expected to continue to vary from time to time; 
 seasonality due to winter weather conditions (as well as the adverse impact on revenues in certain regions impacted from time to time by
hurricanes and other extreme conditions); 
 seasonality with respect to revenues from our ClearPath Weather and related weather forecasting services due to the decrease in revenues
generated for such services during the spring and summer time periods; 
 our ability to develop, introduce, patent, market and gain market acceptance of new products, applications and product enhancements in a timely
manner, or at all; 
 market acceptance of the products incorporating our technologies and products; 
 the introduction of new products by competitors; 
 the availability and cost of components used in the manufacture of our products; 
 our success in expanding and implementing our sales and marketing programs; 
 the effects of technological changes in our target markets; 
 the amount of our backlog at any given time; 
 the nature of our government contracts; 
 decrease in revenues derived from key or significant customers; 
 deferrals of customer orders in anticipation of new products, applications or product enhancements; 
 risks and uncertainties associated with our international business; 
 market condition changes such as industry structure consolidations that could slow down our ability to procure new business; 
 general economic and political conditions; 
 international conflicts and acts of terrorism; and 
 other factors beyond our control, including but not limited to, natural disasters. 

         Due to all of the factors listed above as well as other unforeseen factors, our future operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As a result of these quarterly variations, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. 
           Supply shortages or production gaps could materially and adversely impact our sales and financial results. 
         We have in the past experienced, and may from time to time in the future continue to experience parts shortages or unforeseen quality control issues by our suppliers that may impact our ability to meet demand for our products. We have historically used and continue to use single suppliers for certain significant components in our products, and have had to reengineer products from time to time to address obsolete components, especially in our Roadway Sensors products. Our Roadway Sensors 
 21

   products are also included with other traffic intersection products that also could experience supply issues for their products, which in turn could result in delays in orders for our products. Should any such supply delay or disruption occur, or should a key supplier discontinue operations, our future sales will likely be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, we rely heavily on select contract manufacturers to produce many of our products and do not have any long-term contracts to guarantee supply of such products. Although we believe our contract manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our production schedules for the foreseeable future and we believe we could find alternative contract manufacturing sources for many of our products, if necessary, we could experience a production gap if for any reason our contract manufacturers were unable to meet our production requirements and our cost of goods sold could increase, adversely affecting our margins. Further, the federal government has created the potential for significant changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source components for our Roadway Sensors products. Any such actions could increase the cost to us of such products and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such products, which could adversely affect the financial performance of our Roadway Sensors business. Similarly, these actions could result in cost increases or supply chain delays that impact third party products (e.g. steel poles) which could lead our customers to delay or cancel planned purchases by our products. 
           Our international business operations may be threatened by many factors that are outside of our control. 
         While we historically have had limited international sales, revenues and operational experience, we have been expanding our distribution capabilities for our Roadway Sensors and subscription customer base for our Agriculture and Weather Analytics segments internationally, particularly in Europe and in South America. We plan to continue to expand our international efforts, but we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such efforts. International operations subject us to various inherent risks including, among others:
 

 political, social and economic instability, as well as international conflicts and acts of terrorism; 
 bonding requirements for certain international projects; 
 longer accounts receivable payment cycles; 
 import and export license requirements and restrictions of the U.S. and each other country in which we operate; 
 currency fluctuations and restrictions, and our ability to repatriate currency from certain foreign regions; 
 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers or restrictions; 
 required compliance with existing and new foreign regulatory requirements and laws, more restrictive labor laws and obligations, including but
not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; 
 difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; 
 potentially adverse tax consequences; and 
 reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. 

         Substantially all of our international product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the relative value of the dollar could make our products more expensive and potentially less price competitive in international markets. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. 
 22

           Any of the factors mentioned above may adversely affect our future international revenues and, consequently, affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, as we pursue the expansion of our international business, certain fixed and other overhead costs could outpace our revenues, thus adversely affecting our results of operations. We may likewise face local competitors in certain international markets who are more established, have greater economies of scale and stronger customer relationships. Furthermore, as we increase our international sales, our total revenues may also be affected to a greater extent by seasonal fluctuations resulting from lower sales that typically occur during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world. 
           The trading price of our common stock is highly volatile. 
         The trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past. From March 31, 2016 through March 31, 2019, our common stock has traded at prices as low as $2.20 per share and as high as $8.17 per share. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors, including, but not limited to:
 

 quarterly variations in operating results; 
 our ability to control costs, improve cash flow and sustain profitability; 
 our ability to raise additional capital; 
 shortages announced by suppliers; 
 announcements of technological innovations or new products or applications by our competitors, customers or us; 
 transitions to new products or product enhancements; 
 acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies, or other possible strategic transactions or dispositions; 
 the impact of any litigation; 
 changes in investor perceptions; 
 government funding, political agendas and other budgetary constraints; 
 changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry in general; 
 changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts; and 
 international conflicts, political unrest and acts of terrorism. 

         The stock market has from time to time experienced volatility, which has often affected and may continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. This volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were to become the subject of a class action lawsuit, it could result in substantial losses and divert management's attention and resources from other matters. 
           Certain provisions of our charter documents may discourage a third party from acquiring us and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 
         Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it difficult for a third party to influence or acquire us, even though that might be beneficial to our stockholders. Such provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. For 
 23

   example, under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock with voting, conversion and other rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock. In addition, our bylaws contain provisions governing the ability of stockholders to submit proposals or make nominations for directors, and we recently eliminated cumulative voting for directors and implemented majority voting for the election of directors of the company.
