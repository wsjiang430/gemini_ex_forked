ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Diffusion is a biopharmaceutical company that has historically focused on developing novel therapies that may enhance the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to the areas where it is needed most. Our most advanced product candidate, TSC, has been investigated and developed to enhance the diffusion of oxygen to tissues with low oxygen levels, also known as hypoxia, a serious complication of many of medicine’s most intractable and difficult-to-treat conditions, including hypoxic solid tumors like GBM.
Ongoing Evaluation of Strategic Opportunities
 
In early 2022, we identified the pursuit of an opportunistic transaction with the potential to complement and diversify our portfolio of product candidates as one of our key strategic objectives for the year. The intended purpose is to reduce the Company's overall risk profile as an investment and enhance long-term value for our stockholders. In pursuit of this objective, during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first half of 2022, our management team held conversations with several potential counterparties and, in July 2022, we engaged Canaccord Genuity LLC as our financial advisor to support the ongoing evaluation. In October 2022, following further deterioration of the public capital markets throughout 2022, and the corresponding increase in the cost of capital for small biopharmaceutical companies, we publicly announced our Board's authorization of an expanded evaluation and review of potential transactions, including a joint venture, licensing, merger, reverse merger, sale or divestiture of some of the Company’s proprietary technologies or a sale of the Company, among others. Since that time, our management team has been increasingly focused on advancing this strategic review process through conversations about potential deal constructs with multiple companies, both including and excluding the Company’s lead asset, TSC. However, there is no assurance the Board’s review will result in any transaction being consummated. Any further comments or disclosures regarding the strategic review process will be made from time to time as and when we determine an update is appropriate.
Our Most Advanced Historical Development Programs: Trans Sodium Crocetinate
 
Prior to the initiation of our strategic review process, our core focus was the development and commercialization of novel therapies that enhance the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to areas where it is needed most and improve treatment outcomes for patients suffering from conditions complicated by hypoxia. The Company’s development efforts have been primarily focused on advancing our most advanced product candidate, TSC, and we continue to believe TSC has potential benefits for patients, particularly as an adjuvant treatment to standard of care therapy for GBM and other hypoxic solid tumors. In connection with our strategic review process and pending its conclusion, we have paused significant portions of our TSC development activities, including initiation of our previously announced Phase 2 study of TSC in newly diagnosed GBM patients.

Trans Sodium Crocetinate: Enhancing Oxygen, Fueling Life
 
We believe TSC is the first therapeutic candidate specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of the oxygen diffusion process. By supporting normal, physiologic levels of oxygen diffusion at the uptake and delivery points of the circulatory system, we believe TSC may have the ability to improve the current standard-of-care treatment for conditions complicated by hypoxia. Furthermore, in animal models, TSC’s diffusion-enhancing mechanism of action has been observed to affect hypoxic tissue preferentially while avoiding excessive oxygen-related tissue toxicity.
TSC's Demonstrated Clinical Safety Profile
 
TSC has been observed to be safe and well-tolerated at a variety of doses in over 220 subjects included in clinical studies conducted to date, including those studies that evaluated the effects of TSC in patients with medical conditions often complicated by hypoxia, such as GBM, peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication, stroke, COVID-19, and interstitial lung disease. We have also obtained valuable new data from our COVID Trial and Oxygenation Trials demonstrating TSC's safety and effects on oxygenation at higher doses and increased dosing frequencies compared to those previously evaluated.
 
The TSC Oxygenation Trials: Evaluating the Clinical Effects of TSC
 
Our Oxygenation Trials, conducted during 2021 and 2022, were a series of three, short-term clinical studies using experimental models to evaluate the clinical effects of TSC on oxygenation. Each of these three studies was designed to look at the effects of TSC on a different component of the oxygenation pathway and fill information gaps related to the effects of TSC on tissue oxygen levels and other direct clinical parameters related to oxygen levels. We believe the results of the Oxygenation Trials provide proof of concept of TSC’s effects on tissue oxygenation, in addition to supplementing our knowledge with new information related to TSC’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

TCOM Trial: TSC's Effects on Peripheral Tissue Oxygenation
 
In June 2021, we reported a positive trend among patients who received TSC, when compared to placebo, in peripheral tissue oxygenation measured with the use of a transcutaneous oxygen monitoring (TCOM) device. These results can be seen in the figure below which was created during a supplemental analysis of the TCOM Trial results by subtracting the median response observed in the TCOM Trial’s placebo group from the median response observed in each TSC dosage group at each of the measurement times during the one-hour period following dosing.
 
These data highlight the persistent increase in peripheral tissue oxygenation relative to that observed in the placebo group through the duration of the one-hour measurement period following TSC administration, particularly at the two highest TSC doses tested (2.0 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg administered intravenously).

Altitude Trial: TSC's Effects Under Induced Hypoxic Conditions
 
In June 2022, we reported that, following exercise under hypoxic (i.e., simulated high altitude) conditions, participants in our Altitude Trial treated with the highest dose of TSC (2.5 mg/kg) demonstrated an effect on physiologic indicators of enhanced oxygenation when compared to placebo, including an increase in plasma pH and a decrease in plasma lactate, both at the end of the exercise period and at 10 minutes post-exercise. We believe these data suggest the 2.5 mg/kg dose of TSC decreased blood acidity (i.e., lactic acid accumulation) and enhanced metabolic recovery at 10 minutes after completion of exercise under the stressful conditions of exercise at simulated high altitude.
 
Additional positive results observed in the Altitude Trial included:
 

• | Positive effects on lactate and pH relative to participants' baseline measurements were observed among the TSC 2.5 mg/kg dose cohort at the end of the exercise period;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A “carry-over” effect was observed in participants who received TSC in the first treatment (“ascent”) of the day versus those who received placebo first and TSC for the second ascent; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The 2.5 mg/kg dose appeared to have a positive effect on post-exercise recovery based on comparison of the measurements for pH, lactate, oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other markers of oxygenation at 10 minutes post-exercise versus last exercise measurements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ILD-DLCO Trial: TSC's Effects on Oxygen Transfer Efficiency
 
In December 2021, we announced dosing of the first patients in our ILD-DLCO Trial, which was designed to evaluate the effects of TSC in certain patients with previously diagnosed ILD using the diffusion of carbon monoxide through the lungs, or DLCO, as a surrogate measure of oxygen transfer efficiency. In August 2022, in order to dedicate more of our human and other resources to our strategic review process and ongoing challenges enrolling patients in clinical trials for respiratory indications due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we made the decision to terminate recruitment and enrollment in the ILD-DLCO Trial and wind the trial down.

TSC's Potential as Supplement to Standard of Care Therapy for Hypoxic Solid Tumors

As seen in the positron emission tomography scans above, we have previously obtained and published evidence supporting TSC’s ability to enhance oxygenation of C6 glioma tumors in animals. We also have obtained clinical evidence of TSC’s effects in unresectable GBM tumors from our previously completed Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating 59 patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Although not prospectively defined, a post hoc subgroup analysis of inoperable patients suggested a higher proportion of TSC-treated patients survived at two years compared to those in the historical control group. Based upon these data, we made the decision to pursue the development of TSC as a treatment for hypoxic solid tumors when administered with standard-of-care radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
Our Phase 2 GBM Trial
 
GBM is an aggressive, deadly, and treatment-resistant type of malignant brain tumor, affecting approximately 13,000 newly diagnosed patients each year in the United States. Few treatment options are available for patients with GBM, and none have extended life expectancy beyond a few months. In fact, according to the National Brain Tumor Society, the five-year survival rate for GBM is only 6.8 percent with an average survival time of eight months. Despite recent advances in treatment modalities, we believe an effective treatment for GBM remains a significant unmet medical need.
 
Based upon data from the inoperable patient subgroup in our Phase 2 GBM trial and guidance from the FDA received at our End-of-Phase-2 meeting, we initiated a Phase 2b/3 GBM Trial in patients with newly diagnosed inoperable GBM in December 2017. The trial was designed to enroll 236 patients, split evenly between the TSC treatment arm and the control arm, with TSC to be administered in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and temozolomide, an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug, during the adjuvant treatment chemotherapy period. The trial began with a 19 patient, FDA-mandated, open-label, dose-escalation safety run-in phase for which enrollment was completed in 2019. At a meeting in the third quarter of 2019, the data safety monitoring board for the trial concluded that no adverse safety signal was present and unanimously recommended the GBM Trial continue as planned. However, due to a lack of financial resources at the time, the Company did not initiate the randomized portion of the study.

Our Hypoxic Solid Tumor Program
 
In July 2022, we announced alignment with the FDA on the design of an open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 2 safety and efficacy study of TSC administered with standard of care to newly diagnosed GBM patients, designated "Study 200-208." The design of this trial has been reviewed and cleared to proceed by the FDA’s Office of Oncologic Diseases. Key elements of the Study 200-208 trial design include the following:

• | Innovative incorporation of PET scans and hypoxia-specific radiotracers to evaluate the oxygenating enhancing effects of TSC on tumor hypoxia;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PET scan data readouts from the first phase of the trial are expected to be available within one year of the first patient being dosed, multiple years earlier than the survival data readout in most clinical trials involving hypoxic solid tumor patients; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Building upon the knowledge obtained in our COVID and Oxygenation Trials, patients in Study 200-208 would receive TSC at a significantly increased dose (up to 2.5 mg/kg v. 0.25 mg/kg) and frequency (five days/week v. 3 days/week) as compared to our prior GBM trials, representing an increase in weekly TSC exposure of nearly 1,700% at the highest potential dose.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As of the date of this Annual Report, the design of Study 200-208 is complete, but in connection with our ongoing strategic review process and pending its conclusion, we have paused significant portions of our TSC development activities including initiation of Study 200-208.
 
Studies of TSC in Other Conditions Complicated by Hypoxia and Beyond
 
Beyond cancer, hypoxia is a complicating factor in many other intractable and difficult-to-treat conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, skin and soft tissue diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition to our oncology programs, we have previously conducted a variety of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the effects of TSC in several of these other potential indication areas and conditions complicated by hypoxia, including COVID-19, stroke, peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication, and we believe TSC's oxygen-enhancing mechanism of action could potentially provide benefits to patients and individuals suffering from one or more of these or other related indications or conditions.
 
TSC has also been evaluated in a variety of preclinical models intended to mimic relevant human conditions known to be complicated by hypoxia. In these studies, a variety of positive effects have been observed in connection with TSC administration, including:
 

• | Reducing hypoxia in rat brain tumors without hyper-oxygenation of normal tissue;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving survival in highly lethal adult and pediatric brain tumor models when added to standard of care therapy, including radiotherapy administered either alone or in combination with chemotherapy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving tissue oxygenation without hyper-oxygenation of normal tissue and reducing infarct size in a rat ischemic stroke model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrating a functional benefit in a rabbit ischemic stroke model, with or without tissue plasminogen activator at one-hour post-clot infection and with tissue plasminogen activator at three hours post-clot infection; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improving levels of arterial partial pressure of blood oxygen in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Product Development
 
Research and Development
 
In recent years, the majority of our research and development expenditures have been directed to the development of TSC. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred approximately $7.2 million in costs related to research and development of our products, a decrease of approximately $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The majority of these costs were related to the development of TSC and related personnel, including costs associated with the Oxygenation Trials.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that a strong intellectual property portfolio is critical to our success. We are committed to obtaining and maintaining appropriate patent and other protections for our products candidates and other technologies, preserving and protecting our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information, and fiercely defending our intellectual property portfolio against any potential infringement by third parties. We attempt to protect our intellectual property through among other things, the filing of applications for patent, trademark, and other appropriate intellectual property protections, the use of confidentiality agreements with consultants, contractors and other third parties, our employee policies regarding confidentiality, invention disclosure, and the assignment of inventions, as well as regular meetings of members of our internal development and legal teams, which contains key members of our management team. We are also committed to operating our business without infringing on the intellectual property of others.
 
In general, patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained, with term adjustments or extensions possible in certain cases based on patent office delays or pursuant to certain administrative and legislative exceptions. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
We have invested significant time, effort, and resources into the development and maintenance of our patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 19 issued U.S. patents and 34 issued non-U.S. patents, and had numerous patent applications pending worldwide including issued patents and applications in major markets such as the U.S., E.U., China, Japan, and India. The normal life (i.e. with no adjustments or extensions) of our key issued patents related to the current liquid formulation of TSC extends to 2026, with potential patent term extensions to 2031, and the normal life of our patents related to an oral formulation of TSC extends to 2031, with potential patent term extensions to 2036. The normal life of our key issued patents related to methods of use of TSC extends to 2037, with potential patent term extensions to 2042. For additional information regarding patent term extensions, see "Business — Government Regulation— The Hatch-Waxman Amendments — Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity. In addition, TSC has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of both GBM and metastatic brain cancer, which may provide us with a right of exclusivity under certain FDA regulations. For additional information regarding orphan and ultra-orphan designations, see "Business — Government Regulation — Certain Other FDA Regulations — The Orphan Drug Act of 1983.”

Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls
 
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We have used third-party CMOs to manufacture API, other starting materials, and finished drug product for our preclinical studies, although we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any CMO to cover commercial production of any of our product candidates.
Commercial Outlook
 
Competition
 
Our future commercial and competitive outlook is highly dependent on the outcome of our ongoing strategic review process and therefore currently subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
 
With respect to our most advanced current product candidate, TSC, current medical options to improve oxygenation without risk of hyper-oxygenation are limited. However, there are several companies currently developing or marketing oxygen enhancing products, therapeutics, or devices that may nevertheless be competitive with TSC, if approved, including Hemoglobin Oxygen Therapeutics LLC, Hemotek Medical Inc., NuvOx Pharma LLC, Omniox, Inc., and VirTech Bio Inc.
 
More generally, our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change. Potential competitors in the United States are numerous and include major pharmaceutical and specialty pharmaceutical companies, smaller biopharmaceutical companies, research universities, and others. The biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing, and marketing of health care products competitive with those that we are developing. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, substantially greater financial resources, and larger research and development staffs than we do, as well as substantially greater experience than us in developing products, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. In addition, a significant amount of research is carried out at academic and government institutions. These institutions are aware of the commercial value of their findings and are aggressive in pursuing patent protection and negotiating licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed. One or more of these companies or other entities may have one or more products under development that would be competitive with our current or future product candidates.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We currently have no marketed products and, accordingly, currently have no sales or marketing personnel.
 
Government Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical product candidates are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries at the federal, state, and local levels. These regulations are numerous and extensive in their scope, relating to, among other things, the research and development, manufacture, storage, quality control and testing, approval, labeling and packaging, promotion, marketing, and advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, export and import, and record keeping of pharmaceutical products.
The FDA Drug Approval Process
 
Generally, before a new pharmaceutical product can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each applicable regulatory authority, submitted for review, and approved by the competent regulatory authority. In the United States, the competent regulatory authority is the FDA, which, pursuant to the FDC Act, is responsible for the review and approval of all data required to support a license to commercially market pharmaceutical products.

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with FDA regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or, if approved, following approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations.
 
Process Overview
 
The FDA drug approval process generally involves the following steps:
 

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory studies, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical trials involving human subjects or patients may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, GCP requirements, and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication, including approval by an IRB or independent ethics committee before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA as to whether it will accept the filing for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic or drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources and satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years, though the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the applicable product or indication to be treated. We cannot be certain that any approvals for any product candidates we attempt to develop in the future will be granted on a timely basis or at all.
 
Preclinical Studies
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information related to the drug, including information regarding its chemical make-up, manufacturing process, and quality controls, as well as a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
   8

  

Clinical Trials
 
Following completion of preclinical studies and the submission on an IND to the FDA, a 30-day waiting period is required. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. These trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations as well as GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors. Each trial is conducted under a protocol detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, especially in certain indications such as cancer.
 

• | Phase 1 - In Phase 1 trials, an investigational new drug is introduced into healthy human subjects and is evaluated to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, in certain cases, early evidence on efficacy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 - In Phase 2 trials, the drug is introduced to a limited patient population in a particular indication to determine metabolism, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for the indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify potential adverse effects and safety risks.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 - In Phase 3 trials, if a drug has demonstrated evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in prior Phase 2 trials, the drug is introduced to a larger patient population in the relevant indication to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug, if approved.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Not all drug development programs are required to follow the order and content of all three phases. For example, in August 2018, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled “Expansion Cohorts: Use in First-In-Human Clinical Trials to Expedite Development of Oncology Drugs and Biologics,” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development, i.e., the first-in-human clinical trial, to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial. Information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts is included in IND applications and assessed by FDA. Expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 
   9

  

Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 
New Drug Application and FDA Review Process
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA containing data intended to provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the relevant indication, and FDA approval of the NDA is required before commercial marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial, and the submission of most NDAs is also subject to substantial initial and ongoing fees.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the NDA will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review subject to certain performance goals agreed upon by the FDA. Priority review can be applied in certain instances, including with respect to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process, whether standard or priority, may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities at which the drug is manufactured to confirm compliance with cGMP. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. This advisory committee is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts in the relevant indication or subject matter who review and evaluate the NDA and provide a recommendation to the FDA as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA, the clinical sites, the manufacturing facilities, and, as needed, receives a recommendation from the advisory committee, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of new information included.
 
FDA Approval Letter
 
An FDA approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy including, in certain cases, REMS as described in more detail under the heading “—Certain Other FDA Regulations – Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies.” Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Further, changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

The Hatch-Waxman Amendments
 
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, is a 1984 U.S. federal law which established the modern system of generic drug regulation in the U.S. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments were enacted to encourage the manufacture of generic drugs by outlining the process for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to file an abbreviated new drug application and to provide certain related protections to drug development innovators, namely a new kind of market exclusivity period and the ability to potentially extend patent life by a portion of the time a drug is under regulatory review by the FDA.
Orange Book Listing and Abbreviated New Drug Applications
 
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an ANDA.
 
An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
 
An ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any such patents listed in the Orange Book for the approved reference drug intended to confirm that the proposed generic equivalent will not infringe on any intellectual property related to the reference drug, commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. The ANDA process gives the owner of the reference drug an opportunity to assert a patent infringement claim if it believes its intellectual property rights are being infringed upon following the submission of a Paragraph IV certification.
 
An ANDA will not be approved until all patents and non-patent exclusivity periods listed in the Orange Book for the reference drug have expired.
 
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Certain of our current and future product candidates may be eligible for patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment.
 
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally 50% of the amount of time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDC Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDC Act provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example investigations related to new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. The FDC Act also provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance.
 
During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. Three-year and five-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 
Certain Other FDA Regulations
 
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. For example, we previously announced that our product candidate TSC was granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of GBM and metastatic brain cancer in July 2011 and in December 2012, respectively. However, orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process but may result in certain financial and marketing incentives if approved.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same drug and same indication, as defined by the FDA, for which we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received, we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the E.U. has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
 
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than IMM that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. If the FDA determines that the conditions of approval are not being met, the FDA can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug.
 
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
In 2012, Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.
 
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. On December 27, 2020, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program was extended. Under the current statutory sunset provisions, after September 30, 2024, FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, FDA may not award any Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher.

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose to the public certain clinical trial information, including information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites, investigators, and other aspects of the trial design. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. However, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved as competitors may otherwise use this or other publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs and gain a competitive advantage.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies and Other Post-Approval Requirements
 
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a REMS to help ensure that the benefits of the drug’s continued approval outweigh the potential risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary, the drug sponsor must agree to the REMS plan at the time of approval. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. Elements to assure safe use can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring requirements, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug product.
 
Even if the FDA does not require a REMS, once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval regulations. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Adverse event reporting and the submission of periodic reports are also required following FDA approval of an NDA.
 
Drug Approval Process and Other Regulations Outside of the U.S.
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are and will be subject to the regulations of other countries in which we conduct any of our clinical trials or engage in commercial sales or other distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for conduct of a clinical trial or distribution of a product, we must obtain approval from the competent regulatory authority of any country or economic area in which we would seek to commence a clinical trial or market products. For example, conduct of the COVID Trial in Bucharest, Romania, required certain approvals from regulatory authorities in Romania and the E.U. Certain countries outside of the United States have a process similar to the FDA’s IND process which requires the submission of a CTA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the E.U., for example, a CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, which operates similar to an IRB under U.S. regulations. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, the clinical trial may proceed in the applicable country. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
In particular, in the E.U. a company may submit marketing authorization applications (comparable to an NDA submission in the US to the FDA) under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes and is optional for medicines which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this decentralized procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization in any E.U. member state may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within ninety days of receiving the applications and assessments report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. The E.U. also has procedures similar to those of the FDA pursuant to which a company may obtain marketing exclusivity for a product for up to 11 years and/or orphan drug designation and related exclusivity for up to ten years, as well as other expedited approval pathways available to certain drugs.
 
   14

  

In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the E.U. provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the E.U. do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
Certain Other Legislation and Regulations
 
Current Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Healthcare providers, physicians, and third party payors, including governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, will play a significant role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payors, healthcare providers, and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval.
 
These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, physician transparency, and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, and other federal, state, and local regulations and legislation impacting the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, including but not limited to those described below.
 

• | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - HIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. HIPAA, as amended by HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, imposes, among other things, specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state Attorneys General new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

• | Affordable Care Act - The ACA was enacted in March 2010 and included measures intended to significantly change the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both governmental and private insurers which have and may continue to impact the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, including expanded Medicare and Medicaid benefits, expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, establishment of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, annual reporting requirements for manufacturers and distributors. Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. In addition, subsequent legislation, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, has limited and supplemented various provisions of the ACA. While we cannot predict what effect further changes to the ACA would have on our business, the ACA is likely to continue to impact the regulatory regime to which we are subject for the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.

   15

  


• | 21st Century Cures Act - The 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, provided for a wide range of reforms to our industry, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections from genetic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product and compassionate use programs, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anti-Kickback Laws - The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug or any other good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | False Claims Laws - The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act - The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 imposes requirements on the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans, but plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any reduction in payment that results from the these or similar regulations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Physician Payments Sunshine Act - The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 - Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, or AMP, beginning January 1, 2024. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State, Local, and Non-U.S. Legislation and Regulations - In addition, to the legislation summarized above, we may also be subject now or in the future to analogous state, local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. Such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions. For example, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance, require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures. Certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and these data privacy and security laws may differ from both HIPAA and each other in significant ways, which would potentially increase our compliance burden.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
   16

  

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and settlements in the healthcare industry. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, additional oversight, and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
 
Future Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of proposed changes regarding the healthcare system and its regulation that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We expect that further implementation of current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any strategic collaborators, may receive for any approved products. Further, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.
 
For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
 
U.S. Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws
 
We are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. From time to time and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
 
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. In addition, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.
 
Public Company Status
 
As a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses to comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of SOX and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls, changes in corporate governance practices and required filing of annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel devote significant time and attention to these public company requirements.

Our People and Human Capital Resources
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 13 full-time employees, down from 16 employees as of December 31, 2021. On February 16, 2023, in connection with our ongoing strategic review process and efforts to utilize and preserve assets in a manner that maximizes value for its stockholders, Diffusion we committed to a reduction in force that impacted six of our employees and, as of the date of this Annual Report, we have seven full-time employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
 
We believe that an inclusive culture is required to understand and develop products that benefit all patients. By embracing differences, we aim to foster an environment of respect and trust in an effort to facilitate creativity, spark passion, and help us achieve better outcomes for all those who work at and with Diffusion. We are committed to creating and maintaining a workplace free from discrimination or harassment, including on the basis of any class protected by applicable law, and our recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation, and advancement practices are based on qualifications, performance, skills, and experience without regard to gender, race, or ethnicity. Our management team and employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical, and respectful conduct in the workplace, including adhering to the standards for appropriate behavior set forth in our code of conduct.
Compensation and Benefits
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment for human capital, particularly as we seek to attract and retain talent with relevant experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Therefore, we strive to provide a total rewards package to our employees that is competitive with our peer companies, currently including competitive pay, a comprehensive healthcare benefits package (including an 80% employer contribution to family medical coverage), 25 days of paid leave, a company-sponsored 401(k) savings plan, short-term and long-term disability, and other benefits, as well as remote working and flexible work schedules. We also offer every full-time employee the benefit of equity ownership in Diffusion through stock option grants. We believe these grants both help promote alignment between our employees and our stockholders and provide retention benefits, as the awards generally vest over a three-year period.
 
We do not have any employees that are represented by a labor union or that have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with the Company.
 
Safety and Wellness
 
At Diffusion, we believe that health matters to everyone, and the safety health, and wellness of our employees is one of our top priorities. We are committed to developing and fostering a work environment that is safe, professional, and promotes teamwork, diversity, and trust in order to afford all of our employees the opportunity to contribute to the best of their abilities. In recent years, we have taken certain measures and responded to changes in our operational needs, including actions designed to further promote a safe work environment for our employees, including investing in technology solutions to support increased work-from-home capabilities.
Employee Development and Training
 
Our employees are encouraged to attend scientific, clinical, technological, and other relevant meetings and conferences and we strive to provide employees access to a broad set of internal resources intended to help them be successful, including a variety of training and educational materials. We have also implemented a comprehensive employee evaluation program tied to the achievement of individual, team, and company goals to help further support, retain, and develop our people and further promote alignment of interests between our employees and our stockholders.
