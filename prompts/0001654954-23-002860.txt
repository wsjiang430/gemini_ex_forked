ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

Crexendo, Inc. is an award-winning premier provider of cloud communication platform and services, video collaboration and managed IT services designed to provide enterprise-class cloud solutions to any size business. Our solutions currently support over three million end users globally. By providing a variety of comprehensive and scalable solutions, we are able to cater to businesses of all sizes on a monthly subscription basis without the need for expensive capital investments, regardless of where their business is in its lifecycle. Our products and services can be categorized in the following offerings:
Cloud Telecommunications Services – Our cloud telecommunications services transmit calls using IP or cloud technology, which converts voice signals into digital data packets for transmission over the Internet or cloud. Each of our calling plans provides a number of basic features typically offered by traditional telephone service providers, plus a wide range of enhanced features that we believe offer an attractive value proposition to our customers. This platform enables a user, via a single “identity” or telephone number, to access and utilize services and features regardless of how the user is connected to the Internet or cloud, whether it’s from a desktop device or an application on a mobile device.

We generate recurring revenue from our cloud telecommunications services, broadband Internet services, managed IT services, software license sales, and infrastructure as a service. Our cloud telecommunications contracts typically have a thirty-six to sixty month term. We may also charge activation and flash fees and the Company generally allocates a portion of the activation fees to the desktop devices, which is recognized at the time of the installation or customer acceptance, and a portion to the service, which is recognized over the contract term using the straight-line method. We also charge other various contracted and non-contracted fees.

We generate product revenue, equipment financing revenue, and device as a service revenue from the sale and lease of our cloud telecommunications equipment. Revenues from the sale of equipment, including those from sales-type leases, are recognized at the time of sale or at the inception of the lease, as appropriate.

Software Solutions – Our software solutions segment derives revenues from three primary sources: software licenses, software maintenance support and professional services. Software and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. Generally, contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, consisting of software and services. For bundled packages, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct – i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the software licenses and professional services.  For items that are not sold separately (e.g. additional features) the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices using the adjusted market assessment approach. When we provide a free trial period, we do not begin to recognize recurring revenue until the trial period has ended and the customer has been billed for the services.

We generate software license revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses, term-based software licenses that expire, and Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") based software which are referred to as subscription arrangements. The Company does not recognize software revenue related to the renewal of subscription software licenses earlier than the beginning of the subscription period. 

We generate subscription and maintenance support revenue from customer support and other supportive services. The Company offers warranties on its products. The warranty period for our licensed software is generally 90 days. Certain of the Company's warranties are considered to be assurance-type in nature and do not cover anything beyond ensuring that the product is functioning as intended. Based on the guidance in ASC 606, assurance-type warranties do not represent separate performance obligations. The Company also sells separately-priced maintenance service contracts, which qualify as service-type warranties and represent separate performance obligations. The Company does not typically allow and has no history of accepting material product returns.  Customer support includes software updates on a when-and-if-available basis, telephone support, integrated web-based support and bug fixes or patches. Subscription and maintenance support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the customer support agreement, which is typically one year. 

We generate professional services and other revenue from consulting, technical support, resident engineer services, design services and installation services. Revenue for professional services and other is recognized when the performance obligation is complete and the customer has accepted the performance obligation.

The platform includes a broad range of feature-sets, custom-built to provide unprecedented levels of flexibility, making the solution competitive with the market’s leading players. SNAPsolution includes a full suite of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)/UC features with one low cost universal license, as opposed to pricing each feature individually. The Company licenses its platform based on concurrent sessions, not per seat/per feature. This allows service providers to oversubscribe their networks, driving down the cost per seat as volume increases. As the service provider increases their customer base, they only have to ensure they have sufficient concurrent call licenses to support users across the network.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We invested $3,955,000 and $1,396,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the research and development of our technologies and data centers. The majority of these expenditures were for enhancements to our cloud telecommunications products and services and continued development of our software solutions products.

COMPETITION

The market for cloud business communications services is large and increasingly competitive. We expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Some of these competitors include:

· | traditional on-premise, hardware business communications providers such as Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Mitel, NEC, and Siemens Enterprise Networks, LLC, any of which may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | software providers such as Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)) and BroadSoft, Inc. (acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc.) that generally license their software and may now or in the future also host their solutions through the cloud, and their resellers including major carriers and cable companies; 
· | established communications providers that resell on-premise hardware, software, and hosted solutions, such as AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc., CenturyLink, Cox, Charter and Comcast Corporation in the United States, TELUS and others in Canada, and BT, Vodafone, and others in the United Kingdom, all of whom have significantly greater resources than us and do now or may in the future also develop and/or host their own or other solutions through the cloud;
· | other cloud companies such as 8x8, Inc., RingCentral, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., DialPad, Inc., Fusion, Fuze (formerly Thinking Phone Networks), StarBlue (merger of Star2Star and BlueFace), Intermedia.net, Inc., J2 Global, Inc., Jive Communications, Inc. (acquired by LogMeIn, Inc.), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Teams (formerly Skype for Business)), Mitel, Nextiva, Inc., Slack Technologies, Inc., Vonage Holdings Corp., and West Corporation; 
· | other large internet companies such as Alphabet Inc., Facebook, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Zoom, and Salesforce.com, Inc., any of which might launch its own cloud-based business communication services or acquire other cloud-based business communications companies in the future; and 
· | established contact center providers such as Amazon.com, Inc., Aspect Software, Inc., Avaya Inc., Five9, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc., and NewVoiceMedia. 


The competitive landscape for our software solutions fall into two main categories, (1) other third party UCaaS platform vendors, such as Cisco, Mitel and Microsoft, and (2) third-party platforms hosted on service provider networks, e.g. 3CX, Ribbon, Avaya, NEC, Unify and Vodia.  

Additionally, should we determine to pursue acquisition opportunities, we may compete with other companies with similar growth strategies. Some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.

There are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Our proprietary technology does not preclude or inhibit competitors from entering our markets. In particular, we anticipate new entrants will attempt to develop competing products and services or new forums for conducting e-commerce and telecommunications services which could be deemed competition. Additionally, if telecommunications service providers with more resources and name recognition were to enter our markets, they may redefine our industry and make it difficult for us to compete.

Expected technology advances associated with the Cloud, increasing use of the Cloud, and new software products are welcome advancements that we believe will broaden the Cloud’s viability. We anticipate that we can compete successfully by relying on our infrastructure, marketing strategies and techniques, systems and procedures, and by adding additional products and services in the future. We believe we can continue the operation of our business by periodic review and revision to our product offerings and marketing approach.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success depends in part on using and protecting our proprietary technology and other intellectual property. Furthermore, we must conduct our operations without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely upon trade secrets and the know-how and expertise of our key employees. To protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, we rely on a combination of the protections provided by applicable copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although we believe we have taken appropriate steps to protect our intellectual property rights, including requiring employees and third parties who are granted access to our intellectual property to enter into confidentiality agreements, these measures may not be sufficient to protect our rights against third parties. Unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology, despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements. Others may independently develop or otherwise acquire unpatented technologies or products similar or superior to ours.

We license from third parties certain software and Internet tools, which we include in our services and products. If any of these licenses were terminated, we could be required to seek licenses for similar software and Internet tools from other third parties or develop these tools internally. We may not be able to obtain such licenses or develop such tools in a timely fashion, on acceptable terms, or at all.

Companies participating in the software, Internet technology, and telecommunication industries are frequently involved in disputes relating to intellectual property. We may be required to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement, duplication, discovery and misappropriation by third parties or to defend against third-party claims of infringement. Likewise, disputes may arise in the future with respect to ownership of technology developed by employees who were previously employed by other companies. Any such litigation or disputes could be costly and divert our attention from our business. An adverse determination could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from, or pay royalties to, third parties, or require us to develop appropriate alternative technology. Some or all of these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, we may be unable to develop alternate technology at an acceptable price, or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position, or results of operations.

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2022, we had 181 employees; 176 full-time and 5 part-time, including 10 executives, 45 sales representatives and sales management, 8 in marketing, 29 engineers and IT support, 73 in operations and customer support, 16 in accounting, finance, and legal.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

As a provider of Internet communications services, we are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FCC.  Some of these regulatory obligations include contributing to the Federal Universal Service Fund, Telecommunications Relay Service Fund and federal programs related to number administration; providing access to E-911 services; protecting customer information; and porting phone numbers upon a valid customer request. We are also required to pay state and local 911 fees and contribute to state universal service funds in those states that assess Internet voice communications services. We are a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) in forty-seven states. We are subject to the same FCC regulations applicable to telecommunications companies, as well as regulation by the public utility commission in these states. Specific regulations vary on a state-by-state basis, but generally include the requirement to register or seek certification to provide its services, to file and update tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for our intrastate services and to comply with various reporting, record-keeping, surcharge collection, and consumer protection requirements.

We are subject to regulations generally applicable to all businesses. We are also subject to an increasing number of laws and regulations directly applicable to telecommunication, internet access and commerce. The adoption of any such additional laws or regulations may decrease the rate of growth of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services. Such laws may also increase our costs of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business prospects, financial position or results of operations. Moreover, the applicability to the Internet of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy is uncertain. Future federal or state legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
