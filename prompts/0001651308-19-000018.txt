Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative molecularly-targeted and immuno-oncology drugs for the treatment of cancer. Our internally-developed lead drug candidates are currently in late-stage clinical trials, including 21 registration or registration-enabling trials in 14 discrete cancer indications. We have submitted three new drug applications for regulatory approval in China and are planning for new drug launches and additional submissions in China and the United States in 2019 and 2020. In addition, we are marketing three in-licensed cancer drugs in China from which we have been generating product revenue since September 2017.
We started as a research and development company in Beijing in 2010, focusing on developing best-in-class oncology drugs. Over the last nine years, we have developed into a fully-integrated global biotechnology company with operations in China, the United States, Europe and Australia, including a more than 800-person global clinical development team running over 50 ongoing or planned clinical trials as of January 24, 2019. We also have a growing commercial team that is selling our existing in-licensed drugs in China and preparing for launches of our internally-developed drug candidates in China and the United States, as well as internal manufacturing capabilities in China that are operational or under construction for the clinical and commercial supply of our small molecule and biologic drug candidates.
Our lead internally-developed drug candidates include the following:

• | Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) - a potentially best-in-class investigational small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, or BTK, designed to maximize BTK occupancy and minimize off-target effects, that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program in China and in other markets, including the United States, Europe and Australia, which we refer to as globally, for which we submitted for approval in China in 2018 initially for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, or CLL/SLL. We subsequently received priority review in China for both R/R MCL and R/R CLL/SLL. We also plan to submit in 2019 or early 2020 a new drug application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, and an NDA in China for Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, or WM. In the United States, the FDA has granted zanubrutinib Fast Track status in WM and Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. We plan to launch zanubrutinib in China and the United States if we receive approval from the relevant regulatory authorities;


• | Tislelizumab (BGB-A317) - an investigational humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1, or PD-1, specifically designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages, that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program for both solid tumor and hematological indications, both globally and in China, for which we submitted for approval in China in 2018 initially for the treatment of R/R classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or cHL. We subsequently received priority review in China, and we plan to launch tislelizumab in China if we receive approval. We also plan to file an NDA in China for the treatment of urothelial bladder cancer, or UBC; and


• | Pamiparib (BGB-290) - an investigational small molecule inhibitor of poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1, or PARP1, and PARP2 enzymes that is being evaluated in two pivotal clinical trials in China, a global Phase 3 trial, and earlier-stage trials in solid tumor cancers.

In addition to our three late-stage clinical drug candidates, our pipeline also includes three internally-developed drug candidates in early stage clinical development: lifirafenib (BGB-283), an investigational RAF dimer inhibitor; BGB-A333, an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor ligand PD-L1; and BGB-A425, an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against TIM-3. We also pursue in-licensing opportunities that, among other things, allow us to help our collaborators by leveraging our capabilities in clinical development and commercialization in China and other Asia-Pacific countries. Our business development efforts have led to a development-stage portfolio that includes sitravatinib, an investigational, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor in clinical development by Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., or Mirati, for which we have in-licensed development and commercial rights in Asia (excluding Japan), Australia and New Zealand; and ZW25 and ZW49, two bispecific antibody-based biologic drug candidates targeting HER2, in clinical 
3

development by Zymeworks Inc., or Zymeworks, for which we have in-licensed development and commercial rights in Asia (excluding Japan), Australia and New Zealand.
We entered into a strategic collaboration with Celgene Corporation in August 2017, in which we obtained an exclusive license to market in China Celgene’s approved cancer therapies ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID® and VIDAZA®, as well as rights in China to develop and commercialize avadomide (CC-122), an investigational next-generation Cereblon modulator currently in clinical development by Celgene outside of China for lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinomas, or HCC. As part of the collaboration, we also granted Celgene an exclusive right to develop and commercialize tislelizumab for solid tumors in the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of the world other than Asia.
We believe that we are well-positioned to capture significant market opportunities in China for innovative cancer therapies, including those created by recent regulatory reforms and new reimbursement policies. China is the second largest pharmaceutical market in the world based on revenue. We believe that there is a large and growing opportunity for novel cancer therapeutics in China based on significant unmet medical need, a large target patient population, expanding reimbursement coverage, and increasing treatment affordability and willingness to pay. In addition, China’s chief drug regulator, the National Medical Products Administration, or NMPA, has undertaken significant regulatory reforms that are designed to accelerate the development of new innovative drugs and allow China to be an integral part of global drug development. In addition, innovative oncology drugs have been included in the most recent National Reimbursement Drug List, or NRDL, reducing out-of-pocket expenses for patients. We believe that access to the large number of patients in China during clinical development as well as commercialization creates new opportunities for us. Leveraging our strong China presence and experience, as well as our commitment to global standards of innovation and quality, we believe that we have a unique ability to effectively take advantage of these opportunities.
Our Strategy
Our mission is to become a global leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies. In the near term, we plan to focus on pursuing what we believe are the following significant opportunities:

• | Globally Develop and Commercialize Zanubrutinib, a Potentially Best-in-Class BTK Inhibitor. Zanubrutinib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of BTK that is currently being evaluated both as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Our clinical experience to date suggests a potentially best-in-class profile. To pursue this opportunity, we are conducting a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China. We have submitted for approval in China for two indications based on single-arm Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with R/R CLL/SLL and R/R MCL. Both applications have been accepted and are being reviewed under priority review status. In addition, we are conducting three global Phase 3 trials: head-to-head against ibrutinib, an approved BTK inhibitor, for patients with WM; against bendamustine plus rituximab for patients with treatment naïve, or TN, CLL/SLL; and head-to-head against ibrutinib for patients with R/R CLL/SLL. Further, we are conducting a global pivotal Phase 2 trial in combination with obinutuzumab in follicular lymphoma, or FL, a pivotal Phase 2 trial in China in WM, and we have recently begun a global study in R/R marginal zone lymphoma, or MZL. Subject to the successful completion and satisfactory results of these trials, we expect to submit for approval of zanubrutinib in the United States in 2019 or early 2020, where it has been granted Fast Track status for patients with WM and Breakthrough Therapy designation for patients with R/R MCL. We also plan to file an NDA in China for patients with WM.


• | Develop and Commercialize Our Investigational Checkpoint Inhibitor, Tislelizumab, in a Rapidly and Favorably Evolving China Market and Other Markets. We believe that there is a large and growing opportunity for novel cancer therapeutics in China and that the market opportunity for PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapies may be especially attractive, as this class of agents has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in all four of the most common tumors in China: lung cancer, gastric cancer (GC), liver cancer and esophageal cancer (EC). We believe that we are uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity with our strong presence and experience in China and our integrated global clinical development capabilities in China and other Asia-Pacific countries, the United States, Europe and Australia. We have submitted an NDA in China to market tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with R/R cHL, and the application has been accepted and is being reviewed under priority review status. We are currently running 11 registration or potentially registration-enabling trials in six tumor types and expect to commence additional global pivotal trials in 2019 and 2020. We also plan to submit an NDA in China for patients with UBC. We have additional earlier stage exploratory studies ongoing, and we plan to initiate other studies.


• | Establish a Leadership Position by Further Expanding Our Capabilities. Although we believe that we have significant integrated capabilities in research and clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization, we plan

4

to continue to strengthen and expand our operations. In particular, we plan to significantly expand our commercial capabilities in China in preparation for the potential launch of our drug candidates and to support our existing marketed drugs. We have an established commercial team in China, which provides coverage of large hospitals and physician clients. As a result of the improving reimbursement environment in China, which is expected to provide access to innovative medicines for a significantly larger number of patients, we believe that the scale of our commercial organization and the breadth of our market coverage will become even more important. We plan to invest in expanding our teams of sales and marketing, market access, medical affairs, compliance, manufacturing, and other supporting functions. We aim to become a leading organization in the commercialization of oncology drugs in China. Outside of China, we are currently building commercial capabilities in the hematology-oncology area in the United States. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in building our global clinical development capabilities, which we believe will provide a competitive advantage in allowing us to conduct pivotal trials to support approvals globally and in China.

• | Take Advantage of Significant Regulatory Reforms in China to Accelerate Global Drug Development. Historically, the regulatory environment in China has been considered highly challenging, with clinical development significantly delayed and regulatory approvals taking much longer than in the United States and Europe. To address these challenges, the NMPA has issued a series of reform policies and opinions, which, among many things, are expected to expand access to clinical patients and expedite development and approval by removing delays and creating an environment with international quality standards for drug development, manufacturing and commercialization in China. We expect that these regulatory reforms will allow clinical trials in China to play a major role in global drug development programs. We also believe that the ability to effectively operate in China and integrate trials conducted in China with those in the rest of the world will be of increasing strategic importance. We are already taking advantage of these opportunities by conducting and leading dual-purpose global / China registration trials.


• | Expand Our Product Portfolio and Pipeline Through Collaborations with Other Biopharmaceutical Companies to Complement Our Internal Research. We expect to further expand our portfolio of drugs and drug candidates, in oncology as well as potentially in other therapeutic areas, through internal research and external collaborations, such as our collaborations with Celgene, Mirati and Zymeworks. We intend to pursue collaborations with other biopharmaceutical companies both in China and globally by leveraging our strong clinical development capabilities globally and our commercial capabilities in China. We have pursued and plan to continue to pursue business development opportunities in which development in China is expected to contribute to, and potentially accelerate, the global development program. We believe that there will be increasing interest by international biopharmaceutical companies in seeking collaborations in Asia, particularly in oncology, because clinical recruitment is a major bottleneck in new drug development.

Our Clinical-Stage Drug Candidates
A description of our clinical-stage drug candidates, together with a summary of the most recently available publicly reported clinical data from key clinical trials as of the date of this Annual Report, is set forth below. We plan to make available subsequent clinical data from time to time in our press releases and/or filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Hong Kong Stock Exchange, copies of which are available on the Investors section of our website.
Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111), a BTK Inhibitor
Zanubrutinib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of BTK that is currently being evaluated in a broad pivotal clinical program globally and in China as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies to treat various lymphomas. Zanubrutinib has demonstrated higher selectivity against BTK than IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib), an approved BTK inhibitor, based on our biochemical assays; higher exposure than ibrutinib based on their respective Phase 1 experience in separate studies; and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in both the peripheral blood and lymph node compartments.
Mechanism of Action
BTK is a key component of the B-cell receptor, or BCR, signaling pathway and is an important regulator of cell proliferation and cell survival in various lymphomas. BTK inhibitors block BCR-induced BTK activation and its downstream signaling, leading to growth inhibition and cell death in certain malignant white blood cells called B-cells. Zanubrutinib is an orally active inhibitor that covalently binds to BTK, resulting in irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.

Market Opportunity and Competition
Lymphomas are blood-borne cancers involving lymphatic cells of the immune system. They can be broadly categorized into non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or NHL, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, or HL. Depending on the origin of the cancer cells, lymphomas can also be characterized as B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. B-cell lymphomas make up approximately 85% of NHLs and comprise a variety of specific diseases involving B-cells at differing stages of maturation or differentiation. According to statistics from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results, or SEER, program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute, there were 72,240 new NHL cases and 20,140 deaths, and 20,110 new CLL cases and 4,660 deaths in 2017 in the United States. Similar SEER analyses calculate U.S. incidence rates for MCL of 3,000 and 1,350 for WM. According to a published study (Chen et al., Cancer Statistics in China, 2015, CA Cancer J. Clin. 2016; 66(2):115-32), which we refer to as Chen et al. 2016, and GLOBOCAN’s online Global Cancer Observatory analyses on cancer statistics in China, there are an estimated 88,200 to 93,097 new lymphoma cases and 52,100 to 50,865 deaths in China each year, and of the lymphoma cases, approximately 90% are NHL and approximately 4.5% of the NHL cases are CLL/SLL.
Conventional methods of treating lymphomas vary according to the specific disease or histology, but generally include chemotherapy, antibodies directed at CD20, a molecular marker found on the surface of B-cells, and, less frequently, radiation. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new therapies for lymphomas, including BTK inhibitors, the PI3K inhibitors, idelalisib, copanlisib and duvelisib, and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. Most recently, a cell-based therapy, YESCARTA® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, who have failed at least two other kinds of treatment. YESCARTA® is a genetically modified autologous T-cell immuno-oncology therapy directed at CD19.
The BTK inhibitor IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) was first approved by the FDA in 2013 for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Since that time, ibrutinib has received supplemental FDA approvals for the treatment of patients with CLL, CLL patients with 17p deletion, patients with WM, patients with MZL who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy, patients with chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, for use in combination with obinutuzumab in CLL, and in combination with rituximab in WM. Ibrutinib is also approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of patients with MCL, CLL and WM. Ibrutinib has been approved in over 90 countries and regions, and it was approved and launched in China at the end of 2017. In 2018, global revenues for BTK inhibitors were approximately US$4.5 billion according to published reports. Another BTK inhibitor, CALQUENCE® (acalabrutinib) was approved by the FDA in 2017 under accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. In late 2017, ibrutinib was the first BTK inhibitor approved and launched in China, for the treatment of patients with R/R CLL/SLL and R/R MCL. Subsequently, in July 2018, ibrutinib was also approved for first-line CLL.
Summary of Clinical Results
As of January 25, 2019, we had enrolled more than 1,300 patients in clinical trials of zanubrutinib, including trials of zanubrutinib in combination with other therapies, which we refer to as combination trials. A multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trial is being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, South Korea and European countries to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary activity of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, such as WM, CLL/SLL, FL, and MCL. The initial results of the dose-escalation phase and dose-expansion phase of this trial demonstrated that, consistent with zanubrutinib’s pharmacokinetic profile, complete and sustained 24-hour BTK occupancy in the blood was observed in all tested patients, starting at the lowest dose of 40 mg once daily. In addition, sustained full BTK occupancy was observed in the lymph nodes especially for the 160 mg twice daily dosing regimen. There is no guarantee that these results will be reproduced in pivotal trials.
Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia
On October 12, 2018, data from our Phase 1 trial in patients with WM were presented at the 10th International Workshop on Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (IWWM). As of the data cutoff of July 24, 2018, 77 patients with WM were enrolled in the study, and 62 patients remained on study treatment. Responses were determined according to the modified Sixth International Workshop on WM Criteria.
Seventy-three patients were evaluable for efficacy in this analysis and the median follow-up time was 22.5 months (4.1-43.9). The median time to response (>PR, or partial response) was 85 days (55-749). At the time of the data cutoff, 62 patients remained on study treatment. The overall response rate, or ORR, was 92% (67/73), the major response rate, or MRR, was 82%, and 41% of patients achieved a very good partial response, or VGPR, defined as a >90% reduction in baseline IgM levels and improvement of extramedullary disease by CT scan. The 12-month progression-free survival, or PFS, was estimated 
7

at 89%. The median PFS had not yet been reached. The median IgM decreased from 32.7 g/L (5.3-91.9) at baseline to 8.2 g/L (0.3-57.8). The median hemoglobin increased from 8.85 g/dL (6.3-9.8) to 13.4 g/dL (7.7-17.0) among 32 patients with hemoglobin <10 g/dL at baseline. 
MYD88 genotype was known in 63 patients. In the subset known to have the MYD88L265P mutation (n=54), the objective response rate was 94%, the major response rate was 89%, and the VGPR rate was 46%. In the nine patients known to be MYD88WT, a less common genotype that historically has had sub-optimal response to BTK inhibition, the ORR was 89%, the MRR was 67%, and the VGPR rate was 22%.
Zanubrutinib was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no discontinuation for zanubrutinib-related toxicity. The majority of adverse events, or AEs, were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent AEs of any attribution were petechia/purpura/contusion (43%), upper respiratory tract infection (42%), cough (17%), diarrhea (17%), constipation (16%), back pain (16%), and headache (16%). Grade 3-4 AEs of any attribution reported in three or more patients included neutropenia (9%), anemia (7%), hypertension (5%), basal cell carcinoma (5%), renal and urinary disorders (4%), and pneumonia (4%). Serious adverse events, or SAEs, were seen in 32 patients (42%), with events in five patients (7%) considered possibly related to zanubrutinib treatment: febrile neutropenia, colitis, atrial fibrillation, hemothorax, and pneumonia (n=1 each). Nine patients (12%) discontinued due to AEs: abdominal sepsis (fatal), septic shoulder, worsening bronchiectasis, scedosporium infection, gastric adenocarcinoma (fatal), prostate adenocarcinoma, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, or breast cancer (n=1 each, all considered by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment). Atrial fibrillation/flutter occurred in four patients (5%). Major hemorrhage was observed in two patients (3%). Four patients (5%) discontinued study treatment due to disease progression as assessed by investigator and one patient remains on treatment post-disease progression.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
On October 24, 2018, we announced the acceptance by the NMPA of our NDA for zanubrutinib for the treatment of patients with R/R CLL/SLL, together with the top line clinical data that supported the filing. The trial was a 91-patient single-arm pivotal Phase 2 study in Chinese patients with R/R CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib, dosed at 160 mg orally twice daily, or BID. An independent review of response data from this study, with a data cut-off of June 15, 2018 and a median follow-up of 9.1 months, showed an ORR of 80%, inclusive of complete response, or CR, of 2%, PR of 39%, and partial response with lymphocytosis, or PR-L, of 40%. The median duration of response had not been reached, as a majority of the responders remained in a response. The safety profile results were consistent with previously reported clinical data for zanubrutinib, which are described below. We plan to submit updated data with additional follow-up of the patients in this trial in support of the NDA.
On June 14, 2017, at the 14th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma in Lugano, Switzerland, data were presented from patients with CLL/SLL from the same Phase 1 trial that included WM patients described above. As of the data cutoff of March 31, 2017, 69 patients with CLL or SLL (18 TN, 51 R/R) were enrolled in the trial.
At the time of the data cutoff, 66 patients (16 TN and 50 R/R) had more than 12 weeks of follow-up and were evaluable for efficacy, and three other patients had less than 12 weeks of follow-up. After a median follow-up of 10.5 months (2.2-26.8 months), the ORR was 94% (62/66) with CRs in 3% (2/66), PRs in 82% (54/66), and PR-Ls in 9% (6/66) of patients. Stable disease, or SD, was observed in 5% (3/66) of patients. A patient with pleural effusion discontinued treatment prior to week 12 and was not evaluable for response. There was one instance of Hodgkin’s transformation. In TN CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up time of 7.6 months (3.7-11.6 months), the ORR was 100% (16/16) with CRs in 6% (1/16), PRs in 81% (13/16) and PR-Ls in 13% (2/16) of patients. In R/R CLL/SLL, at a median follow-up time of 14.0 months (2.2-26.8 months), the ORR was 92% (46/50) with CRs in 2% (1/50), PRs in 82% (41/50) and PR-Ls in 8% (4/50) of patients. SD was observed in 6% (3/50) patients.
Zanubrutinib was shown to be generally well-tolerated in CLL/SLL. The most frequent AEs (≥10%) of any attribution were petechiae/purpura/contusion (46%), fatigue (29%), upper respiratory tract infection (28%), cough (23%), diarrhea (22%), headache (19%), hematuria (15%), nausea (13%), rash (13%), arthralgia (12%), muscle spasms (12%) and urinary tract infection (12%). All of these events were grade 1 or 2 except for one case of grade 3 purpura (subcutaneous hemorrhage), which was the only major bleeding event. Additional AEs of interest included one case of each grade 2 diarrhea and grade 2 atrial fibrillation. A total of 18 SAEs occurred in 13 patients, with no SAE occurring in more than one patient. Only one patient discontinued treatment due to an AE, a grade 2 pleural effusion.

Mantle Cell Lymphoma
On December 1, 2018, at the 60th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting, in San Diego, CA, two data sets were presented on zanubrutinib in MCL patients from our Phase 2 and Phase 1 studies. 
The Phase 2 study was a single arm, open-label, multi-center, pivotal trial of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy in Chinese patients with R/R MCL that enrolled 86 patients who had received a median of two prior lines of therapy (range of 1-4). Patients were treated with zanubrutinib, dosed at 160 mg orally BID. The primary endpoint of the trial was ORR assessed by independent review committee, or IRC, using PET-based imaging according to the Lugano Classification 2014.
As of March 27, 2018, 85 patients with R/R MCL were evaluable for efficacy and 65 patients (75.6%) remained on study treatment. The median follow-up time for patients enrolled in the trial was 35.9 weeks (1.1-55.9). The IRC-assessed ORR was 83.5% (71/85); the CR rate was 58.8% (50/85); and the PR rate was 24.7% (21/85). The 24-week PFS was estimated at 82%. The median PFS had not yet been reached. With 24.1 weeks median follow-up (0.1-41.1), the median duration of response, or DOR, had not yet been reached and 90% of responders were still in response at 24 weeks. 
Zanubrutinib tolerability was generally consistent with previous reports in patients with various B-cell malignancies and the majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent AEs of any attribution were neutrophil count decreased (31.4%), rash (29.1%), upper respiratory tract infection (29.1%), and platelet count decreased (22.1%). The most frequently reported (in >5% of patients) grade 3 or higher AEs were neutrophil count decreased (11.6%) and lung infection (5.8%). Four patients (4.7%) had treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, leading to death (one case each of traffic accident, cerebral hemorrhage, pneumonia, and unknown cause in the setting of infection). Among events of special interest for BTK inhibitors, diarrhea was observed in nine patients (10.5%), all grade 1-2. Major hemorrhage was observed in one patient (1.2%) with a blastoid variant of MCL who had intra-parenchymal CNS bleeding. No cases of atrial fibrillation/flutter were reported in this trial.
The Phase 1 study is an open-label trial of zanubrutinib as a monotherapy in patients with different subtypes of B-cell malignancies, including MCL, and is being conducted in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Italy, and South Korea. As of July 24, 2018, 48 patients with TN (n=9) or R/R (n=39) MCL had been enrolled in the trial and the median follow-up time was 12.7 months (0.7-38.0). Forty-five patients including six with TN and 39 with R/R MCL, were evaluable for efficacy in this analysis, per the Lugano 2014 classification. At the time of the data cutoff, 26 patients remained on study treatment. 
The investigator-assessed ORR was 88.9% (40/45); the CR rate was 26.7% (12/45); and the PR rate was 62.2% (28/45). The majority of patients were assessed via CT-scan; PET scans were optional per trial protocol. The median DOR was 16.2 months and the median PFS for R/R patients was 18.0 months (0.7-30.7). 
Zanubrutinib tolerability was generally consistent with previous reports in patients with various B-cell malignancies and the majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent AEs of any attribution were petechia/purpura/contusion (33.3%), diarrhea (33.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (29.2%), fatigue (25.0%), and constipation (18.8%). Grade 3-5 AEs occurred in 56.3% of patients. Grade 3-5 AEs of any attribution reported in > three patients included anemia (8.3%), major hemorrhage (6.3%), cellulitis (6.3%), myalgia (6.3%), neutropenia (6.3%), pneumonia (6.3%); and thrombocytopenia (6.3%). Discontinuation due to AEs occurred in 18.8% of patients with all but one event (peripheral edema) determined to be unrelated to study drug. There were four deaths due to AEs, which were all determined by the investigators to be unrelated to zanubrutinib treatment.

Pooled Analysis of Safety Data from Monotherapy Trials
At the 23rd Congress of the European Hematology Association, or EHA 2018, the pooled safety data were presented from patients with various B-cell lymphomas in four ongoing zanubrutinib monotherapy studies, totaling 476 patients with a median exposure of seven months. Overall, the data suggested that exposure levels of zanubrutinib resulting in complete and sustained BTK inhibition can be achieved and that zanubrutinib was generally well-tolerated. There were infrequent AEs of interest with BTK inhibitor therapy, such as atrial fibrillation/flutter (2%), major hemorrhage (2%), and grade 3 and above diarrhea (1%). Treatment discontinuation due to zanubrutinib-related AEs was uncommon (3%). The majority of patients (94%) experienced one or more AEs of any attribution, primarily grades 1 or 2. The most common grade 3 or higher AEs of any attribution were neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased/febrile neutropenia (14%), anemia (7%) and thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased (7%). SAEs were reported in 116 patients (24%), with 38 patients (8%) assessed by the investigator as related to zanubrutinib. The most common SAEs were pneumonia/lung infection (6%), pleural effusion (1%), and febrile neutropenia (1%). The only treatment-related SAE reported in greater than 1% of patients was pneumonia/lung infection (2%). No cases of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, or PJP, or cytomegalovirus, or CMV, reactivation were reported. The most common bleeding events observed included petechiae/purpura/contusion (26%) and hematuria (11%). Major hemorrhage (2%) included gastrointestinal hemorrhage/melena (n=3), intraparenchymal CNS hemorrhage grade 5, hematuria, purpura, hemorrhagic cystitis, renal hematoma, and hemothorax (one each). The median time to first major hemorrhage was 1.2 months. Among patients with emergent atrial fibrillation/flutter (n=8), a majority had known risk factors including hypertension (n=2), pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n=2), and concurrent infection (n=1). The cumulative rates of grade 3 or higher infections were 14% at six months, 19% at 12 months and 21% at 18 months. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate was 1.82 per 100 person-months. The most common second primary malignancies included basal cell carcinoma (3%) and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (1%).
Clinical Development Plan
Based on the clinical data to date, we believe that zanubrutinib has a potentially best-in-class profile, and we are running a broad global pivotal program in multiple indications including seven registration or registration-enabling clinical trials.
Globally, we have an ongoing monotherapy head-to-head Phase 3 trial versus ibrutinib in WM, which has closed to new patient screening and completed enrollment having met the enrollment target. We are also conducting an ongoing Phase 3 trial compared to bendamustine and rituximab in patients with TN CLL/SLL and a head-to-head Phase 3 trial in R/R CLL/SLL versus ibrutinib. Additionally, we have an ongoing pivotal Phase 2 trial in combination with GAZYVA® (obinutuzumab) in patients with R/R FL, which is designed as a pivotal trial for accelerated or conditional approval and will require a confirmatory study, as well as a Phase 2 trial in patients with R/R MZL. 
Zanubrutinib was granted, by the FDA, Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with WM in July 2018, and was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation in January 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have 
10

received at least one prior therapy. We plan to submit in 2019 or early 2020 an NDA to pursue an approval of zanubrutinib in the United States.
In China, we are conducting three separate pivotal Phase 2 trials of zanubrutinib as monotherapy in patients with R/R MCL, R/R CLL/SLL, and WM. We have announced the acceptance of our filings for approval in MCL and CLL/SLL on August 26, 2018 and October 24, 2018, respectively.
If we receive conditional approval instead of full approval, we will be required to conduct one or more confirmatory studies after such conditional approvals. If approved, we plan to commercialize zanubrutinib shortly after approval. In addition, we are conducting a Phase 2 trial in China of zanubrutinib in patients with R/R DLBCL.
Tislelizumab (BGB-A317), an anti-PD-1 Antibody
Tislelizumab is an investigational humanized monoclonal antibody against the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 that is currently being evaluated in pivotal clinical trials globally and in China and for which we plan to commence additional pivotal trials as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care to treat various solid and hematological cancers. We have a global strategic collaboration with Celgene for tislelizumab for solid tumors outside of Asia (other than Japan) as further described in “--Celgene Collaboration.”
Mechanism of Action
Cells called cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, or CTLs, provide an important self-defense mechanism against cancer, patrolling the body, recognizing cancer cells due to immunogenic features that differ from normal cells, and killing cancer cells by injecting deleterious proteins into them. T-lymphocytes have various mechanisms that prevent them from damaging normal cells, among which is a protein called PD-1 receptor, that is expressed on the surface of T-lymphocytes. PD-L1 is an important signaling protein that can engage PD-1. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 sends an inhibitory signal inside the T-lymphocyte and suppresses its cytotoxic effects. Many types of cancer cells have hijacked the PD-L1 expression system that normally exists in healthy cells. By expressing PD-L1, cancer cells protect themselves from being killed by CTLs. Anti-PD-1 therapies are designed to bind to and block downstream activity of PD-1, allowing the immune system to combat cancer cells.
Tislelizumab is a monoclonal antibody designed to specifically bind to PD-1, without activating the receptor, thereby blocking engagement of PD-1 by its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Tislelizumab has demonstrated high affinity and specificity for PD-1 in preclinical studies. It is differentiated mechanistically from the currently approved PD-1 antibodies by an engineered Fc region designed to minimize binding to FcγR on macrophages, thereby abrogating antibody-dependent phagocytosis, a potential mechanism of T-cell clearance, which we believe may minimize potentially negative interactions with other immune cells based on preclinical data.
Market Opportunity and Competition
A number of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody drugs have been approved by the FDA. These include Merck’s KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), Bristol-Myers Squibb’s OPDIVO® (nivolumab), Roche’s TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab), AstraZeneca’s IMFINZI® (durvalumab), Pfizer and Merck Sereno’s BAVENCIO® (avelumab), and Regeneron and Sanofi’s LIBTAYO® (cemiplimab). In the global setting, several PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody agents are in clinical development in addition to tislelizumab, such as Novartis’ PDR-001, GlaxoSmithKline / Tesaro’s TSR042, Pfizer’s PF-06801591, and AstraZeneca’s MEDI0680. In China, as of February 20, 2019, there are four approved PD-1 antibodies, OPDIVO® (nivolumab) and KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), as well as Junshi’s TUOYI (toripalimab) and Innovent’s TYVYT (sintilimab), and there are no approved PD-L1 antibody agents yet. There are approximately six more PD-1 and PD-L1 agents in late stage development in China, of which one has filed for approval as of February 20, 2019.
Globally, the top four PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs had sales of approximately $15 billion in 2018 based on public reports. We believe that there is a large commercial opportunity in China for PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody drugs. Currently available clinical data suggest that some of the most prevalent cancers in China, such as lung cancer, GC, liver cancer and EC, are responsive to this class of agents. According to the World Health Organization's Globocan online database, China suffered 37%, 44%, 47%, and 54% of all deaths from lung cancer, GC, liver cancer and EC, respectively, in the world. Collectively, these four tumor types comprised over 2.3 million new cases in 2016 in China alone, according to Chen et al. 2016. In addition, China has a higher proportion of PD-1 responsive tumors in its total annual cancer incidence in comparison to other geographies like the United States and the European Union, or EU. According to Chen et al. 2016, the annual incidence of the top ten PD-1 responsive tumors in China is estimated to be 3.0 million out of 4.3 million in total annual cancer incidence. In comparison, the estimated annual incidence of the top ten PD-1 responsive tumors is 0.9 million out of 1.7 million in total annual cancer 
11

incidence in the United States, and 0.9 million out of the 1.8 million total in the EU5 countries (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain and Italy) according to SEER program of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization.
Summary of Clinical Results
As of December 8, 2018, we have enrolled over 2,200 patients in clinical trials of tislelizumab, including combination trials. Preliminary data from our monotherapy Phase 1 trials suggested that tislelizumab was generally well-tolerated and exhibited anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor types. There is no guarantee that these results will be reproduced in pivotal trials.
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma
On December 3, 2018, data from a pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial of tislelizumab in R/R cHL were presented at the ASH meeting. This single arm, open-label, multi-center, pivotal Phase 2 trial of tislelizumab as a monotherapy in Chinese patients with R/R cHL enrolled 70 patients who failed to achieve a response or progressed after autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT, or received at least two prior lines of systemic therapy for cHL and were not an ASCT candidate. Patients were treated with tislelizumab, dosed at 200 mg intravenously every three weeks. The primary endpoint of the trial is ORR-assessed by IRC using PET-based imaging according to the Lugano Classification 2014.
As of May 25, 2018, 70 patients with R/R cHL were evaluable for efficacy and 53 patients (75.7%) remained on study treatment. Thirteen patients received prior ASCT, and the remaining 57 patients were ineligible for prior ASCT, including 53 for failure to achieve an objective response to salvage chemotherapy, two for inadequate stem cell collection or unable to collect stem cells, and two for co-morbidities. The patients had a median of three prior lines of systemic therapy with a range of two to eleven. The median study follow-up was 7.85 months (3.4-12.7).
The ORR assessed by IRC was 85.7% (60/70); the CR rate was 61.4% (43/70); and the PR rate was 24.4% (17/70). Among patients who had received prior ASCT, 92.3% (12/13) achieved an objective response, with nine patients (69.2%) achieving a CR. The DOR had not yet been reached. The estimated event-free rates at nine months were 84%. PFS data were preliminary and six-month PFS was estimated at 80%. The median PFS had not yet been reached.
The majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequently reported TEAEs of any grade were pyrexia (52.9%), hypothyroidism (30.0%), weight increased (28.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (27.1%), cough (17.1%), white blood cell count decreased (14.3%), and pruritus (14.3%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurred in 21.4% of patients. The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher TEAEs were upper respiratory tract infection (2.9%) and pneumonitis (2.9%). Four patients (5.7%) discontinued study drug due to TEAEs, including pneumonitis (n=2), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n=1), and organizing pneumonia (n=1); there were no cases of TEAE leading to death. Immune-related AEs reported in more than five percent of patients included thyroid disorder (18.6%), pneumonitis (5.7%), and skin adverse reactions (5.7%).

Safety Results
The safety results of tislelizumab in clinical trials to date are consistent with its therapeutic class, having a relatively low rate of drug-related grade 3 or above toxicity. Across the monotherapy studies, the safety results were consistent with our two Phase 1 studies, and our first-in-human Phase 1 study TEAE are indicated in the table below. Over half of the patients in our two Phase 1 studies experienced a tislelizumab-related TEAE, though ≥ grade 3 events were less frequent (8% to 10%).

Immune-Related Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and Deaths
Immune-related TEAEs, or irTEAEs, of any grade were reported in approximately 25% of patients but were primarily low grade (3% to 5% ≥ grade 3). These irTEAEs, however, have well-established algorithms for treatment and are considered manageable. 
Across the monotherapy studies, the rate of treatment emergent SAEs, or TESAEs, ranged from 16% to 37% in patients with a variety of different disease characteristics. TESAEs considered to be related to treatment with tislelizumab were notably lower, ranging from 6% to 13%.
There have been some deaths reported across the active studies with clinical data available (as of the cut-off dates ranging from April 25, 2018 to August 29, 2018), of which less than 0.5% of the total patient population were deemed to be related to treatment with tislelizumab.
Clinical Development Plan
We are running a broad development program for tislelizumab, including 11 registration or registration-enabling clinical trials. These include global pivotal trials in Asia-prevalent cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, EC, GC and HCC, which are intended to support regulatory submissions globally and in China. We have initiated pivotal or Phase 3 trials to evaluate tislelizumab as a potential second- or third-line treatment compared to docetaxel in patients with NSCLC; as a potential first-line treatment compared to sorafenib in patients with HCC and in second or third line HCC used as a monotherapy; as a potential first-line treatment in GC in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy; and as a potential second-line treatment compared to investigator-chosen chemotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, or ESCC, and as a potential first-line treatment in advanced ESCC patients in combination with platinum and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Under our collaboration with Celgene, Celgene has opened enrollment in its first Phase 3 trial in Stage 3 NSCLC examining tislelizumab in combination with chemoradiation. We have also recently initiated a global Phase 2 trial in patients with relapsed or refractory mature T- and NK-cell lymphomas.
We have four China pivotal trials ongoing, including two Phase 2 trials in patients with R/R cHL and in patients with PD-L1 positive second/third-line urothelial cancer, or UC, and two Phase 3 trials in combination with chemotherapy -- one in patients with non-squamous NSCLC and the second in patients with squamous NSCLC. We submitted for approval for tislelizumab in China to treat R/R cHL and announced that this submission had been accepted on August 31, 2018, and received priority review on November 15, 2018. We expect to submit for approval in China for the treatment of patients with UC based on the results of the pivotal Phase 2 trial. If we receive conditional approval instead of full approval, we will be required to conduct one or more confirmatory studies after such conditional approvals. We also expect to submit for approval in China for tislelizumab for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, ESCC, GC and HCC based on our China trials and, where appropriate, our global studies.
Pamiparib (BGB-290), a PARP Inhibitor
Pamiparib is an investigational small molecule inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 that is being evaluated as a potential monotherapy and in combinations for the treatment of various solid tumors. We believe that pamiparib has the potential to be differentiated from other PARP inhibitors because of its brain penetration, greater selectivity, strong DNA-trapping activity, and good oral bioavailability demonstrated in preclinical models.
Mechanism of Action
PARP family members PARP1 and PARP2 play essential roles in cell survival in response to DNA damage. PARP1 and PARP2 are key base-excision-repair proteins that function as DNA damage sensors by binding rapidly to the site of damaged DNA and modulating a variety of proteins in DNA repair processes. Inhibition of PARPs prevents the repair of common single-strand DNA breaks, which leads to formation of double-strand breaks during DNA replication. Double-strand DNA breaks in normal cells are repaired by homologous recombination, and normal cells are relatively tolerant of PARP inhibition. On the other hand, cancer cells with mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene, or BRCA1/2 genes, which are key players in homologous recombination, are highly sensitive to PARP inhibition. This phenomenon is called “synthetic lethality” and is the foundation of the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors as a monotherapy for BRCA mutant cancers. In addition to hereditary BRCA1/2 mutations, the synthetic lethality concept has been broadened to include sporadic tumors that display homologous recombination deficiency, or HRD, a gene expression profile that resembles that of a BRCA deficient tumor. HRD can stem from somatic mutation of BRCA1/2, epigenetic silencing of BRCA genes or genetic or epigenetic loss of function of other genes in homologous recombination DNA damage repair pathways. Third-party clinical studies have published results 
14

demonstrating that sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies confers sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in OC as well. Thus, the application of PARP inhibitors is likely broader than BRCA or HRD mutations, and there is additional possibility to identify and enrich patient populations for PARP inhibition.
Another potential therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitors is in combination therapy, which has strong scientific rational. PARP proteins are key factors in base-excision-repair, which is critical for the repair of DNA lesions caused by some chemotherapeutic agents and by radiation. PARP inhibitors are hypothesized to potentiate cytotoxicity of DNA-alkylating agents such as platinum compounds, temozolomide and ionizing radiation, and may be used in combination with these agents in treating various cancers.
PARP inhibitors are also considered good potential combination partners with checkpoint inhibitors in part due to increased mutations in tumor cells as a result of the blockade of DNA repair by PARP inhibitors as a higher mutational load in cancers has been shown in clinical studies to correlate with improved response to checkpoint inhibitors. In addition, preclinical data suggest that BRCA mutant tumors which are sensitive to PARP inhibition are likely to be immunogenic and responsive to PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies.
Market Opportunity and Competition
We believe that the market opportunity for PARP inhibitors is large and expanding in various patient segments. Many tumor types have been shown to be responsive to PARP inhibitors, including OC, breast cancer, prostate cancer and GC. PARP inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging activity both in relapsed and refractory patients as well as in the maintenance setting. In the United States, in 2018 there were approximately 22,240 new cases of OC, 266,120 new cases of breast cancer, 164,690 new cases of prostate cancer, and 26,240 new cases of GC, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute's SEER online database. In China, each year there are approximately 52,000 new cases of OC, 272,000 new cases of breast cancer, 60,000 new cases of prostate cancer, and 680,000 new cases of GC according to Chen et al. 2016.
A number of PARP inhibitors have been approved by the FDA. These include AstraZeneca’s LYNPARZA® (olaparib), Clovis Oncology’s RUBRACA® (rucaparib), GlaxoSmithKline / Tesaro’s ZEJULA® (niraparib), and Pfizer’s TALZENNA® (talazoparib). AbbVie’s veliparib is in late-stage development. In 2017, global sales of the PARP class exceeded US$461 million according to company reports. In China, AstraZeneca received approval for olaparib in August 2018 under priority review that utilized international multi-center data. Zai Labs obtained the development and commercial rights for niraparib in China, and its NDA to the NMPA was accepted in December 2018 for use as maintenance therapy in OC. There are some other PARP inhibitors being developed by domestic Chinese companies, including fluzoparib from Hengrui and Hansoh, but none have been submitted to the NMPA as of February 6, 2019.
Summary of Clinical Data
As of November 6, 2018, we have enrolled over 360 patients in clinical trials of pamiparib, including three registration or registration-enabling clinical trials.
A multi-center, open-label Phase 1/2 trial of pamiparib is being conducted in Australia in patients with advanced solid tumors. On September 8, 2017, preliminary clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of pamiparib in patients with advanced solid tumors were presented at ESMO. As of June 1, 2017, 68 patients were enrolled in the trial. The median duration of therapy for all patients was 79 days (range 1 to 926 days). At the time of the data cutoff, 20 patients remained on treatment.
At the time of the data cutoff, 39 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, or EOC, or associated tumors such as fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers, were evaluable for efficacy. Among this group, there were three confirmed CRs, 10 confirmed PRs, and 21 cases of SD. Of the 23 evaluable patients with EOC or other associated tumors known to be BRCA-mutated, there were three CRs, seven PRs, and 10 cases of SD. Of the 13 evaluable patients whose BRCA gene types are wild type, there were two PRs. Of the three evaluable patients whose BRCA gene types were unknown, there was one PR. Complete and partial responses were observed in patients known to be platinum-resistant as well as patients with platinum-sensitive disease. There is no guarantee that these results will be reproduced in pivotal trials.
The safety analysis suggested that pamiparib was generally well-tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors. AEs assessed to be treatment-related occurred in 78% of patients and were all grade 3 or lower in severity. The most common treatment-related AEs (≥10% of patients) were nausea (56%), fatigue (40%), anemia (25%), vomiting (21%), diarrhea (21%), decreased appetite (15%), and neutropenia or neutrophil count decrease (12%). SAEs occurred in 46% of patients, and SAEs considered to be treatment-related and occurring in more than one patient included two cases each of nausea and anemia. Four 
15

patients reported dose-limiting toxicity, or DLT. Four patients had a TEAE with a fatal outcome; none were assessed as being treatment-related and all of which were associated with disease progression.
Ovarian Cancer
On April 16, 2018, preliminary clinical data from the open-label, multi-center Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of pamiparib in Chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic high-grade non-mucinous ovarian cancer, or HGOC, including fallopian cancer, or triple-negative breast cancer, or TNBC, who had disease progression following at least one line of chemotherapy were presented at the 2018 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL.
Patients were dosed at 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg BID. As of September 25, 2017, 15 female patients were enrolled, nine with HGOC and six with TNBC. Nine patients had received four or more prior lines of therapies. All nine patients with HGOC were platinum-resistant (n=8) or refractory (n=1). Seven patients had a confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCAm), including five patients with HGOC and two patients with TNBC and the remaining patients had BRCA 1/2 wildtype (BRCA-WT). The median duration of treatment was 2.5 months (range: 8-260 days).
As of September 25, 2017, 13 of the 15 patients were evaluable for antitumor activity; five patients remained on treatment. Two of the nine HGOC patients achieved a confirmed PR including one platinum-refractory patient with BRCA wildtype status and one platinum-resistant patient with BRCA1/2 mutation, six HGOC patients had SD (BRCAm, n=4 and BRCA-WT, n=2) and one patient discontinued before the first radiographic assessment. Of the six treated TNBC patients, five (BRCAm, n=1, BRCA-WT, n=4) experienced disease progression and one patient (BRCAm) discontinued before the first radiographic assessment. Four of these evaluable TNBC patients were BRCA-WT and all experienced disease progression during the previous platinum-based chemotherapy.
The safety analysis suggested that pamiparib was generally well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported across the dose range, with the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, confirmed as 60 mg BID. Asthenia (n=12) and nausea (n=12) were the most commonly reported TEAE. Severity of all AEs was grade 3 or less. Overall, three patients experienced a serious AE (grade 2 abdominal infection, n=1; grade 3 pleural effusion, n=1; grade 3 ileus, n=1), none of which were considered related to treatment. Two of the SAEs led to treatment withdrawal (abdominal infection, n=1; pleural effusion, n=1).
Glioblastoma Multiforme
On November 16, 2018, we announced data from an open-label, multi-center global Phase 1b/2 multiple-dose and dose-escalation trial of pamiparib plus radiation therapy, or RT, and/or temozolomide, or TMZ, in patients with newly diagnosed or R/R glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM, at the 23rd Annual Scientific Meeting and Education Day of the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO). This study was designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and clinical activity of the combination. Patients with newly diagnosed GBM with unmethylated MGMT (O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) promoter status (Arm A) received pamiparib (60 mg BID) over escalating time periods (two, four, or six weeks) in combination with RT over six to seven weeks. Patients with R/R GBM (Arm C) received pamiparib (60 mg BID) continuously plus TMZ administered on Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. After evaluation of safety and tolerability from Arm A and C, Arm B will enroll patients with newly diagnosed GBM and treat them with the triple combination of RT, pamiparib, and TMZ.
As of September 14, 2018, a total of 18 patients with newly diagnosed GBM were enrolled in Arm A (n=3, 6 and 9 in the two-, four-, and six-week cohorts respectively). The median study follow-up duration was 19 weeks (2-54). As of the data cutoff date, 15 of the 18 patients were evaluable for response per modified response assessment in neuro-oncology (mRANO) criteria. Two of 15 patients achieved a PR (one was confirmed) and six patients achieved stable disease (SD); the disease control rate was 53.3% (95% CI: 26.6-78.7). Five grade >3 AE (chills, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vertigo, one each, or 5.6%) were considered related to pamiparib or RT. Dose-limiting toxicities of fatigue, vertigo, and chills (one each) were reported. In Arm C, eight patients received TMZ at a fixed dose of 40 mg for 21 of 28 days and seven patients received 20 mg TMZ. The median study follow-up duration was 12.9 weeks (0.3-31.4). Ten of the 15 patients were evaluable per mRANO criteria and there were two PRs (one unconfirmed and one confirmed after data cutoff) and three SD. Grade >3 AEs included anemia (20%), fatigue (13.3%), and decreased lymphocyte count (13.3%), which were considered related to pamiparib or TMZ. Dose-limiting toxicities of nausea and neutropenia were reported. The combination of 21 days of 40 mg TMZ with pamiparib was not tolerable; a lower 20 mg TMZ dose evaluation in combination with pamiparib is ongoing.

Clinical Development Plan
In addition to the above trials, our global program includes a Phase 3 maintenance trial in patients with platinum-sensitive GC. In China, we are conducting a Phase 3 trial as a maintenance therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent OC in addition to an ongoing pivotal Phase 2 study in OC.
Lifirafenib (BGB-283), a RAF Dimer Inhibitor
Lifirafenib is an investigational novel small molecule inhibitor with RAF monomer and dimer inhibition activities. Lifirafenib has shown antitumor activities in preclinical models and in cancer patients with tumors harboring BRAF V600E mutations, non-V600E BRAF mutations or KRAS/NRAS mutations. We have been developing lifirafenib for the treatment of cancers with aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway, including BRAF gene mutations and KRAS/NRAS gene mutations where first generation BRAF inhibitors are not effective. The MAPK pathway consists of proteins in the cell that transmit a signal from a receptor on the surface of the cell to the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. This pathway plays an essential role in regulating cell proliferation and survival. We believe that lifirafenib as monotherapy or in combination with other agents may have potential for treating various malignancies, such as melanoma, NSCLC and endometrial cancer. In October 2018, we formed a collaboration with SpringWorks Therapeutics to investigate the combination of lifirafenib and their MEK inhibitor, PD-0325901, in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor RAS, RAF mutations and other MAPK pathway aberrations. This study is planned to commence in the first quarter of 2019.
Currently approved BRAF inhibitors include Roche’s ZELBORAF® (vemurafenib), Novartis’ TAFINLAR® (dabrafenib) and Array BioPharma's BRAFTOVI® (encorafenib). The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is approved in patients with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma, such as Novartis’ dabrafenib and MEKINIST® (trametinib), Genentech’s vemurafenib and COTELLIC® (cobimetinib), and Array Biopharma’s encorafenib and MEKTOVI® (binimetinib). We are aware of several other BRAF inhibitors in clinical development, such as Roche’s belvarafenib and Novartis’ LXH254.
Lifirafenib was evaluated in a multi-center, open-label Phase 1 trial conducted in Australia and New Zealand comprised of two parts - dose escalation and dose expansion - in patients with BRAF or KRAS/NRAS mutated solid tumors or patients with pancreatic cancer. Lifirafenib demonstrated antitumor activity in both BRAF and KRAS-mutated tumors in preclinical studies and in the dose-escalation portion of this Phase 1 trial.
Data from the dose-expansion portion of the trial were presented at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, Annual Meeting. The dose-expansion portion of the trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lifirafenib at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 30 mg once daily established in the dose-escalation part of the trial. In the dose-expansion portion, lifirafenib was generally well-tolerated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and continued to show antitumor activity in patients with BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors and patients with KRAS-mutated solid tumors. The safety analysis, which included 96 patients as of the September 12, 2016 cutoff, suggested that lifirafenib was generally well-tolerated at 30 mg once daily, with most drug-related AEs being grades 1 or 2 in severity. The most frequent drug-related AEs (≥10%) of any grade were fatigue (38.5%), dysphonia (26.0%), decreased appetite (21.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (21.9%), thrombocytopenia (19.8%), dermatitis acneiform (17.7%), diarrhea (16.7%), rash (16.7%), nausea (15.6%), hypertension (11.5%) and glossodynia (10.4%). The most frequent drug-related grade 3 and 4 AEs (≥ 2%, two patients or more) included fatigue (7.3%), hypertension (6.3%), thrombocytopenia (6.3%), pyrexia (3.1%), hyponatremia (2.1%), anemia (2.1%), neutropenia (2.1%), febrile neutropenia (2.1%), decreased platelet count (2.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase (2.1%), increased GGT (2.1%) and sepsis (2.1%).
The cutoff for the efficacy analysis was September 17, 2016. In seven patients with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma (including one V600K and one V600R) who were naïve to BRAF or MEK inhibitors, there were three PRs and three cases of SD. In three patients with BRAF V600-mutated PTC, there was one PR and two cases of SD. In six patients with KRAS-mutated NSCLC, there was one PR and two cases of SD. In ten patients with solid tumors with BRAF non-V600 mutations or solid tumors with BRAF V600 mutations that are not included in other cohorts, there were two PRs, in one patient with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma and one with BRAF V600E-mutated OC, and three cases of SD. In two patients with BRAF V600-mutated NSCLC, there was one unconfirmed PR and one case of SD. Additional cases of SD were observed in four of six melanoma patients with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma who had responses to, but developed resistance against, BRAF or MEK inhibitors, nine of 13 patients with BRAF V600-mutated CRC, five of five patients with KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer, 12 of 20 patients with KRAS/NRAS-mutated CRC, and 10 of 21 patients with other KRAS/NRAS-mutated solid tumors or pancreatic cancer. In the Phase 1a portion of the trial, confirmed objective responses included a CR in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma and two PRs, one in a patient with BRAF V600E-mutated thyroid cancer and one in a patient with KRAS-mutated endometrial cancer.

BGB-A333, a PD-L1 Inhibitor
BGB-A333 is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, the ligand of PD-1. We intend to develop BGB-A333 either as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer therapies, such as tislelizumab, to treat various cancers and potentially other areas of unmet need. BGB-A333 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in Australia to assess the safety and antitumor effect of BGB-A333 alone and in combination with tislelizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
BGB-A425, a TIM-3 Inhibitor
BGB-A425 is an investigational humanized IgG1-variant monoclonal antibody against T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3, or TIM-3. We began a Phase 1/2 trial of BGB-A433 in combination with tislelizumab in various solid tumors in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Sitravatinib (MGCD-0516), a Multi-Kinase Inhibitor
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mirati for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Mirati’s sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia and New Zealand. Sitravatinib is an investigational spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor which potently inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases, including RET, TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, MER), and split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT). Sitravatinib is being evaluated by Mirati in multiple clinical trials to treat patients who are refractory to prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, including a potentially registration-enabling Phase 3 trial of sitravatinib in non-small cell lung cancer projected to initiate in the first half of 2019. Sitravatinib is also being evaluated as a single agent in patients with NSCLC, melanoma and other solid tumor types whose tumors harbor specific genetic alterations in CBL. In recent data readouts by Mirati, sitravatinib has demonstrated durable responses in lung cancer patients who progressed after treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. We began a Phase 1 study of sitravatinib in combination with tislelizumab in various solid tumors in Australia and China in the third quarter of 2018.
Avadomide (CC-122), a Cereblon Modulator
Avadomide (CC-122) is an investigational next-generation Cereblon modulator currently in clinical development by Celgene. It is in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 clinical trials, both as a single agent and in combination, for hematological and solid tumor cancers outside of China. Avadomide (CC-122) has been differentiated from previous compounds (such as thalidomide, lenalidomide and pomalidomide) and has been developed based on the scientific understanding of Cereblon-mediated protein homeostasis. We have rights to develop and commercialize avadomide (CC-122) in China under our exclusive license agreement with Celgene. See “-Celgene Collaboration.”
Our Commercial Products
We commercialize the following cancer drugs in China under an exclusive license from Celgene. Historically, the fourth quarter sales of many oncology drug sales in China are lower than sales levels in the third quarter. Our product ABRAXANE®'s fourth quarter sales were lower than the third quarter in 2018.
ABRAXANE®
ABRAXANE® (paclitaxel albumin-bound particles for injectable suspension) is a solvent-free chemotherapy product which was developed using Celgene’s proprietary nab® technology platform. This protein-bound chemotherapy agent combines paclitaxel with albumin. Globally, ABRAXANE® is approved for uses in breast cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer and GC with geographic differences in labeling. In China, ABRAXANE® is approved for metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within six months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated.
According to Chen et al. 2016, there were approximately 4.3 million new cancer cases and 2.8 million cancer deaths in China in 2015, with breast cancer as the most common tumor type in Chinese women. It is estimated that in 2015 breast cancer affected 268,600 women and resulted in 69,500 deaths. Targeted therapy, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are three main strategies to treat different types of breast cancer.
Taxanes are the backbone chemotherapy to treat triple negative breast cancer, Her2+ or aggressive estrogen-receptor-positive and/or progesterone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients. ABRAXANE® is the only currently approved taxane that does not need pre-medication with dexamethasone to prevent hypersensitivity reactions, and several Phase 3 trials have 
18

demonstrated its efficacy and safety compared to solvent-based taxanes in both metastatic breast cancer and neo-adjuvant settings. Unlike other taxanes, ABRAXANE® has demonstrated unique and strong efficacy in pancreatic cancer and has become the backbone of first line standard of care for metastatic pancreatic cancer globally.
The taxanes marketed in China include two branded solvent-based paclitaxel (TAXOL® and ANZATAX) formulations, one branded docetaxel (TAXOTERE®) formulation, one paclitaxel liposome (LIPUSU®), one albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABRAXANE®) and dozens of generic taxanes. LIPUSU® is currently the market leader with approximately one-third of the market share.
In February 2018, an albumin-bound paclitaxel from CSPC Pharmaceutical Group was approved by the NMPA. Another form of albumin-bound paclitaxel from Hengrui was approved by the NMPA in September 2018.
In 2019, we plan to seek to differentiate and defend ABRAXANE® against growing generic competition in China, expand our sales force footprint and hospital coverage, and improve patient access through critical illness insurance negotiations and provincial reimbursement listings. As of September 1, 2018, ABRAXANE® is listed on provincial reimbursement drug lists of Fujian, Hubei, Ningxia, Jiangsu and Hunan, as well as in critical illness insurance program in Zhejiang and Shandong.
REVLIMID®
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is an oral immunomodulatory drug that was approved by the NMPA in China in 2013 for the treatment of multiple myeloma, or MM, in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. On February 2, 2018, REVLIMID® received NMPA approval of a new indication for the treatment of MM in combination with dexamethasone in adult patients with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for transplant.
MM is a malignant disease whose tumor cells originate in plasma cells in the bone marrow, which are cells in which B-lymphocytes develop to the final functional phase. The World Health Organization currently classifies it as a B-cell lymphoma, also known as plasma cell myeloma/plasmacytoma. MM is characterized by abnormal proliferation of bone marrow plasma cells accompanied by overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulin. MM is often accompanied by multiple osteolytic lesions, hypercalcemia, anemia, and kidney damage. Due to the inhibition of normal immunoglobulin production, patients are prone to a variety of bacterial infections.
At present, MM is one of the most common malignant tumors in the blood system and occurs frequently in the elderly. The actual incidence increases with age, peaking from 60 to 70 years of age. Men suffer slightly more than women. Globally, the incidence was estimated at two to three per 100,000, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.6:1, and most patients are over 40 years old, according to Siegel et al., 2011 and IMS analysis. It is estimated that the incidence rate of MM is approximately one to two per 100,000 people in China, or approximately 18,000 new patients in 2017, out of which 10,000 are in urban populations, according to Lu et al., 2014, IMS analysis, and local market research. With a growing aging population and improving diagnosis, China has seen a steady increase in MM incidence.
Although MM cannot be cured, the progression of the disease can be controlled. The purpose of treatment is to extend patients’ survival and improve quality of life. The main treatments for MM in China include VELCADE®, which is a proteasome inhibitor marketed by Johnson & Johnson in China since 2006, generic thalidomide and REVLIMID®. VELCADE® currently dominates the market in first-line MM treatment in China, while VELCADE® and REVLIMID® share the market in the second line. Chinese guidelines recommend lenalidomide as a standard of care for the treatment of R/R and newly diagnosed MM as well as in the maintenance setting. The first lenalidomide generic and first bortezomib generic in China were approved in November 2017. Another new agent for R/R MM, NINLARO® (ixazomib), an oral proteasome inhibitor developed by Takeda, received marketing approval from the NMPA on April 12, 2018. In February 2018, generic lenalidomide from ShuangLu Pharmaceutical Company was approved by the NMPA, and a third generic from Yangtze River is under review.
REVLIMID® was listed on the NRDL in June 2017.
VIDAZA®
VIDAZA® (azacitidine for injection) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog that has been shown to reverse the effects of DNA hypermethylation and promote subsequent gene re-expression. VIDAZA® was approved in China in April 2017 for the treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, chronic myelomonocyte leukemia, or CMML, and acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, with 20% to 30% blasts and multi-lineage dysplasia. In January 2018, VIDAZA® became commercially available in China.
19

MDS are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature and therefore do not become healthy blood cells. Approximately seven per 100,000 people are affected with approximately four per 100,000 people newly acquiring the condition each year globally according to Germing et al., 2013. The typical age of onset is 70 years. The higher-risk MDS (intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS) is considered fatal because the median overall survival rate is only 0.4-1.1 years and nearly 30% of these patients progress to AML, according to the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, MDS guideline 2013 and MDS Foundation. DNA methylation is an important mechanism of epigenetic gene regulation, but aberrant DNA hypermethylation can result in gene silencing. Silencing of tumor suppressor genes promotes cancer development and progression. MDS patients display aberrant DNA methylation of thousands of genes, which increases with advanced disease and is a poor prognostic factor.
In China, the main treatments for intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS are conventional care regimen, or CCR (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine and intensive chemotherapy), and hypomethylating agents, or HMAs. DACOGEN® (decitabine) marketed by Johnson & Johnson was the first HMA agent approved in China in 2009. In the past several years, at least six decitabine generics have become available. In 2017, decitabine was listed in the NRDL. Nevertheless, there are still over 50% of higher-risk MDS patients treated by CCR and the unmet need remains large.
VIDAZA® is the only approved HMA shown to prolong survival for patients with MDS. Besides reversing the effects of DNA hypermethylation, VIDAZA® inhibits protein synthesis via RNA incorporation. VIDAZA® is a Category 1 recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the U.S. NCCN guideline. It is also a first-line recommended treatment for patients with intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS, according to the Chinese MDS treatment guidelines, and was listed on the NRDL in October 2018.
Our Preclinical Programs
We have a proprietary cancer biology platform that has also allowed us to develop our clinical-stage drug candidates and several additional preclinical-stage drug candidates in potentially important areas. These currently consist of targeted therapies and immuno-oncology agents. We anticipate advancing one or more of our preclinical assets into the clinic in the next 12 months. We believe we have the opportunity to combine tislelizumab with our preclinical candidates to target multiple points in the cancer immunity cycle. We also may seek to develop companion diagnostics that will help identify patients who are most likely to benefit from the use of our drug candidates.
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently have manufacturing capabilities at our research and development center in Beijing and at our manufacturing site in Suzhou, China that may be used for process development and clinical-scale small molecule drugs and biologics, as well as commercial scale production of small molecule drugs at our Suzhou facility. We are also constructing a commercial-scale biologics facility in Guangzhou, China. However, we have not yet begun to manufacture or process, either on our own or through a third-party, our drug candidates on a commercial scale. We currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party contract research organization, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of raw materials and production of our drug candidates, as described below.
Raw Materials
We obtain raw materials for our manufacturing activities from multiple suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. Raw materials and starting materials used at our facilities in Beijing and Suzhou include active pharmaceutical ingredients custom-made by our CROs and excipients, which are commercially available from well-known vendors that meet the requirements of the relevant regulatory agencies. The core raw material to be used in manufacturing at our Guangzhou facility under construction is expected to be a genetically modified cell line that we co-developed and licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim.
We typically order raw materials on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. We pay for our purchases of raw materials on credit. Credit periods granted to us by our suppliers generally range from 30 to 60 days. Our suppliers are generally not responsible for the defects of our finished products.
Production
We have an approximately 11,000 square meter manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, where we produce small molecule and biologics drug candidates for clinical supply and which we plan to use for commercial supply of our small molecule drug candidates, if approved. This facility consists of one oral-solid-dosage production line for small molecule drug 
20

products and one pilot plant for monoclonal antibody drug substances. In January 2018, the facility received a manufacturing license from the Jiangsu Food and Drug Administration, which is required for the commercial manufacture of zanubrutinib in China following NDA approval.
In addition, we have formed a joint venture with Guangzhou GET Technology Development Co., Ltd., an affiliate of Guangzhou Development District, to build a 24,000-liter commercial-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Guangzhou, China. Approximately US$300 million in funding has been committed for the construction of the 100,000 square meter manufacturing site. We contracted with General Electric to acquire its state-of-the-art KUBio™ prefabricated biomanufacturing equipment and commenced construction in 2017. We expect the first phase of the facility to be completed in 2019, and, following regulatory inspection and approval, to be used for commercial-scale production of tislelizumab, if approved.
We also have an approximately 140-square meter manufacturing facility at our research and development facilities in Beijing, China, which produces preclinical and clinical trial materials for some of our small molecule drug candidates.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements governing recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our manufacturing facilities and the CMOs we use to manufacture our drugs and drug candidates operate under current good manufacturing practice regulations, or cGMP conditions. cGMP are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Contract Manufacturing Organizations
We outsource to a limited number of external contract manufacturers the production of some drug substances and drug products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical, clinical and potential commercial requirements of our drugs and drug candidates. We have adopted procedures to ensure that the production qualifications, facilities and processes of our third-party outsourced suppliers comply with the relevant regulatory requirements and our internal guidelines. We select our third-party suppliers carefully by considering a number of factors, including their qualifications, relevant expertise, production capacity, geographic proximity, reputation, track record, product quality, reliability in meeting delivery schedules, and terms offered by such third-party outsourced suppliers.
We have framework agreements with most of our external service providers, under which they generally provide services to us on a short-term and project-by-project basis. For example, we have an agreement with a contract manufacturer for clinical supply of zanubrutinib and expect to enter into a commercial supply agreement for zanubrutinib in the future. We have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals (China) Ltd., or Boehringer Ingelheim, for our investigational anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, tislelizumab, which will be manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim’s facility in Shanghai, China as part of a marketing authorization holder, or MAH, trial project pioneered by us and Boehringer Ingelheim. We believe the MAH status will be maintained after the expiration of the MAH pilot program in November 2019, based on confirmation from the relevant governmental authority, and therefore we believe that the expiration of the MAH pilot program will not impact our drug candidates. Under the terms of the commercial supply agreement, Boehringer Ingelheim will manufacture tislelizumab in China under an exclusive multi-year arrangement, with contract extension possible. In addition, we obtained certain preferred rights for future capacity expansion by Boehringer Ingelheim in China. For our commercial products licensed from Celgene, we rely on Celgene and its contract manufacturers outside of China for the supply of those drugs.
Agreements with outsourced suppliers generally set out terms, including product quality or service details, technical standards or methods, delivery terms, agreed price and payment, and product inspection and acceptance criteria. We are generally allowed to return any products that fail to meet our quality standards. Our outsourced suppliers procure raw materials themselves. Typically, outsourced suppliers request settlement of payment within 30 days from the date of invoice. Either party may terminate the agreements by serving notice to the other party under certain circumstances.
Celgene Collaboration
Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement
On July 5, 2017, we entered into an Exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement, as amended and restated, with Celgene and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Celgene Switzerland LLC, or Celgene Switzerland, which became effective on August 31, 2017, pursuant to which we granted the Celgene parties an exclusive right to develop and commercialize tislelizumab in all fields of treatment, other than hematology, in the United States, Europe, Japan and the rest of world other than Asia, which we refer to as the PD-1 License Agreement.
21

Pursuant to the terms of the PD-1 License Agreement, the Celgene parties made upfront payments of US$263 million to us. In addition, pursuant to a share subscription agreement with Celgene Switzerland dated July 5, 2017, or the Share Subscription Agreement, we issued approximately 32.7 million of our ordinary shares on August 31, 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of US$150 million at $4.58 per ordinary share, or $59.55 per ADS, representing a 35% premium to an 11-day volume-weighted average price of our ADSs. The agreement also provides for up to US$980 million in potential development, regulatory and sales milestone payments and tiered royalties based on percentages of annual net sales, depending on specified terms, in the low double digit to mid-twenties, with customary reductions in specified circumstances. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of the last valid patent claim, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, or 12 years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in the country of sale.
Each party has the right to develop and commercialize tislelizumab in its respective field and territory, and has also agreed to collaborate through a joint steering committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party on, among other things, the conduct of up to eight global pivotal clinical trials, or the Basket Studies. Each Basket Study will be conducted and funded by either us or Celgene in accordance with a mutually agreed development plan and study design. For any Basket Studies conducted and funded by us, Celgene has the right to opt into such program, at which time it will reimburse us for agreed upon development costs based on a multiple of such costs that varies according to the stage of development at which Celgene opts into the program. Celgene has committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop at least one licensed product, to seek specified regulatory approvals and to spend at least US$100 million on development for the Basket Studies led by Celgene, subject to specified conditions. In addition, we retain the right to develop tislelizumab in combination therapies with our portfolio compounds, and Celgene has a right of first negotiation for tislelizumab in the hematology field and in our territory, subject to specified conditions.
The PD-1 License Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us and Celgene. Unless earlier terminated, the agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the royalty term in such country for such licensed product. The agreement may be terminated by Celgene upon 30 days’ prior written notice, or by either party upon the other party’s bankruptcy or uncured material breach. In addition, the agreement includes standard exclusivity obligations and provisions that are triggered in the event that Celgene acquires or is acquired by a third party with a competing product.
In January 2019, Celgene and Bristol-Myers Squibb, or BMS, announced the proposed acquisition of Celgene by BMS, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019, subject to receipt of required approvals. BMS markets the anti-PD-1 inhibitor OPDIVO® (nivolumab). Assuming that the BMS-Celgene transaction closes, we expect that a likely outcome will be that the PD-1 License Agreement will be terminated under the exclusivity and related provisions, and we will regain the full rights to tislelizumab with a termination fee from Celgene. Prior to that time, we expect to continue to conduct the agreed upon development plans under the existing terms of the agreement, including receipt from Celgene of development funding for the Basket Studies that it has agreed to fund. In the event that the PD-1 License Agreement is terminated, we believe that we are operationally and financially capable of continuing to advance tislelizumab on our own with minimal disruption. 
Celgene China Agreements
On July 5, 2017, we and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene, Celgene Logistics Sàrl, or Celgene Logistics, entered into a License and Supply Agreement, which we refer to as the China License Agreement and which became effective on August 31, 2017, pursuant to which we were granted the right to exclusively distribute and promote Celgene’s approved cancer therapies, ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID® and VIDAZA®, and its investigational agent avadomide (CC-122) in clinical development in China, excluding Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. In addition, if Celgene decides to commercialize a new oncology product through a third-party in the licensed territory during the first five years of the term, we have a right of first negotiation to obtain the right to commercialize the product, subject to certain conditions. We paid an aggregate of US$4.5 million in cash for the license and our acquisition of Celgene Shanghai, as described below.
The term of the China License Agreement is 10 years and may be terminated by either party upon written notice in the event of uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party, or if the underlying regulatory approvals for the covered products are revoked. Celgene Logistics also has the right to terminate the agreement with respect to REVLIMID® at any time upon written notice to the Company under certain circumstances.
In the event of an acquisition of Celgene Logistics by another party, the China License Agreement provides that Celgene Logistics shall provide notice to us, and within a specified period of time, requires that the parties discuss in good faith any changes in the supply requirements of the China License Agreement that Celgene Logistics may request as a result of the acquisition. During that period, the China License Agreement requires us to conduct business in the ordinary course and provides that Celgene Logistics is not required to supply more than a specified amount more than the amount of our forecasted 
22

demand. We expect to be able to continue to market ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID® and VIDAZA® in China under the China License Agreement following the closing of the announced BMS acquisition of Celgene, if that transaction occurs.
The China License Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and confidentiality and mutual indemnification provisions.
On August 31, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary, BeiGene (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd., acquired 100% of the equity interests of Celgene Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Celgene Shanghai, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Holdings East Corporation established under the laws of China. The purchase price of Celgene Shanghai was determined to be approximately US$28.1 million from an accounting perspective, and comprised of a cash consideration of US$4.5 million and non-cash consideration of US$23.6 million. The amount allocated to non-cash consideration, related to the discount on ordinary shares issued to Celgene in connection with the Share Subscription Agreement and was a result of the increase in fair value of our shares between the fixed price of US$59.55 per ADS specified in the Share Subscription Agreement and the fair value per ADS on August 31, 2017, the date the transaction closed. This company, which we subsequently renamed BeiGene Pharmaceutical (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., is in the business of, among other things, providing marketing and promotional services for the pharmaceutical products that we license from Celgene. Prior to closing, Celgene separated out certain business functions, including regulatory and drug safety, that continue to support the business acquired by us.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and their methods of use are an important part of our strategy to develop and commercialize novel medicines, as described in more detail below. We have obtained patents and filed patent applications in the United States and other countries and regions, such as China and Europe, relating to certain of our drug candidates, and are pursuing additional patent protection for them and for our other drug candidates and technologies. We rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection including our manufacturing processes. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and support our development programs.
As of February 11, 2019, we owned 18 issued U.S. patents, 10 issued China patents, a number of pending U.S. and China patent applications, and corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, we owned pending international patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, which we plan to file nationally in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as additional priority PCT applications. With respect to any issued patents in the United States and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date, provided that we meet the applicable requirements for obtaining such patent term extensions. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a drug product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time that we spend in clinical studies as well as getting approval from the FDA.
The patent portfolios for our later-stage clinical drug candidates as of February 11, 2019, are summarized below:
Zanubrutinib. We own two issued U.S. patents, one issued China patent, a number of pending PCT and U.S. patent applications, and corresponding patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to zanubrutinib, a small molecule BTK inhibitor, combinations of zanubrutinib with other therapeutic agents, and its use for the treatment of hematological malignancies or autoimmune disease. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents and the issued China patent is 2034, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
Tislelizumab. We own three issued U.S. patents, one issued China patent, pending PCT, U.S. and China patent applications, and corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to tislelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, and its use for the treatment of cancer. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents and the issued China patent is 2033, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
Pamiparib. We own three issued U.S. patents, one issued China patent, a number of pending PCT, U.S. and China patent applications, and corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to pamiparib, a small molecule PARP1/2 inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including glioblastomas and breast cancer. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents and the issued China patent is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
23

Lifirafenib. We own two issued U.S. patents, two issued China patents, a number of pending PCT, U.S. and China patent applications, and corresponding pending patent applications in other jurisdictions directed to lifirafenib, a small molecule BRAF inhibitor, and its use for the treatment of cancer, including BRAF mutated cancers. The expected expiration for the issued U.S. patents and the issued China patents is 2031, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. We intend to pursue marketing exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.
The patent portfolios for our three in-licensed commercial products in China are summarized below:
ABRAXANE®. We are the exclusive licensee of five issued Chinese patents and a number of pending Chinese patent applications directed to ABRAXANE®, a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, covering its composition, liquid formulation, and use for the treatment of cancer. Two of the five issued Chinese patents expired in 2018. The expected expirations for the other three issued Chinese patents are 2021, 2026 and 2031, respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. However, generic versions of albumin-bound palclitaxel have been approved in China and are being commercialized.
REVLIMID®. We are the exclusive licensee of seven issued Chinese patents directed to REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), covering its use for the treatment of cancer, including MM. The expected expirations for the issued Chinese patents are 2023 and 2027, respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term extensions. However, generic versions of lenalidomide have been approved in China and are being commercialized.
VIDAZA®. We do not have any rights in any issued China patent or pending China patent applications directed to VIDAZA®, a chemical analog of cytidine, and its use for the treatment of cancer. We are aware of third parties who are seeking to develop and obtain approval for generic forms of this drug.
Furthermore, although various extensions may be available, the life of a patent and the protection it affords, is limited. As noted above, ABRAXANE®, REVLIMID® and VIDAZA® face or are expected to face competition from generic medications, and we may face similar competition for any approved drug candidates even if we successfully obtain patent protection once the patent life has expired for the drug. The scope, validity or enforceability of our patents may be challenged in court, and we may not be successful in enforcing or defending those intellectual property rights and, as a result, may not be able to develop or market the relevant product exclusively, which would have a material adverse effect on any potential sales of that product. Under our license agreement with Celgene, Celgene retains the responsibility for, but is not obligated, to prosecute, defend and enforce the patents for these in-licensed products. As such, any issued patents may not protect us from generic competition for these drugs.
The term of individual patents may vary based on the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States and China, the term of an issued patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened in some cases by a patent term adjustment, which extends the term of a patent to account for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in excess of a patent applicant’s own delays during the prosecution process, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent having an earlier expiration date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval.
In certain foreign jurisdictions similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are also available. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim and country by country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of any patent term extensions or adjustments, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect aspects of our technology. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Additionally, we currently own a number of registered trademarks and pending trademark applications. We currently have registered trademarks for BeiGene and our corporate logo in China, the European Union and other jurisdictions and are seeking trademark protection for BeiGene, our corporate logo, product names and logos, and other marks in the United States and other countries where available and appropriate.

Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research and clinical development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, pricing and export and import of drugs such as those we are developing and commercializing. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Regulation
U.S. Government Regulation and Product Approval
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA, its implementing regulations, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations.
Cancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first line, second line or third line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for second or third line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first line therapy is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Whenever first line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of these, proves unsuccessful, second line therapy may be administered. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor targeted small molecule drugs or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include bone marrow transplantation, antibody and small molecule targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery and new technologies.
U.S. Drug Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, for the intended use;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA for a drug or a BLA for a biologic;


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP;


• | FDA audits of some clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCPs; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or licensing of the BLA.

Once a product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to the proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding 
25

concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or noncompliance and may be imposed on all products within a certain class of products. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be filed with the FDA as an IND amendment and submitted to the IRBs for approval.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 


• | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population. These clinical trials are intended to evaluate the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

We refer to our Phase 1 programs as dose-escalation and dose-expansion trials. In addition, we refer to some of our Phase 2 programs as pivotal or registrational programs, where the results can be used to support regulatory approval in specific jurisdictions without the need to conduct a Phase 3 trial.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected AEs, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product drug. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an 
26

NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug product program fee.
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, and a BLA to determine whether the biologic is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use. The FDA also evaluates whether the product’s manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA or BLA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also approve an NDA or BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities in certain jurisdictions, and in the United States by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. We are developing combination products using our own drug candidates and third-party drugs.
Expedited Programs
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs, including biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request the FDA to designate the drug as a fast track product concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available 
27

if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of each portion of the NDA or BLA and the applicant pays the applicable user fee. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Accelerated Approval
Under FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a biologic, for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement or clinical signs of a disease or condition that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post-approval clinical trials sometimes referred to as Phase 4 trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
Breakthrough Designation
Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A drug or biologic product can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a product be designated as a breakthrough therapy concurrently with, or at any time after, the submission of an IND, and the FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. If so designated, the FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with the sponsor throughout the product’s development, providing timely advice to the sponsor to ensure that the development program to gather preclinical and clinical data is as efficient as practicable, involving senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, and assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor. The designation may be rescinded if the drug candidate does not continue to meet the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation.
Priority Review
The FDA may grant an NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by 
28

the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory requirements and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval or revoke a biologics license if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, untitled or warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. We may undertake or be required to undertake a product recall.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity or patent periods.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The PHSA includes an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
29

A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to drugs, including biologics, intended to treat a rare disease or condition-generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the product for the indication can be recovered by sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA.
After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease or condition with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product to the product with orphan drug exclusivity through a demonstration of superior safety, superior efficacy, or a major contribution to patient care. “Same drug” means a drug that contains the same active moiety if it is a drug composed of small molecules, or the same principal molecular structural features if it is composed of macromolecules and is intended for the same use as a previously approved drug, except that if the subsequent drug can be shown to be clinically superior to the first drug, it will not be considered to be the same drug. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
Zanubrutinib was granted ODD status by the FDA for the treatment of WM, CLL and MCL on June 29, 2016, July 20, 2016, and June 23, 2016, respectively.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective or medically-necessary compared to other available therapies, 
30

they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
The current U.S. president's administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains further drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Additionally, the current administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same time, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. For example, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019, and in October 2018, CMS proposed a new rule that would require direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product. In addition, CMS issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or ANPRM, in October 2018 indicating it is considering issuing a proposed rule in the spring of 2019 on a model called the International Pricing Index, or IPI. This model would utilize a basket of other countries’ prices as a reference for the Medicare program to use in reimbursing for drugs covered under Part B. The ANPRM also included an updated version of the Competitive Acquisition Program, or CAP, as an alternative to current “buy and bill” payment methods for Part B drugs. Such a proposed rule could limit our product pricing and have material adverse effects on our business. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
If we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business prior to and after receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;


• | federal civil and criminal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government

31

may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates who perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.

The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, some of which apply to claims for, and referral of patients for, healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Similarly, state privacy laws may be broader and require greater protections than HIPAA.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the European Union are governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive and GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive, the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduces new data protection requirements in the European Union and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

PRC Regulation
In the People's Republic of China, or PRC, we operate in an increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment. We are subject to a variety of PRC laws, rules and regulations affecting many aspects of our business. This section summarizes the principal PRC laws, rules and regulations that we believe are relevant to our business and operations.
PRC Drug Regulation
Introduction
China heavily regulates the development, approval, manufacturing and distribution of drugs, including biologics. The specific regulatory requirements applicable depend on whether the drug is made and finished in China, which is referred to as a domestically manufactured drug, or made abroad and imported into China in finished form, which is referred to as an imported drug, as well as the approval or “registration” category of the drug. For both imported and domestically manufactured drugs, China typically requires regulatory approval for a clinical trial, or CTA, prior to submitting an application for marketing approval. For a domestically manufactured drug, there is also a requirement to have a drug manufacturing license for a facility in China.
In 2017, the drug regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform. The State Council and the China Communist Party jointly issued the Opinion on Deepening the Reform of the Regulatory Approval System to Encourage Innovation in Drugs and Medical Devices, or the Innovation Opinion. The expedited programs and other advantages under this and other recent reforms encourage drug manufacturers to seek marketing approval in China first, manufacture domestically, and develop drugs in high priority disease areas, such as oncology.
To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the NMPA has been revising the fundamental laws, regulations and rules regulating pharmaceutical products and the industry, which include the framework law known as the PRC Drug Administration Law, or DAL. The DAL is also generally implemented by a set of regulations issued by the State Council referred to as the DAL Implementing Regulation. The NMPA has its own set of regulations implementing the DAL; the primary one governing clinical trial applications, marketing approval, and license renewal and amendment is known as the Drug Registration Regulation. Although the NMPA made progress in 2018 on different proposals, finalizing several guidelines and documents, as of January 2019 final implementing regulations for many of the reforms in the Innovation Opinion had not been announced, and therefore, the details regarding the implementation of the regulatory changes remained uncertain in some respects.
Regulatory Authorities and Recent Government Reorganization
In the PRC, the NMPA is the primary regulator for pharmaceutical products and businesses. The agency was newly formed from the prior China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, in 2018 as part of a complete government reorganization. NMPA is no longer an independent agency. Its parent agency is now the newly organized State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), into which agencies responsible for, among other areas, consumer protection, advertising, anticorruption, pricing, fair competition and intellectual property have been merged.
Like the CFDA, the NMPA is still the chief drug regulatory agency and implements the same laws, regulations, rules, and guidelines as the CFDA, and it regulates almost all of the key stages of the life-cycle of pharmaceutical products, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, marketing approvals, manufacturing, advertising and promotion, distribution, and pharmacovigilance (i.e., post-marketing safety reporting obligations). The Center for Drug Evaluation, or CDE, which remains under the NMPA, conducts the technical evaluation of each drug and biologic application for safety and effectiveness.
The National Health Commission, or NHC, (formerly known by the names: the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC)), is China’s chief healthcare regulator. It is primarily responsible for overseeing the operation of medical institutions, which also serve as clinical trial sites, and regulating the licensure of hospitals and other medical personnel. NHC plays a significant role in drug reimbursement. Furthermore, the NHC and its local counterparts at or below the provincial-level of local government also oversee and organize public medical institutions’ centralized bidding and procurement process for pharmaceutical products. This is the chief way that public hospitals and their internal pharmacies acquire drugs.
Also, as part of the 2018 reorganization, the PRC government formed a new State Medical Insurance Bureau which focuses on regulating reimbursement under the state-sponsored insurance plans.
33

Preclinical and Clinical Development
The NMPA requires preclinical data to support registration applications for imported and domestic drugs. Preclinical work, including pharmacology and toxicology studies, must meet the GLP, issued in July 2017. The NMPA accredits GLP labs and requires that nonclinical studies on chemical drug substances and preparations and biologics that are not yet marketed in China be conducted there. There are no approvals required from the NMPA to conduct preclinical studies.
Registration Categories
Prior to engaging with the NMPA on research and development and approval, an applicant will need to determine the registration category for its drug candidate (which will ultimately need to be confirmed with the NMPA), which will determine the requirements for its clinical trial and marketing application. There are five categories for small molecule drugs: Category 1 (“innovative drugs”) refers to drugs that have a new chemical entity that has not been marketed anywhere in the world, Category 2 (“improved new drugs”) refers to drugs with a new indication, dosage form, route of administration, combination, or certain formulation changes not approved in the world, Categories 3 and 4 are for generics that reference an innovator drug (or certain well-known generic drugs) marketed either abroad or in China, respectively, and Category 5 refers to innovative or generic drugs that have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in China (i.e., many imported drugs).
Therapeutic biologics follow a similar categorization, with Category 1 being new to the world, but with fifteen product-specific categories. Like with small molecule drugs, Category 1 is for innovative biologics that have not been approved inside or outside of China. A clear regulatory pathway for biosimilars does not yet exist, but something was proposed in a draft revision to an NMPA regulation in 2017. Each of zanubrutinib, tislelizumab, pamiparib and lifirafenib is classified as Category 1 based on the respective clinical trial approval from the NMPA, which is a favored category for CTA and marketing approval.
Expedited Programs
Priority Evaluation and Approval Programs to Encourage Innovation
The NMPA has adopted several expedited review and approval mechanisms since 2009 and created additional expedited programs in recent years that are intended to encourage innovation. Applications for these expedited programs can be submitted after the CTA is admitted for review by the CDE. Some of the current categories of drugs eligible for priority status that may be particularly relevant for us include: (1) Category 1 innovative drugs that have not been approved inside or outside of China; (2) oncology drugs; (3) drugs using advanced technology, innovative treatment methods, and having clear therapeutic benefit; and (4) new drugs for which clinical trials are already approved in the United States or European Union, or for which marketing authorization applications have been filed simultaneously in China and in the United States or European Union and are manufactured in China using the same production line that passed FDA or EMA inspection.
If admitted to one of these expedited programs, an applicant will be entitled to more frequent and timely communication with reviewers at the CDE, expedited review and approval, and more agency resources throughout the approval process. Each of our drug candidates, zanubrutinib, tislelizumab, pamiparib and lifirafenib, is classified as Category 1 based on the respective clinical trial approval from the NMPA.
NMPA also permits conditional approval of certain medicines based on early phase data. Post-approval the applicant may need to conduct a post-market study. The agency has done this for drugs that meet unmet clinical needs for life-threatening illnesses and also for drugs that treat orphan indications. In 2018, NMPA established a conditional approval program for drugs designated by the CDE that have been approved in the US, EU and Japan within the last 10 years and that meet one of three criteria (1) orphan indications, (2) drugs that treat life threatening illnesses for which there are not effective treatment or preventive methods, and (3) drugs that treat life threatening illnesses and that have a clear clinical advantage over other clinical therapies.
CDE Guideline on PD-1/L1 NDA
In addition to the programs and proposals above, the CDE has recently stated that it will permit applicants for PD-1/L1 agents to submit data on a rolling basis based on the current high unmet medical need for PD-1/L1 agents. In February 2018, the CDE released the Guideline on the Basic Requirements of Information and Data for NDA Submissions of anti-PD-1/L1 Monoclonal Antibody Products on recurrent and refractory advanced cancers without standard-of-care therapies. Under the guideline, the sponsor must have a pre-NDA meeting with the CDE regarding the data and the NDA submission. The CDE will permit the following submission for these applicants: (1) an initial NDA submission with full preliminary safety data and effectiveness data, including the results of at least two independent therapeutic efficacy assessments of all patients who are 
34

currently enrolled pursuant to all of the protocol’s requirements; (2) during the CDE’s substantive technical review of the NDA, submission on a rolling basis of follow-up safety and effectiveness data from at least six months from the time of the last enrolled patient showing the duration of the response; and (3) submission of all efficacy and safety data as provided for under the protocol before final approval is granted by the NMPA. Sponsors may also apply for priority review and approval for their NDA to accelerate the progress. If granted, priority status will be applied to various stages of the approval process, including testing, manufacturing site inspection, technical review, and clinical site inspection.
New Policies on Expediting Approval of Imported Oncology Drugs
The PRC government continues to establish measures and incentives to promote the development and swifter approval of marketing for oncology and other innovative drugs. Beginning in May 2018, the PRC eliminated tariffs on a significant number of imported innovative drugs, including oncology drugs, making the importation process more efficient. The PRC government has also stated that it will explore ways to expand access to reimbursement under the state health plans for innovative drugs (particularly for urgently needed oncology drugs).
Clinical Trials and Marketing Approval
Upon completion of preclinical studies, a sponsor typically needs to conduct clinical trials in China for registering a new drug. The materials required for this application and the data requirements are determined by the registration category. The NMPA has taken a number of steps to increase efficiency for approving CTAs, and it has also significantly increased monitoring and enforcement of GCP to ensure data integrity.
 Trial Approval
All clinical trials conducted in China must be approved and conducted at hospitals accredited by the NMPA. For imported drugs, proof of foreign approval is required prior to the trial, unless the drug has never been approved anywhere in the world. In addition to a standalone China trial to support development, imported drug applicants may establish a site in China that is part of an international multicenter trial, or IMCT, at the outset of the global trial. Domestically manufactured drugs are not subject to foreign approval requirements, and in contrast to prior practice, the NMPA has recently decided to permit those drugs to conduct development via an IMCT as well.
In 2015, the NMPA began to issue an umbrella approval for all phases (typically three) of a new drug clinical trial, instead of issuing approval phase by phase. For certain types of new drug candidates, clinical trial applications may be prioritized over other applications, and put in a separate expedited queue for approval. Category 1 drugs are new drug trials which would qualify for this expedited umbrella approval status. Other trials that are not part of these expedited lines could still wait up to a year for approval to conduct the trial.
The NMPA has now also adopted a notification system for clinical trials of new drugs. Trials can proceed if after 60 business days, the applicant has not received any objections from the CDE, as opposed to the lengthier previous clinical trial pre-approval process in which the applicant had to wait for affirmative approval. China is also expanding the number of trial sites by truncating the timeline for accreditation by converting it from a pre-approval procedure into a notification procedure.
Human Genetic Resources Approval
According to the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources, an additional approval is required for any foreign companies or foreign affiliates that conduct trials in China. Prior to entering into a clinical trial agreement and beginning a trial, the foreign sponsor and the Chinese clinical trial site are required to obtain human genetic resources, or HGR, approval to collect any biological samples that contain the genetic material of Chinese human subjects from the Ministry of Science and Technology, and any cross-border transfer of the samples or associated data requires additional approval. Furthermore, one of the key review points for the HGR review and approval process is the IP sharing arrangement between Chinese and foreign parties. The parties are required to share patent rights to inventions arising from the samples. Conducting a clinical trial in China without obtaining the relevant HGR preapproval will subject the sponsor and trial site to administrative liability, including confiscation of HGR samples and associated data, and administrative fines.
35

Trial Exemptions and Acceptance of Foreign Data
The NMPA may reduce requirements for trials and data, depending on the drug and the existing data. The NMPA has granted waivers for all or part of trials, and has stated that it will accept data generated abroad (even if not part of a global study), including early phase data, that meets its requirements. On July 6, 2018, the NMPA issued the Technical Guidance Principles on Accepting Foreign Drug Clinical Trial Data, or the Guidance Principles, as one of the implementing rules for the Innovation Opinion. According to the Guidance Principles, the data of foreign clinical trials must meet the authenticity, completeness and accuracy requirements and such data must be obtained consistent with the relevant requirements under the Good Clinical Trial Practice (GCP) of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). Sponsors must be attentive to potentially meaningful ethnic differences in the subject population.
The NMPA now officially permits, and its predecessor agencies have permitted on a case-by-case basis in the past, drugs approved outside of China to be approved in China on a conditional basis without the need for pre-approval clinical trials inside China. Specifically, in 2018, the NMPA established a program permitting drugs that have been approved within the last ten years in the United States, EU or Japan and that i) prevent or treat orphan diseases, ii) prevent or treat serious life-threatening illnesses for which there is either no effective therapy in China, or for which the foreign-approved drug would have clear clinical advantages. Applicants will be required to establish a risk mitigation plan and may be required to complete trials in China after the drug is marketed. The CDE has developed a list of qualifying drugs that meet this criteria.
Clinical Trial Process and Good Clinical Practices
Typically drug clinical trials in China have three phases. Phase 1 refers to the initial clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. Phase 2 refers to the preliminary evaluation of a drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety for target indication(s) in patients. Phase 3 (often the pivotal study) refers to clinical trials to further verify the drug candidate’s therapeutic efficacy and safety on patients with target indication(s) and ultimately provide sufficient evidence for the review of a drug registration application. The NMPA requires that the different phases of clinical trials in China receive ethics committee approval prior to approval of the CTA and comply with GCP. The NMPA conducts inspections to assess GCP compliance and will cancel the CTA if it finds substantial issues.
Generic small molecule drugs are required to conduct a bioequivalence trial, in vitro studies or in some cases a clinical trial to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to an innovator drug marketed either in China or abroad or an internationally accepted generic drug. The NMPA has released catalogues of reference products, and it released a first installment of a Marketed Drug List (China’s “Orange Book”) with information about drugs that may serve as reference products.
New Drug Application (NDA) and Approval
Upon completion of clinical trials, a sponsor may submit clinical trial data to support marketing approval for the drug. For imported drugs, this means issuance of an import license. Again, the applicant must submit evidence of foreign approval, unless it is an innovative drug that has never been approved anywhere in the world.
NDA sponsors must submit data derived from domestically manufactured drugs in support of a drug approval. Under the current regime, upon approval of the registration application, the NMPA will first issue a new drug certificate to the applicant. Only when the applicant is equipped with relevant manufacturing capability will the NMPA issue a Drug Approval Serial Number, which is effectively the marketing approval allowing the holder to market/commercialize the drug in China.
China has recently implemented a Drug Marketing Authorization Holder Mechanism. The MAH pilot program permits research institutions and individual entities to develop and hold the marketing approvals for drugs without holding a drug manufacturing license. Domestically established research institutions (including domestic companies) can apply through an MAH pilot program if they are established in one of 10 designated provinces (including Beijing and Shanghai), which is now being expanded nationwide in China. The MAHs may engage contract manufacturers and distributors.
The MAH program was originally set up as a pilot program until November 2018. China has now that stated it will expand the program nationwide and make it permanent. Implementing legislation has been proposed, and the MAH pilot has been renewed for one more year until November 2019 in the interim. The Innovation Opinion indicates that China will strive to implement the MAH system nationally as soon as possible by amending the DAL. The NMPA has proposed revisions to accomplish this purpose, but the timeline to finalize these proposals is still unclear.
36

Manufacturing and Distribution
According to the DAL, all facilities that make drugs in China must receive a drug manufacturing license with an appropriate “scope of manufacturing” from the local drug regulatory authority. This license must be renewed every five years. A separate certification of compliance with GMP is also required.
Similarly, to conduct sales, importation, shipping and storage (“distribution activities”) a company must obtain a Drug Distribution License from the local drug regulatory authority, subject to renewal every five years. Like with GMPs, a separate certification of compliance with NMPA’s drug good supply practice, or GSP, is required.
China has formed a “Two Invoice System” to control distribution of prescription drugs. The “Two-Invoice System” generally requires that no more than two invoices may be issued throughout the distribution chain, with one from the manufacturer to a distributor and another from the distributor to the end-user hospital. This excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly owned or controlled distributors, or for imported drugs, to their exclusive distributor, or from a distributor to its wholly owned or controlled subsidiary (or between the wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries). However, the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in China. Compliance with the Two-Invoice System will become a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in procurement processes with public hospitals, which currently provide most of China’s healthcare. Manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the Two-Invoice System may lose their qualifications to participate in the bidding process. Non-compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to public hospitals in a locality.
The Two-Invoice System was first implemented in 11 provinces that are involved in pilot comprehensive medical reforms, but the program has expanded to nearly all provinces, which have their own individual rules for the program.
Post-Marketing Surveillance
The manufacturer or marketing authorization holder of a drug is primarily responsible for pharmacovigilance, including quality assurance, adverse reaction reporting and monitoring, and product recalls. Distributors and user entities (e.g., hospitals) are also required to report, in their respective roles, adverse reactions of the products they sell or use, and assist with the manufacturer of the product recall. A drug that is currently under the new drug monitoring period has to report all adverse drug reactions (as opposed to just serious adverse reactions) for that period.
Advertising and Promotion of Pharmaceutical Products
China has a strict regime for the advertising of approved medicines. No unapproved medicines may be advertised. The definition of an advertisement is very broad, and does not exclude scientific exchange. It can be any media that directly or indirectly introduces the product to end users. There is no clear line between advertising and any other type of promotion.
An enterprise seeking to advertise a prescription drug may do so only in medical journals jointly approved by NMPA and the NHC, and each advertisement requires approval from a local drug regulatory authority. The content of an approved advertisement may not be altered without filing a new application for approval.
Prescription drug advertisements are subject to strict content restrictions, which prohibit recommendations by doctors and hospitals and guarantees of effectiveness. Advertising that includes content that is outside of the drug’s approval documentation (“off-label content”) is prohibited. False advertising can result in civil suits from end users and administrative liability, including fines. In addition to advertisements, non-promotional websites that convey information about a drug must go through a separate approval process by a local drug regulatory authority.
Regulatory Intellectual Property Protections
Non-patent exclusivities
New Drug Monitoring Period
Currently, new varieties of domestically produced drugs approved under Categories 1 or 2 in China may be placed under a monitoring period for three to five years. Category 1 innovative drugs will be monitored for five years. During the monitoring period, the NMPA will not approve another CTA from another applicant for the same type of drug, except if another sponsor 
37

has an approved CTA at the time that the monitoring period is initiated it may proceed with its trial and once approved become another drug that is part of the monitoring period. 
Regulatory Data Protection 
The Innovation Opinion also lays the foundation for the establishment of a system for regulatory data protection to protect innovators. This protection will be available to the undisclosed clinical trial data of drugs falling into the following categories: innovative drugs, innovative therapeutic biologics, drugs that treat orphan diseases, pediatric drugs, and drugs for which there has been a successful patent challenge. 
NMPA published a draft on Implementing Regulations for Pharmaceutical Study Data Protection for public comment that would set regulatory data protection for innovative small molecule drugs at six years and for innovative therapeutic biologics at 12 years; pediatric and orphan drugs would receive six years to run concurrently from their approval dates. Full terms of protection would require reliance on local trials or sites of multi-center trials in China and simultaneous submissions of marketing applications in China and other countries. Submissions in China that are up to six years later than those abroad would result in the term being reduced to 1-5 years. Submissions over six years later in China may not receive protection.
There is also a reduction if the marketing application is filed in China based solely on overseas clinical data with no Chinese subjects (75% reduction) or based on supplemental “China clinical trial data” (50% reduction). Information about the exclusivity term will be included in a Marketed Drug List (similar to the Orange Book in the US) at the time of approval. Some mechanics of these proposed rules are not yet clear, and it is not certain when the proposed rules will be finalized.
Patent-Related Protections 
Patent Linkage
The Innovation Opinion also sets forth the basic elements of a patent linkage system to protect innovators, in which a follow-on applicant will be required to specify patents that are relevant to its application and notify relevant patent holders (including, innovators) within a specified period after filing its application, permitting them to sue to protect their rights. The system will require that the NMPA continue to review the potentially infringing follow-on application during any lawsuit by the innovator. However, the NMPA may not approve the follow-on application pending resolution of the patent litigation in favor of the follow-on application or for a specified period of time, whichever is shorter. This reform will require implementing regulations. To date, the NMPA has not issued the relevant implementing regulations.
Patent Term Extension
In early 2019, pursuant to the Innovation Opinion, the National People’s Congress issued a proposal for patent term extension as part of a proposed amendment to the Patent Law. Under this proposal, the State Council may grant a patent term extension of up to five years to compensate for delays in the review process for innovative drugs that are applying simultaneously for marketing approval in both China and abroad. The patent term may not be extended to more than 14 years post-marketing. It is not clear when this will be finalized.
Reimbursement and Pricing
China’s national medical insurance program was adopted pursuant to the Decision of the State Council on the Establishment of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance Program issued by the State Council in 1998, under which all employers in urban cities are required to enroll their employees in the basic medical insurance program. The insurance premium is jointly contributed by the employers and employees. In 2007, the State Council promulgated Guiding Opinions of the State Council about the Pilot Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance , under which urban residents of the pilot district, rather than urban employees, may voluntarily join Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance. Participants of the national medical insurance program and their employers, if any, are required to contribute to the payment of insurance premiums on a monthly basis. Program participants are eligible for full or partial reimbursement of the cost of medicines included in the National Reimbursement Drug List, or NRDL. A pharmaceutical product listed in the NRDL must be clinically needed, safe, effective, reasonably priced, easy to use, and available in sufficient quantity.
Factors that affect the inclusion of a pharmaceutical product in the NRDL include whether the product is consumed in large volumes and commonly prescribed for clinical use in the PRC and whether it is considered to be important in meeting the basic healthcare needs of the general public. Since 2016, special consideration has been given to, among others, innovative drugs with high clinical value and drugs for serious diseases. In addition, the PRC Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security

has also been negotiating with manufacturers of expensive drugs with high clinical demands and proven effectiveness for price cuts in exchange for inclusion into the NRDL. The version of the NRDL released in 2017 covers 2,535 drugs in total, including 339 new additions, with an emphasis on innovative drugs and drugs that treat cancer and other serious diseases. China has been pursuing a policy of expediting the addition of innovative oncology drugs to this list. In 2018, 17 more oncology drugs were added into the NRDL by the State Medical Insurance Bureau.
Government price controls
The Chinese government has abolished the 15-year-old government-led pricing system for drugs, and lifted the maximum retail price for most drugs, including drugs reimbursed by government medical insurance funds, patented drugs, and some other drugs. The government regulates prices mainly by establishing a consolidated procurement mechanism, restructuring medical insurance reimbursement standards and strengthening regulation of medical and pricing practices as discussed below.
Centralized procurement and tenders
Under current regulations, public medical institutions owned by the government or owned by state-owned or controlled enterprises are required to purchase pharmaceutical products through centralized online procurement processes. There are exceptions for drugs on the National List of Essential Drugs, which must comply with their own procurement rules, and for certain drugs subject to the central government’s special control such as toxic, radioactive and narcotic drugs, and traditional Chinese medicines.
The centralized procurement process takes the form of public tenders operated by provincial or municipal-level government agencies. The centralized tender process is typically conducted once every year. The bids are assessed by a committee randomly selected from a database of experts. The committee members assess the bids based on a number of factors, including but not limited to bid price, product quality, clinical effectiveness, product safety, level of technology, qualifications and reputation of the manufacturer, after-sale services and innovation.
Over the last decade, the government has been using various methods to ensure that drugs are offered at affordable prices. In 2009, the central government announced a campaign to implement a “zero markup” policy on essential drugs among basic healthcare institutions, which has been fully implemented nationwide. In addition, some local government have begun to allow medical institutions to collectively negotiate with manufacturers for a second price to further lower the already agreed bid price. The newly adopted Two-Invoice System is also aimed to reduce price mark-ups brought about by multi-tier distribution chains.
Other PRC national- and provincial-level laws and regulations
We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties. The privacy of human subjects in clinical trials is also protected under regulations. For example, the case report forms must avoid disclosing names of the human subjects.
These laws and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future, including restrictions on transfer of healthcare data. The Cybersecurity Law that took effect in 2017 designates healthcare as a priority area that is part of critical information infrastructure, and China’s cyberspace administration is working to finalize a draft rule on cross-border transfer of personal information.
PRC Regulation of Foreign Investment
Investment activities in China by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. Pursuant to the latest Catalogue which came into effect in July 2017 with the latest amendment being effective as of July 2018, or the 2017 Catalogue, industries are divided into two categories: encouraged industries and the industries within the catalogue of special management measures, or the Negative List. The Negative List is further divided into two sub-categories: restricted industries and prohibited industries. Establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in industries outside of the Negative List. For the restricted industries within the Negative List, some are limited to equity or contractual joint ventures, while in some cases Chinese partners are required to hold the majority interests in such joint ventures. In addition, restricted category projects are subject to government approvals and certain special 
39

requirements. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Pursuant to the 2017 Catalogue, the manufacture of innovative oncology drugs and certain other kinds of pharmaceutical products falls in the encouraged industries for foreign investment.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange
The Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations are the principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, may be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, by complying with certain procedural requirements. In contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities or designated banks is required when RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
Under current regulations, the capital of a foreign-invested enterprise and capital in RMB obtained by the foreign-invested enterprise from foreign exchange settlement must not be used for the following purposes: directly or indirectly used for the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by relevant laws and regulations; directly or indirectly used for investment in securities, unless otherwise provided by relevant laws and regulations; extending loans to non-related parties, unless permitted by the scope of business; and/or paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate that is not for self-use, except for the real estate enterprises.
In 2017, new regulations were adopted which, among other things, relax the policy restriction on foreign exchange inflow to further enhance trade and investment facilitation and tighten genuineness and compliance verification of cross-border transactions and cross-border capital flows.
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distributions
The principal laws, rules and regulations governing dividend distributions by foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC are the PRC Company Law, as amended, the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law and its implementating regulations, and the Sino-foreign Joint Venture Law and its implementing regulations. Under these requirements, foreign-invested enterprises may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profit, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Both PRC domestic companies and wholly-foreign owned PRC enterprises are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain capital reserve funds until the aggregate amount of these reserve funds have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year.
Labor Laws and Social Insurance
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law and the PRC Labor Contract Law, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees. All employers must comply with local minimum wage standards. Employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety to provide employees with occupational training to prevent occupational injury, and employers are required to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions. Violations of the PRC Labor Contract Law and the PRC Labor Law may result in the imposition of fines and other administrative and criminal liability in the case of serious violations.
In addition, according to the PRC Social Insurance Law, employers like our PRC subsidiaries in China must provide employees with welfare schemes covering pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing funds.
Rest of World Regulation
For other countries outside of the United States and the PRC, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
