Item 1.  Business
Business Overview
The principal business of CIM Commercial Trust Corporation and its subsidiaries (which may be referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we," "us," "our," "our company", "CIM Commercial" or the "Company") is to acquire, own, and operate Class A and creative office assets in vibrant and improving metropolitan communities throughout the United States. These communities are located in areas that include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. 
We are operated by affiliates of CIM Group, L.P. ("CIM Group" or "CIM"). CIM Group is a vertically-integrated owner and operator of real assets with multi-disciplinary expertise and in-house research, acquisition, credit analysis, development, financing, leasing, and onsite property management capabilities. CIM Group is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and has offices in Oakland, California; Bethesda, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Phoenix, Arizona. See the captions "Overview and History of CIM Group", "CIM Urban Partnership Agreement" and "Investment Management Agreement" in "Item 1—Business" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We seek to utilize the CIM Group platform to acquire, improve and develop real estate assets within CIM Group’s qualified communities (“Qualified Communities”). We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment, and significant private investment that characterize these areas. Over time, we seek to expand our real estate assets in communities targeted by CIM Group, supported by CIM Group’s broad real estate capabilities, as part of our plan to prudently grow market value and earnings.
We primarily acquire Class A and creative office assets located in areas that CIM Group has targeted. These areas include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. CIM Group believes that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. CIM Group targets acquisitions of diverse types of real estate assets, including office, retail, for-rent and for-sale multifamily residential, hotel, parking, and signage through CIM Group’s extensive network and its current opportunistic activities. 
Our reportable segments consist of two types of commercial real estate properties, namely office and hotel, as well as a segment for our lending business, which primarily originates loans to small businesses. As of December 31, 2018, our real estate portfolio consisted of 21 assets, all of which are fee-simple properties. As of December 31, 2018, our 19 office properties (including one parking garage and two development sites, one of which is being used as a parking lot), totaling approximately 3.4 million rentable square feet, were 93.2% occupied and one hotel with an ancillary parking garage, which has a total of 503 rooms, had revenue per available room ("RevPAR") of $129.73 for the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our office portfolio contributed approximately 74.9% of revenue from continuing operations, while our hotel contributed approximately 19.6%, and our lending segment contributed approximately 5.5%.

Our office and hotel assets are located in six U.S. markets. The breakdown by segment, market and submarket, as of December 31, 2018, is as follows:

Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock
Asset Sale. In December 2018, the Company obtained the approval of our principal stockholder, which as of the relevant record date owned 95.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), for the sale of properties specified in the Information Statement on Schedule 14C, filed by the Company with the SEC on January 9, 2019, so long as the aggregate net proceeds from the sale(s) (excluding any property-level cash or restricted cash but after giving effect to any adjustments to the sale price of each property as any authorized officer of the Company determines customary or appropriate in these circumstances, including the settlement of any related property-level assets and liabilities, repayment, assumption, or defeasance of any related mortgage and the costs associated with such repayment, assumption or defeasance, and the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the sale(s)) are not less than 90% of the aggregate net asset value of the properties (determined as of September 30, 2018 on a fair value basis) that are sold (such sales, collectively, the “Asset Sale”). 
The aggregate net proceeds from the sales of six properties sold to date as part of the Asset Sale exceeds 90% of the aggregate net asset value of such properties (determined as of September 30, 2018 on a fair value basis). The Company has been marketing additional properties for sale as part of the Asset Sale, though the Company has not entered into a definitive agreement with respect to such properties and there can be no assurance that such properties will be sold or that the Company will continue to market such properties for sale as part of the Asset Sale.
The Asset Sale represents the first part of a broader plan of the Company with the purpose of, among other things, unlocking embedded value in its portfolio, enhancing growth prospects and improving the trading liquidity of its Common Stock (the "Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock"). Other than the Asset Sale, the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock is expected to involve the Debt Repayment (as defined below), the Return of Capital Event (as defined below) and the CIM REIT Liquidation (as defined below). Other than the Asset Sale, there can be no guarantee that any of the transactions involved in the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock will occur or, if any or all of them occur, that they will occur in the form currently contemplated.

Repayment of Certain Indebtedness. We have used and may use a portion of our unrestricted cash and net proceeds from the Asset Sale to repay balances on certain of the Company’s indebtedness (the “Debt Repayment”).

Return of Capital to Holders of Common Stock.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Asset Sale (other than to the extent used for the Debt Repayment) and a portion of our unrestricted cash balances and or funds from our revolving credit facility, to return capital to holders of our Common Stock for consideration approximating our net asset value (“NAV”) per share of Common Stock, after certain adjustments, in one or more transactions, which may take the form of a special dividend, private repurchase or tender offer (collectively, the “Return of Capital Event”).

CIM REIT Liquidation.  As of March 15, 2019, CIM Urban REIT, LLC, a fund operated by affiliates of CIM Group (“CIM REIT”), beneficially owned 89.7% of our outstanding Common Stock.  We have been informed that, if the Return of Capital Event occurs, CIM Group intends to liquidate CIM REIT by distributing to its members, consisting of 26 institutional investors, all shares of our Common Stock then held by CIM REIT (the “CIM REIT Liquidation”).  We expect that such 
4

distribution, if it occurs, will increase our public float significantly (from approximately 9% as of March 15, 2019), which is expected to improve trading volume over time and make our Common Stock eligible for inclusion in several indices.
Preferred Stock. The Company believes that there will be more clarity to the makeup of the Company’s portfolio, the aggregate sale price in any asset sales and the trading price of the Company’s common stock relative to its NAV following the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock, if it is consummated. The Company has met and consulted with certain holders of the Preferred Stock (as defined in "Item 1A. Risk Factors") as it considers such engagement to be important and expects to continue to provide updates at significant milestones during the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock. Following the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock, the Company intends to finalize any alternatives for its preferred stockholders with terms that the Company believes such holders will then find satisfactory.
Business Objectives and Growth Strategies
Our strategy is principally focused on the acquisition of Class A and creative office assets in vibrant and improving metropolitan communities throughout the United States (including improving and developing such assets) in a manner that will consistently grow our NAV and cash flow per share of Common Stock. We primarily acquire Class A and creative office assets located in areas that CIM Group has targeted. These areas include traditional downtown areas and suburban main streets, which have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and a propensity for growth. CIM Group believes that the critical mass of redevelopment in such areas creates positive externalities, which enhance the value of real estate assets in the area. CIM Group targets acquisitions of diverse types of real estate assets, including office, retail, for-rent and for-sale multifamily residential, hotel, parking, and signage through CIM Group’s extensive network and its current opportunistic activities.
We seek to utilize the CIM Group platform to acquire, improve and develop real estate assets within CIM Group’s qualified communities (“Qualified Communities”). We believe assets in these markets provide greater returns as a result of population growth, support for investment, and significant private investment within these areas. Over time, we seek to expand our real estate assets in communities targeted by CIM Group, supported by CIM Group’s broad real estate capabilities, as part of our plan to prudently grow market value and earnings.
CIM Group seeks to maximize the value of its holdings through active onsite property management and leasing. CIM Group has extensive in-house research, acquisition, credit analysis, development, financing, leasing and onsite property management capabilities, which leverage its deep understanding of metropolitan communities to position properties for multiple uses and to maximize operating income. As a vertically-integrated owner and operator, CIM Group has in-house onsite property management and leasing capabilities. Property managers prepare annual capital and operating budgets and monthly operating reports, monitor results and oversee vendor services, maintenance and capital improvement schedules. In addition, they ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. CIM Group's real assets management committee (the "Real Assets Management Committee") reviews and approves strategic plans for each asset, including financial, leasing, marketing, property positioning and disposition plans. In addition, the Real Assets Management Committee reviews and approves the annual business plan for each property, including its capital and operating budget. CIM Group's organizational structure provides for continuity through multi-disciplinary teams responsible for an asset from the time of the original investment recommendation, through the implementation of the asset's business plan, and any disposition activities.

CIM Group's investments and development teams are separate groups that work very closely together on transactions requiring development expertise. While the investments team is responsible for acquisition analysis, both the investments and development teams perform the due diligence, evaluate and determine underwriting assumptions and participate in the development management and ongoing asset management of CIM Group’s opportunistic assets. The development team is also responsible for the oversight and or execution of securing entitlements and the development/repositioning process. In instances where CIM Group is not the lead developer, CIM Group's in-house development team continues to provide development and construction oversight to co-sponsors through a shadow team that oversees the progress of the development from beginning to end to ensure adherence to the budgets, schedules, quality and scope of the project to maintain CIM Group’s vision for the final product. The investments and development teams interact as a cohesive team when sourcing, underwriting, acquiring, executing and managing the business plan of an opportunistic acquisition.

Competitive Advantages
We believe that CIM Group’s experienced team and vertically-integrated and multi-disciplinary organization, coupled with its community-focused and disciplined real estate philosophy, results in a competitive advantage that benefits us. Additionally, CIM Group’s strategy is complemented by a number of other competitive advantages including its prudent use of leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, and strong network of relationships. CIM Group’s competitive advantages include: 
·                  Vertically-Integrated Organization and Team

CIM Group is managed by its senior management team, which is composed of its three founders, Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avi Shemesh, and includes 11 other principals. CIM Group is vertically-integrated and organized into 13 functional groups including Compliance; Operations; Human Resources; Legal; Finance & Capital Markets; Onsite Property Management; Real Estate Services; Hospitality Services; Development; Investments; Portfolio Oversight; Partner & Co-Investor Relations; and Marketing & Communications.

To support CIM Group’s organic growth and related platforms, CIM Group has invested substantial time and resources in building a strong and integrated team of approximately 540 experienced professionals. Each of CIM Group’s teams is managed by seasoned professionals and CIM Group continues to develop its management team, which represents the next generation of CIM Group’s leaders. In addition to developing a core team of principals and senior level management, CIM Group has proactively managed its growth through career development and mentoring at both the mid and junior staffing levels, and has hired ahead of its needs, thus ensuring appropriate management and staffing.

CIM Group leverages the deep operating and industry experience of its principals and professionals, as well as their extensive relationships, to source and execute opportunistic, stabilized, and infrastructure acquisitions. Each opportunity is overseen by a dedicated team including an oversight principal (one of Richard Ressler, Avi Shemesh, Shaul Kuba, Charles E. Garner II, our Chief Executive Officer, Jennifer Gandin, John Bruno and Jason Schreiber), a team lead (vice president level and above), associate vice presidents and associates, as necessary, who are responsible for managing the asset from sourcing through underwriting, acquisition, development (if required), onsite property management, and disposition. As part of this process, the team draws upon CIM Group’s extensive in-house expertise in legal matters, finance, development, leasing, and onsite property management. Each dedicated investment team is purposefully staffed with professionals from multiple CIM Group offices, regardless of the location of the asset being evaluated. As a result, all investment professionals work across a variety of Qualified Communities and CIM Group’s knowledge base is shared across all of its offices.

·                  Community Qualification

Since inception, CIM Group’s proven community qualification process has served as the foundation for its strategy. CIM Group targets high barrier to entry markets and submarkets with high population density and applies rigorous research to qualify for potential acquisitions. Since 1994, CIM Group has qualified 122 communities in high barrier to entry markets and has deployed capital in 72 of these Qualified Communities. CIM Group examines the characteristics of a market to determine whether the district justifies the extensive efforts its investment professionals undertake in reviewing and making potential acquisitions in its Qualified Communities. Qualified Communities generally fall into one of two categories: (i) transitional densely-populated districts that have dedicated resources to become vibrant metropolitan communities and (ii) well-established, thriving metropolitan areas (typically major central business districts).

Once a community is qualified, CIM Group believes it continues to differentiate itself through the following business principles: (i) product non-specific— CIM Group has extensive experience owning and operating a diverse range of property types, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage, and mixed-use, which gives CIM Group the ability to execute and capitalize on its strategy effectively; (ii) community-based tenanting— CIM Group’s strategy focuses on the entire community and the best use of assets in that community; owning a significant number of key properties in an area better enables CIM Group to meet the needs of national retailers and office tenants and thus optimize the value of these real estate properties; (iii) local market leadership with North American footprint— CIM Group maintains local market knowledge and relationships, along with a diversified North American presence, through its 122 Qualified Communities (thus, CIM Group has the flexibility to deploy capital in its Qualified Communities only when the market environment meets CIM Group’s underwriting standards); and (iv) deploying capital across the capital stack— CIM Group has extensive experience structuring transactions across the capital 
6

stack including equity, preferred equity, debt and mezzanine positions, giving it the flexibility to structure transactions in efficient and creative ways.

·                  Discipline

CIM Group’s strategy relies on its sound business plan and value creation execution to produce returns, rather than financial engineering. CIM Group’s underwriting of its potential acquisitions is performed generally both on a leveraged and unleveraged basis. Additionally, with certain exceptions, CIM Group has generally not utilized recourse or cross-collateralized debt due to its conservative underwriting standards.
CIM Group employs multiple underwriting scenarios when evaluating potential acquisition opportunities. CIM Group generally underwrites potential acquisitions utilizing long-term average exit capitalization rates for similar product types and long-term average interest rates. Where possible, these long-term averages cross multiple market cycles, thereby mitigating the risk of cyclical volatility. CIM Group’s “long-term average” underwriting is based on its belief, reinforced by its experience through multiple market cycles, that over the life of any given fund that it manages, such fund should be able to exit its holdings at long-term historical averages. CIM Group also underwrites a “current market case” scenario, which generally utilizes current submarket specific exit assumptions and interest rates, in order to reflect anticipated results under current market conditions. CIM Group believes that utilizing multiple underwriting scenarios enables CIM Group to assess potential returns relative to risk within a range of potential outcomes.
Strategy
Our strategy is principally focused on the acquisition of Class A and creative office assets in vibrant and improving, metropolitan communities throughout the United States (including improving and developing such assets) in a manner that will consistently grow our NAV and cash flow per share of Common Stock. 
Our strategy is centered around CIM Group's community qualification process. We believe this strategy provides us with a significant competitive advantage when making real estate acquisitions. The qualification process generally takes between six months and five years and is a critical component of CIM Group's evaluation. CIM Group examines the characteristics of a market to determine whether the district justifies the extensive efforts CIM Group undertakes in reviewing and making potential acquisitions in its Qualified Communities. Qualified Communities generally fall into one of two categories: (i) transitional densely-populated districts that have dedicated resources to become vibrant metropolitan communities and (ii) well-established, thriving metropolitan areas (typically major central business districts). Qualified Communities are distinct districts which have dedicated resources to become or are currently vibrant communities where people can live, work, shop and be entertained, all within walking distance or close proximity to public transportation. These areas also generally have high barriers to entry, high population density, positive population trends and support for investment. CIM Group believes that a vast majority of the risks associated with acquiring real estate are mitigated by accumulating local market knowledge of the community where the asset is located. CIM Group typically spends significant time and resources qualifying targeted communities prior to making any acquisitions. Since 1994, CIM Group has qualified 122 communities and has deployed capital in 72 of these Qualified Communities. Although we may not deploy capital exclusively in Qualified Communities, it is expected that most of our assets will be identified through this systematic process. 
We seek to utilize the CIM Group platform to acquire, improve and develop real estate assets within CIM Group's Qualified Communities. We believe that these assets will provide greater returns than similar assets in other markets, as a result of the population growth, public commitment, and significant private investment that characterize these areas. Over time, we seek to expand our real estate assets in communities targeted by CIM Group, supported by CIM Group's broad real estate capabilities, as part of our plan to prudently grow market value and earnings. As a matter of prudent management, we also regularly evaluate each asset within our portfolio as well as our strategies. Such review may result in dispositions when an asset no longer fits our overall objectives or strategies or when our view of the market value of such asset is equal to or exceeds its intrinsic value. As a result of such review, we sold two hotels in 2016; six office properties, one parking garage, and five multifamily properties in 2017; and, in connection with the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock, three office properties and one parking garage in Oakland, California, one office property in Washington, D.C., and one office property in San Francisco, California in March 2019. Such review may result in additional dispositions from time to time. In 2016 and 2017, we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds of such dispositions to provide liquidity to our common stockholders at prices reflecting our NAV and cash flow prospects, and we expect to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds from the Asset Sale to do so in 2019. 
7

While we are principally focused on Class A and creative office assets in vibrant and improving metropolitan communities throughout the United States (including improving and developing such assets), we may also participate more actively in other CIM Group real estate strategies and product types in order to broaden our participation in CIM Group’s platform and capabilities for the benefit of all classes of stockholders. This may include, without limitation, engaging in real estate development activities as well as investing in other product types directly, side-by-side with one or more funds of CIM Group, through direct deployment of capital in a CIM Group real estate or debt fund, or deploying capital in or originating loans that are secured directly or indirectly by properties primarily located in Qualified Communities that meet our strategy. Such loans may include limited and or non-recourse junior (mezzanine, B-note or 2nd lien) and senior acquisition, bridge or repositioning loans.
2018 Acquisitions
On January 18, 2018, we acquired a 100% fee-simple interest in an office property known as 9460 Wilshire Boulevard from an unrelated third-party. The property has approximately 68,866 square feet of office space and 22,884 square feet of retail space and is located in Beverly Hills, California. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from our offering of series L preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Series L Preferred Stock"), and the acquired property is reported as part of the office segment.

 | Asset | Date of | | Purchase 
Property | Type | Acquisition | Square Feet | Price (1) 
 | | | | (in thousands)
9460 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, CA | Office | January 18, 2018 | 91,750 | $ | 132,000


(1) | Transaction costs that were capitalized in connection with the acquisition of this property totaled $48,000, which are not included in the purchase price above.

2018 Dispositions
There were no dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2018.
2019 Dispositions

In March 2019, we sold 100% fee-simple interests in three office properties and one parking garage in Oakland, California, one office property in Washington, D.C., and one office property in San Francisco, California in each case to unrelated third-parties. The aggregate gain on the sale of these properties is expected to be approximately $353,000,000.
Financing Strategy
We currently have substantial unrestricted cash and borrowing capacity, and may finance our future activities through one or more of the following methods: (i) offerings of shares of Common Stock, preferred stock, senior unsecured securities, and or other equity and debt securities; (ii) credit facilities and term loans; (iii) the addition of senior recourse or non-recourse debt using target acquisitions as well as existing assets as collateral; (iv) the sale of existing assets; and or (v) cash flows from operations. During the prior three years, we have not offered our Common Stock or other securities in exchange for property, but may engage in such activities in the future. We expect to employ indebtedness levels that are comparable to those of other commercial real estate investment trusts ("REITs") engaged in business strategies similar to our own. 
We have used and may use a portion of our unrestricted cash, which at December 31, 2018 was $54,931,000, and net proceeds from the Asset Sale to repay balances on certain of the Company’s indebtedness. Upon completion of the Program to Unlock Embedded Value in Our Portfolio and Improve Trading Liquidity of Our Common Stock, we expect to continue to have substantial unrestricted cash and or borrowing capacity.
Risk Management
As part of its risk management strategy, CIM Group continually evaluates our assets and actively manages the risks involved in our business strategies. CIM Group's Investments and Portfolio Oversight teams share asset management responsibilities, setting the strategy for and monitoring the performance of our assets relative to market and industry benchmarks and internal underwriting assumptions using direct knowledge of local markets provided by CIM Group's in-house 
8

onsite property management, and leasing professionals. In-house onsite property management capabilities include monthly and annual budgeting and reporting as well as vendor services management, property maintenance and capital expenditures management. Property management seeks to ensure that revenue objectives are met, lease terms are followed, receivables are collected, preventative maintenance programs are implemented, vendors are evaluated and expenses are controlled. The Real Assets Management Committee oversees onsite property management and consists of certain of the Oversight Principals, each of whom has extensive experience in acquisitions, development, onsite property management and leasing, who are ultimately responsible for the performance of the asset, and the chief compliance officer. The Oversight Principals work with each CIM Group team to ensure that every asset benefits from the full range of CIM Group's real estate expertise. CIM Group believes that empowering its most seasoned investment professionals to bring their breadth of experience to bear directly on assets will optimize returns. 
The Oversight Principals meet informally on a frequent basis, generally weekly, to review and discuss the performance of assets, and meet formally at least annually to review and approve strategic plans for our assets based on their review of: financial and operational analyses, operating strategies and agreements, tenant composition and marketing, asset positioning, market conditions affecting our assets, hold/sell analyses and timing considerations, and the annual business plan for each asset, including its capital and operating budget.
The size, composition, and policies of the Real Assets Management Committee may change from time to time.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental Matters
Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, the release of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under some of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for costs related to soil or groundwater contamination on or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site.
These laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property, to borrow using the property as collateral or create lender's liability for us. In addition, third parties exposed to hazardous or toxic substances may sue for personal injury damages and or property damages.  For example, some laws impose liability for release of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials. As a result, in connection with our former, current or future ownership, operation, and development of real properties, or our role as a lender for loans secured directly or indirectly by real estate properties, we may be potentially liable for investigation and cleanup costs, penalties and damages under environmental laws.  
Although many of our properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, known as Phase I assessments, by independent environmental consultants that identify certain liabilities, Phase I assessments are limited in scope, and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with a property. Unless required by applicable law, we may decide not to further investigate, remedy or ameliorate the liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments.  
Further, these or other environmental studies may not identify all potential environmental liabilities or accurately assess whether we will incur material environmental liabilities in the future. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations or to maintain our level of distributions on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock (as defined in "Item 1A. Risk Factors") could be materially adversely affected.
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA"), all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that our properties substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance. If one or more of our properties or future properties are not in compliance with the ADA, we might be required to take remedial action which would require us to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. We cannot predict the ultimate amount, if any, of the cost of compliance with the ADA.

Competition
We compete with others engaged in the acquisition, origination, development, and operation of real estate and real estate-related assets. Our competitors include REITs, insurance companies, pension funds, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, mortgage banks, investment banks, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, specialty finance companies, and private and institutional investors and financial companies that pursue strategies similar to ours. Some of our competitors may be larger than us with greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or lower profitability targets than us, which could allow them to pursue new business more aggressively than us. We believe that our relationship with CIM Group gives us a competitive advantage that allows us to operate more effectively in the markets in which we conduct our business.

CIM Group was founded in 1994 by Shaul Kuba, Richard Ressler and Avi Shemesh and has owned and operated approximately $30.6 billion of assets across its vehicles as of December 31, 2018.1 CIM Group's successful track record is anchored by CIM Group's community-oriented approach to acquisitions as well as a number of other competitive advantages including its prudent use of leverage, underwriting approach, disciplined capital deployment, vertically-integrated capabilities and strong network of relationships.
CIM Group is headquartered in Los Angeles, California and has offices in Oakland, California; Bethesda, Maryland; Dallas, Texas; New York, New York; Chicago, Illinois; and Phoenix, Arizona. CIM Group has generated strong risk-adjusted returns across multiple market cycles by focusing on improved asset and community performance, and capitalizing on market inefficiencies and distressed situations.
Principles
As described in "Item 1—Business—Competitive Advantages" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the community qualification process is one of CIM Group's core competencies, which demonstrates a disciplined investing program and strategic outlook on metropolitan communities. Once a community is qualified, CIM Group believes it continues to differentiate itself through the following business principles:
1 "Assets Owned and Operated ("AOO")" represents the aggregate assets owned and operated by CIM Group on behalf of partners (including where CIM Group contributes alongside for its own account) and co-investors, whether or not CIM Group has discretion, in each case without duplication. AOO includes total gross assets at fair value, with real assets presented on the basis described in "Book Value" below and operating companies presented at gross assets less debt, as of the Report Date (as defined below) (including the shares of such assets owned by joint venture partners and co-investments), plus binding unfunded commitments. AOO also includes the $0.3 billion of AOO attributable to CIM Compass Latin America ("CCLA"), which is 50% owned and jointly operated by CIM Group. AOO for CMMT Partners, L.P. ("CMMT") (which represents assets under management), a perpetual-life real estate debt fund, is $0.7 billion as of the Report Date. "Report Date" is defined to mean as of December 31, 2018. "Book Value," for each investment generally represents the investment’s book value as reflected in the applicable fund’s unaudited financial statements as of the Report Date prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles on a fair value basis. These book values generally represent the asset’s third-party appraised value as of the Report Date, but in the case of CIM Group’s Cole Net-Lease Asset strategy, book values generally represent undepreciated cost (as reflected in SEC-filed financial statements). "Equity Owned and Operated" ("EOO"), representing the NAV (as defined below) before incentive fee allocation, plus binding unfunded commitments, is $17.8 billion as of the Report Date, inclusive of $0.3 billion of EOO attributable to CCLA (as described above) and $0.7 billion of EOO for CMMT (which represents equity under management). For calculating the Book Value for CIM REIT, the underlying assets of CMCT are assumed to be liquidated based upon the third-party appraised value. CIM does not view the price of CMCT’s publicly-traded shares to be a meaningful indication of the fair value of CIM REIT’s interest in CMCT due to the fact that the publicly-traded shares of CMCT represent less than 10% of the outstanding shares of CMCT and are thinly-traded. "Net Asset Value" ("NAV") represents the distributable amount based on a "hypothetical liquidation" assuming that on the date of determination that: (i) investments are sold at their Book Values; (ii) debts are paid and other assets are collected; and (iii) appropriate adjustments and/or allocations between equity partners are made in accordance with applicable documents, as determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

• | Product Non-Specific: CIM Group has extensive experience owning and operating a diverse range of property types, including retail, residential, office, parking, hotel, signage, and mixed-use, which gives CIM Group the ability to execute and capitalize on its strategy effectively. Successful acquisitions require selecting the right markets coupled with providing the right product. CIM Group's experience with multiple asset types does not predispose CIM Group to select certain asset types, but instead ensures that they deliver a product mix that is consistent with the market's requirements and needs. Additionally, there is a growing trend towards developing mixed-use real estate properties in metropolitan markets which requires a diversified platform to successfully execute. 


• | Community-Based Tenanting: CIM Group's strategy focuses on the entire community and the best use of assets in that community. Owning a significant number of key properties in an area better enables CIM Group to meet the needs of national retailers and office tenants and thus optimize the value of these real estate properties. CIM Group believes that its community perspective gives it a significant competitive advantage in attracting tenants to its retail, office and mixed-use properties and creating synergies between the different tenant types. 


• | Local Market Leadership with North American Footprint: CIM Group maintains local market knowledge and relationships, along with a diversified North American presence, through its 122 Qualified Communities. Thus, CIM Group has the flexibility to deploy capital in its Qualified Communities only when the market environment meets CIM Group's underwriting standards. CIM Group does not need to acquire assets in a given community or product type at a specific time due to its broad proprietary pipeline of communities. 


• | Deploying Capital Across the Capital Stack: CIM Group has extensive experience structuring transactions across the capital stack including equity, preferred equity, debt and mezzanine positions, giving it the flexibility to structure transactions in efficient and creative ways.

The Operator is responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses relating to the general operation of its business, including administrative expenses, employment expenses and office expenses.

In addition, CIM Urban agreed to indemnify the Operator against losses, claims, damages or liabilities, and reimburse the Operator for its legal and other expenses, in each case incurred in connection with any action, proceeding or investigation arising out of or in connection with CIM Urban's business or affairs, except to the extent such losses or expenses result from fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or a breach of the terms of the Investment Management Agreement by the Operator.
Nothing in the Investment Management Agreement limits or restricts the right of any partner, officer or employee of the Operator to engage in any other business or to devote his time and attention in part to any other business. Nothing in the Investment Management Agreement limits or restricts the right of the Operator to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other person.
