The Company’s products are used as components and assemblies in a broad range of military, space and industrial systems, including aircraft instrumentation and navigation systems, satellite systems, power supplies, electronic controls, computers, medical devices, and high-temperature (200o C) products.
 
The Company’s facilities are certified and qualified by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to MIL-PRF-38534 (class K-space level) and MIL-PRF-19500 JANS (space level) and are certified to ISO 9001:2008 and AS 9100C. Micropac is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) core supplier, and is registered to AS9100-Aerospace Industry standard for supplier certification. The Company has Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approval on our industrial power controllers.
 
The Company’s core technology is microelectronic and optoelectronic designs to include the packaging and interconnecting of multi-chip microelectronics modules. Other technologies include light emitting and light sensitive materials and products, including light emitting diodes and silicon phototransistors, and electronic integration used in the Company’s optoelectronic components and assemblies.
 
The business of the Company was started in 1963 as a sole proprietorship. On March 3, 1969, the Company was incorporated under the name of “Micropac Industries, Inc.” in the state of Delaware. The stock was publicly held by 445 shareholders on November 30, 2018.
 
PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES
 
The Company’s products are either custom (being application-specific circuits designed and manufactured to meet the particular requirements of a single customer) or standard proprietary components. Custom-designed components and assemblies accounted for approximately 44% of the Company’s sales for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, and were 41% for fiscal 2017. Standard components and assemblies accounted for approximately 56% of the Company’s sales for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018, and were 59% for fiscal 2017.
 
The Company provides power management and controls, sensors and displays, and optocouplers products, to include components and assemblies that offers a wide range of products sold to the industrial, medical, military, aerospace and space markets.
 
The power management and controls technologies, including custom microcircuits, solid state relays, power operational amplifiers, and regulators accounted for 26% of the Company’s business in 2018 compared to 41% in 2017. Sensors and displays accounted for 48% of the Company’s business and the optocouplers product accounted for 26% of the Company’s business in 2018, compared to 33% and 26% in 2017, respectively.

The Company has two patents. The Company has no licenses, franchises or labor contracts. The Company’s trademark “Mii” is registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
 
Sales of our products internationally are subject to government regulations, including export control regulations of the U.S. Department of State and Department of Commerce. Violation of these regulations by the Company could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges. The Company is not aware of any violations of export control regulations or similar applicable government regulations.
 
Five of the Company’s principal product families require government approval. Further, a significant portion of our business is military and is dependent on maintaining our facility certifications to MIL-PRF-38534 and MIL-PRF-19500. In addition, several customers require the Company maintain AS 9100 certifications. We expect to maintain these certifications and qualifications; however, the loss of any of these certifications would have a significant negative impact on our business.
 
Government regulations impose certain controls on chemicals used in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing. Micropac has obtained all the necessary environmental permits, and routinely monitors and reports the wastewater stream results to the local governing agency. Micropac is classified as a small generator of hazardous waste, and the annual cost of complying with the regulations is minimal.
 
In 2018, the Company’s investment in technology through research and development, which was expensed, totaled approximately $1,271,000 ($1,704,000 in 2017). The Company’s research and development expenditures were directed primarily toward standard proprietary power management products, including industrial power controllers and DC-DC converters, fiber optic transceivers, high voltage optocouplers and continued product development and improvement associated with the Company’s space level and other high reliability products.
 
In addition to the Company’s investment in research and development, various customers paid the Company approximately $2,001,000 in non-recurring engineering revenue with $1,530,000 recorded within cost of goods sold associated with the development of custom products for specific applications.
 
The Company provides a one year warranty from the date of shipment to the original purchaser. The Company is obligated under this warranty to either replace or repair defective goods or refund the purchase price paid by the buyer.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
The Company’s products are marketed throughout the United States and in Western Europe, through a direct technical sales staff, independent representatives and independent stocking distributors. Approximately 10% of the sales for fiscal year 2018 (20% in 2017) were to international customers. Sales to Western European customers are made by independent representatives under the coordination of the Company’s office in Bremen, Germany.
 
Sales through the Company’s distribution channels were $5,396,000 in 2018 compared to $5,433,000 in 2017, or 26% and 28% of sales, respectively.

COMPETITION
 
The Company competes with two or more companies with respect to each of its major products. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater capital resources than the Company. Management believes the Company’s competitive position is favorable with regard to our product reliability and integrity, past performance, customer service and responsiveness, timely delivery and pricing; however, no assurance can be given that the Company can compete successfully in the future.
 
There are approximately 47 independent manufacturing companies who are certified to supply microcircuits to MIL-PRF-38534 or supply semiconductors to MIL-PRF-19500, in addition to OEM’s, who manufacture hybrid microcircuits for their internal needs. Micropac may compete with all of these for hybrid microcircuit, power management and optoelectronics business. Some of the Company’s primary competitors are Anaren, Avago, Cobham, and International Rectifier.
 
SUPPLY CHAIN
 
The parts and raw materials for the Company’s products are generally available from more than one source. Except for certain optoelectronic products, the Company does not manufacture the basic parts or materials used in production of its products. From time to time, the Company has experienced difficulty in obtaining certain materials when needed. The Company’s inability to secure materials for any reason could have adverse effects on the Company’s ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could result in loss of customers or sales. However, the Company has not been materially affected by such shortages. The Company uses capacitors, active semiconductor devices (primarily in chip form), hermetic packages, ceramic substrates, resistor inks, conductor pastes, precious metals and other materials in its manufacturing operations. The Company’s delivery commitments to customers allow for adequate lead times for production of the products including lead time for order and receipt from the supply chain.
 
Some of the Company’s primary suppliers are NTK Technologies, Cirexx International, Schott, Semi-Dice, Micross Components, and Materion Advanced Materials.
