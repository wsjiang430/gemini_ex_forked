Recent Developments
European Vacation Rentals Business
We sold our European vacation rentals business on May 9, 2018. This sale resulted in final net proceeds of $1.06 billion and an after-tax gain of $456 million, net of $139 million in taxes. We have provided post-closing credit support in order to ensure that Platinum Equity, LLC (the “Buyer”) meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities. The results of operations of this business have been classified as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further details see Note 6—Discontinued Operations to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Hotel Business Spin-off
We completed the spin-off of our hotel business on May 31, 2018, which resulted in our operations being held by two separate, publicly traded companies. The two public companies have entered into long-term exclusive license agreements to retain their

affiliations with one of the industry’s top-rated loyalty programs, Wyndham Rewards, as well as to continue to collaborate on inventory-sharing and customer cross-selling initiatives. This transaction is expected to result in enhanced strategic and management focus on the core business and growth of each company; more efficient capital allocation, direct access to capital and expanded growth opportunities for each company; the ability to implement a tailored approach to recruiting and retaining employees at each company; improved investor understanding of the business strategy and operating results of each company; and enhanced investor choice by offering investment opportunities in separate entities. This transaction was effected through a pro rata distribution of the new hotel entity’s stock to existing Wyndham Destinations shareholders. The new hotel company was named Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham Hotels”). As a result of the Spin-off, we have classified the results of operations of our hotel business as discontinued operations on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For further details see Note 6—Discontinued Operations to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
North American Vacation Rentals Business
During 2018, the Company decided to explore strategic alternatives for its North American vacation rentals business and during the fourth quarter commenced activities to facilitate the sale of this business. The assets and liabilities of this business have been classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018. This business does not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation; therefore, the results were reflected within continuing operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For further details see Note 7—Held-for-Sale Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Continuing Operations
Following the sale of the European vacation rentals business and the spin-off of the hotel business, our continuing operations are grouped into two segments: Vacation Ownership and Exchange & Rentals. 

• | Vacation Ownership is the world’s largest timeshare business, with 224 resorts and approximately 880,000 owners. We develop and market Vacation Ownership Interests (“VOIs”) to individual consumers, provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of VOIs and provide property management services at resorts.


• | Exchange & Rentals operates the world’s largest vacation exchange network, with approximately 3.8 million members, and is a leading provider of professionally managed vacation rentals in North America. Our vacation exchange business has relationships with over 4,300 vacation ownership resorts located in approximately 110 countries and territories, and our vacation rentals business offers North American-based rental properties in over 50 destinations. This is primarily a Fee-for-Service business that provides stable revenue streams and produces strong cash flow.

Our business segments generate a diversified revenue stream and significant cash flow. Approximately 41% of our revenues are generated from our fee-for-service businesses. We derive our fee revenues principally from (i) the sale of VOIs and related financing, (ii) providing property management services to Vacation Ownership resorts, (iii) providing vacation exchange and rentals services and (iv) providing services under our Fee-for-Service model in our timeshare business.
All of our businesses have both domestic and international operations. During 2018, we derived 89% of our revenues in the United States (“U.S.”) and 11% internationally. For a discussion of our segment revenues, profits, assets and geographical operations, see Note 23—Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Strategy
Following 2018’s successful launch of Wyndham Destinations as a separate company, we believe we are in a strong position to build on this momentum in 2019 and beyond. Our Wyndham Destinations strategic pillars serve to clarify our top priorities in order to enhance shareholder value and return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The four Strategic Pillars affirm our mindset that customers must dominate our focus, while also reflecting our relentless drive for superior sales and marketing, exceptional brands and products, as well as our commitment to operate all areas of the business with excellence. 
Our execution of this strategy is firmly anchored by our culture - the foundation comprised of the shared values, competencies and spirit of our global team. Aligned with our vision to put the world on vacation, our values are the HEART of Wyndham Destinations:  Hospitality, Engagement, Accountability, Respect, Teamwork. We recognize that our impact on customers, associates and communities strengthens lives. Wyndham Destinations thrives upon the commitment of our 24,000+ associates, and we foster a culture that unlocks the full potential for success as a company, and as individual and team contributors.  

1. | Customer Obsession

Far beyond a hospitality initiative, Customer Obsession is our global credo that the Wyndham Destinations team puts affiliates, owners, members and guests first in all areas of our business. Three straightforward guidelines support this focus and underscore our commitment to excellence in customer service:

• | Make It Easy reminds us of the fact that simple is better. Not only will it be easy to do business with us, we will pursue synergies within the company that benefit our customers. The alignment of our team, systems and operations enables us to deliver better customer experiences.


• | Know Our Customers reflects our priority to understand customer preferences, personalize engagement and fulfill expectations. By leveraging integrated data to tailor the content and channels of customer communications, we will customize connections at every opportunity.

5


• | Customer, Customer, Customer is all about keeping the customer at the center of our focus. Our commitment to listen and respond to feedback ensures that the voice of the customer drives our decisions.


2. | Best-in-Class Sales & Marketing

This strategy focuses on fueling the continued growth of Wyndham Destinations. We will remain globally relevant to travelers by staying committed to innovation and continuing to build and strengthen relationships with our customers. Four core elements define our goals and align with our pledge to treat all customers with respect and integrity: 

• | Blue Thread is our connection to Wyndham Hotels & Resorts and Wyndham Rewards loyalty program customers. The demographics of this significant consumer group are strongly aligned to our owner demographics, enabling us to fill our sales pipeline and deliver new vacation experiences to Wyndham loyalists.


• | Partnership Pipeline enables us to leverage the expertise of strategic partners to accelerate our growth and deliver enhanced benefits to our owners and members. We will strengthen and extend existing relationships, while developing new partners to reach untapped segments.


• | Digital & Customer Relationship Marketing will bring timeshare to the next generation. We will optimize technology to be relevant and compelling to meet our customers’ expectations and we will infuse transparency, speed and accuracy into our processes.


• | Sales Experience relates to the evolution of the places and processes that mark the journey of ownership. We will invest in bold transformations to revitalize the customer experience and drive customer engagement about vacations.


3. | Leading Brands & Offerings

This strategy is about creating a simple yet powerful narrative of who we are and what we sell. This effort began with the launch of Wyndham Destinations and continues with the refreshed branding of Club Wyndham and WorldMark by Wyndham. Three core elements define this strategy:

• | Brand Transformation shows our commitment to become even better at articulating the value proposition of each of our brands and making them relevant and enticing to our diverse owners, members and prospects.


• | Network Expansion means growing our portfolio to meet the needs of our customers. Not only is this about adding more locations, it’s also about keeping our products and services refreshed and cutting edge.


• | RCI Re-ignition will focus on leveraging the strengths of our iconic exchange brand to innovate while maintaining continued growth.


4. | Operating Excellence

This strategy is the business engine that enables our delivery of great vacations and optimal performance through aligned operations. Two core elements drive this strategy:

• | Resort Operating Excellence sustains our ability to provide great vacation experiences to our owners, members and guests. The strategic deployment of capital and reserves to maintain top quality resorts, combined with our optimal use of inventory, drives this cycle of excellence.


• | Prioritization reflects our disciplined operation as an integrated company. Our alignment around prioritized work and our management of general, administrative and overhead expenses relative to revenue growth fuels efficiency and effectiveness.

In summary, we believe that the successful execution of our business strategy will allow us to increase cash flows and profitability, creating more value for our shareholders. 
History and Development
Our corporate history can be traced back to the formation of Hospitality Franchise Systems (“HFS”) in 1990. HFS initially began as a hotel franchisor that later expanded to include the addition of the vacation exchange business. In December 1997, HFS merged with CUC International, Inc. to form Cendant Corporation, which then expanded further through the addition of vacation rentals and vacation ownership businesses. On July 31, 2006, Cendant distributed all of the shares of its subsidiary, Wyndham Worldwide, to the holders of Cendant common stock. On August 1, 2006, we commenced “regular way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WYN”.
6

On May 31, 2018, we completed the spin-off of our hotel business into a separate publicly traded company, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham Hotels”). This transaction was effected through a pro rata distribution of the new hotel entity’s stock to Wyndham Destinations shareholders. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into certain agreements with Wyndham Hotels to implement the legal and structural separation, govern the relationship between us and Wyndham Hotels up to and after the completion of the separation, and allocate various assets, liabilities and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, intellectual property and tax-related assets and liabilities between us and Wyndham Hotels. The two public companies have entered into long-term exclusive license agreements to retain their affiliations with one of the industry’s top-rated loyalty programs, Wyndham Rewards, as well as to continue to collaborate on inventory-sharing and customer cross-selling initiatives. 
RCI, our vacation exchange business, was established in 1974. Our vacation ownership brands began operations in 1978 with Shell Vacations Club, followed by Wyndham Vacation Resorts (formerly known as Fairfield Resorts) in 1980 and WorldMark by Wyndham (formerly known as Trendwest Resorts) in 1989.
Our portfolio of well-known hospitality brands was assembled over the past twenty-nine years. The following is a timeline of some of our acquisitions:

Year | Acquisition 
1996 | Resort Condominiums International (RCI)
2001 | Wyndham Vacation Resorts 
2002 | WorldMark by Wyndham 
 | Equivest 
2010 | ResortQuest 
2011 | The Resort Company 
 | Bahama Bay/Caribe Cove 
2012 | Shell Vacations Club 
 | Oceana Resorts 
 | Smoky Mountain Property Management 
2013 | Midtown 45, NYC Property 
2014 | Raintree Vacation Club (5 Properties) 
 | Hatteras Realty, Inc. 
2015 | Vacation Palm Springs 
 | ResortQuest Whistler 
2017 | Love Home Swap 
 | DAE Global Pty Ltd 

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS 
The following is a description of our two business segments, Vacation Ownership and Exchange & Rentals, and the industries in which they compete.
VACATION OWNERSHIP
Industry
The vacation ownership industry, also referred to as the timeshare industry, enables consumers to share ownership of a fully-furnished vacation accommodation. Typically, the consumer purchases either a title to a fraction of a unit or a right to use a property for a specific period of time. This is referred to as a Vacation Ownership Interest (“VOI”). VOIs are generally sold through weekly interval or points-based systems. Under a weekly interval system, owners can use a specific unit at a specific resort often during a specific week of the year. Under a points-based system, owners often have advance reservation rights for a particular destination, but are free to redeem their points for various unit types and/or locations. In addition, points owners can vary the length and frequency of product utilization. Once point values are established for particular units, they generally cannot be changed. For many purchasers, vacation ownership is an attractive alternative to traditional lodging accommodations at hotels. In addition to avoiding variability in room rates, timeshare owners also enjoy accommodations that are, on average, more than twice the size and typically have more features than traditional hotel rooms, such as kitchens, separate living areas and in-unit laundry.
7

Typically, developers sell VOIs for a fixed purchase price that is paid in full at closing or financed through developer-offered financing options. Vacation ownership resorts are often operated by a property owners’ association of which the VOI owners are members. Most property owners’ associations are governed by a board of directors that includes owners and which may include representatives of the developer. The board of the property owners’ association typically delegates much of the responsibility for managing the resort to a management company, which is often affiliated with the developer.
After the initial purchase, most vacation ownership programs require the owner to pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner’s allocable share of the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the vacation ownership property and providing program services. This fee typically covers expenses such as housekeeping, landscaping, taxes, insurance, resort labor, a management fee payable to the management company and an assessment to fund a reserve account used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, appliances, common areas and other assets, such as structural elements and equipment, as needed over time. Owners typically reserve their usage of vacation accommodations in advance through a reservation system. These reservation systems are often provided by the management company or an affiliated entity.
Market awareness and acceptance of vacation ownership products has grown with the entrance into the market of well-known lodging and entertainment brands, such as Wyndham, Marriott, Hilton and Disney. Additionally, the industry’s growth can also be attributed to stronger consumer protection laws and the evolution from primarily weekly intervals systems to points-based systems. According to the American Resort Development Association (“ARDA”), a trade association representing the vacation ownership and resort development industries, industry-wide sales were divided 73% for points-based systems and 27% for weekly intervals in 2017.
Based on published industry data, the primary reasons owners have expressed for buying and continuing to own their timeshare are as follows: 

• | saving money on future vacation costs;


• | location of resorts;


• | overall flexibility by allowing them the ability to use different locations, unit types and times of year;


• | certainty of vacations; and


• | certainty of quality accommodations.

According to a 2017 report issued by ARDA, domestic vacation ownership sales were approximately $9.2 billion in 2016, compared to $8.6 billion in 2015. Demographic factors explain, in part, the continued appeal of vacation ownership. A 2016 study of recent U.S. vacation ownership purchasers indicated that the average timeshare owner is 47 years old and has an average annual household income of $93,000. Nearly half of the respondents indicated they plan to buy or upgrade a timeshare over the next two years. This, along with other industry data, suggests that the typical purchaser in the U.S. has disposable income and is interested in purchasing vacation products. Although we believe baby boomers will continue to be active participants in the vacation ownership industry, this study notes that 41% of the respondents were Gen X’ers and 26% were Millennials and that the average age of new first-time purchasers was 43 years old with an average household income of $88,000. The data also suggests that Millennials’ perception of the industry and primary reasons for buying their timeshare is similar to the overall population of owners; however, they seek even more flexibility in using and accessing the product. Most owners can exchange their timeshare unit through exchange companies and through the applicable vacation ownership company’s internal network of properties. 
Vacation Ownership Overview
We operate the world’s largest vacation ownership business. We develop and acquire vacation ownership resorts, market and sell VOIs, provide consumer financing for the majority of the sales and provide property management services to property owners’ associations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 224 vacation ownership resorts in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Caribbean and South Pacific that represent more than 25,000 individual vacation ownership units and approximately 880,000 owners of VOIs.
Our brands primarily operate points-based vacation ownership systems through which VOIs can be redeemed for vacations that provide owners with flexibility as to resort location, length of stay, number of stays, unit type and time of year. Our programs allow us to market and sell our vacation ownership products in variable quantities and to offer existing owners “upgrade” sales to supplement their existing VOIs. Less than 1% of our VOI product sales are from traditional weekly interval systems.
Although we offer separate brands, we have integrated substantially all of the business functions, including consumer finance, information technology, staff functions, product development and marketing activities.

Revenues and Operating Statistics
Our vacation ownership business derives a majority of its revenues from timeshare sales, with the remainder of revenues coming from consumer financing and property management. Property management revenues are partly dependent on the number of units we manage.
Performance in our vacation ownership business is measured by the following key operating statistics:

• | Gross vacation ownership interest sales or VOIs - Sales of VOIs including Fee-for-Service sales before the effect of loan loss provisions.


• | Tours - Number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell VOIs.


• | Volume per guest or (“VPG”) - Gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. We have excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because non-tour upgrade sales are generated by a different marketing channel.

Vacation Ownership Brands
We operate under the following brands:
Club Wyndham. As one of Wyndham Destinations’ flagship vacation brands, Club Wyndham gives travelers the chance to live their bucket list and seek new adventures along the way. Spacious suites feature fully equipped kitchens, separate living and dining areas, private bedrooms, and on-site recreation facilities. Club Wyndham lets travelers experience the best of what the world has to offer, with 99 resorts in top destinations across North America, Brazil, the South Pacific and Caribbean.
WorldMark by Wyndham. WorldMark promises families more time to be together and more time for new traditions and new discoveries at a resort that feels like home. WorldMark suites provide all the amenities families need - including fully equipped kitchens, separate living and dining areas, separate bedrooms, and a washer/dryer. WorldMark by Wyndham offers a flexible vacation portfolio, with over 90 resorts in a variety of destinations across the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Asia-Pacific. 
Presidential Reserve by Wyndham. Travelers seeking an enhanced vacation experience distinguished by luxurious suites, exclusive amenities, guaranteed access and other special benefits will enjoy the first class experience provided by our Presidential Reserve by Wyndham.

Our multi-brand strategy allows us to deliver a broad range of vacation ownership products, locations and price points to a wide spectrum of travelers. Likewise, it also allows us to pursue development opportunities in a wide range of destinations, including international and urban markets. Having a diverse brand portfolio means we can select the most appropriate brand and development partners to expand our footprint. We have used this advantage to build the largest global footprint in the timeshare industry, with resorts across North America, Asia, the South Pacific and Caribbean.

Sales and Marketing
We employ a variety of marketing channels to encourage prospective owners of VOIs to tour our properties and attend sales presentations at our resort-based sales centers as well as off-site sales offices. Our resort-based sales centers also enable us to actively solicit upgrade sales to existing owners of VOIs while they vacation at our resorts. We operate a tele-sales program designed to market upgrade sales to existing owners of our products. Sales of VOIs relating to upgrades represented 62%, 65% and 67% of our net VOI sales during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
We use a variety of marketing programs to attract prospective owners, including sponsored contests that offer vacation packages or gifts, targeted mailings, outbound and inbound telemarketing efforts, and in association with Wyndham Hotels brands, other co-branded marketing programs and events. We also partner with Wyndham Hotels by utilizing the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program to offer Wyndham Rewards points as an incentive to prospective VOI purchasers, and by providing additional redemption options to Wyndham Rewards members. We co-sponsor sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional programs with professional teams at major sporting events and with other third parties at high-traffic consumer events. Where permissible under state law, we offer cash awards or other incentives to existing owners for referrals of new owners.
New owner acquisition is an important strategy for us as this will continue to maintain our pool of “lifetime” buyers of vacation ownership and thus enable us to solicit upgrade sales in the future. We believe the market for VOI sales is under-penetrated, and estimate that there are 53 million U.S. households that are potential purchasers of VOIs. We added approximately 37,000, 36,000 and 33,000 new owners during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Our marketing and sales activities are often facilitated through marketing alliances with other travel, hospitality, entertainment, gaming and retail companies that provide access to such companies’ customers through a variety of co-branded marketing offers. Our resort-based sales centers, which are located in popular travel destinations throughout the U.S., generate substantial tour flow by enabling us to market to tourists already visiting these destinations. Our marketing agents, who often operate on the premises of the hospitality, entertainment, gaming and retail companies with which we have alliances, solicit tourists with offers relating to entertainment activities and other incentives in exchange for the tourists visiting the local resorts and attending sales presentations.
An example of a marketing alliance through which we market to tourists visiting destination areas is our current arrangement with Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas, Nevada. This arrangement enables us to operate concierge-style marketing kiosks throughout select casinos and permits us to solicit patrons to attend sales presentations with casino-related rewards and entertainment offers, such as gaming chips, show tickets and dining certificates. We also operate our primary Las Vegas sales center within Harrah’s Casino Hotel, Las Vegas, and regularly shuttle prospective owners targeted by such sales centers to and from our nearby resort property.
10

Other marketing alliances provide us with the opportunity to align our marketing and sales programs with well-known lifestyle brands that appeal to consumers with similar demographics to our current purchasers. One such example is our alliance with Margaritaville, a lifestyle brand popularized by musician/entertainer Jimmy Buffett, where we market to patrons of various Margaritaville product lines via multiple channels, including on-site marketing at Margaritaville restaurants, affiliated venues and events, as well as co-branded vacation ownership offerings.
We offer a variety of entry-level programs and products as part of our sales strategy. For example, we have a program that allows prospective owners a one-time allotment of points or credits with no further obligations, which we refer to as our sampler program, and a biennial product that provides for vacations every other year. As part of our sales strategies, we rely on our points/credits-based programs, which provide prospective owners with the flexibility to buy relatively small packages of points or credits which can then be upgraded at a later date. To facilitate upgrade sales among existing owners, we market opportunities for owners to purchase additional points or credits through periodic marketing campaigns and promotions while those owners vacation at our properties.
Purchaser Financing
We offer financing to purchasers of VOIs which attracts additional customers and generates substantial incremental revenues and profits. We fund and service loans through our wholly-owned consumer financing subsidiary, Wyndham Consumer Finance. Wyndham Consumer Finance performs loan financing, servicing and related administrative functions. 
We typically perform a credit investigation or other inquiry into every purchaser’s credit history before offering to finance a portion of the purchase price of the VOI. The interest rate offered to participating purchasers is determined by an automated underwriting process based upon the purchaser’s credit score, and the amount of the down payment. We use a consumer credit score, Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”), which is a branded version of a consumer credit score widely used within the U.S. by the largest banks and lending institutions. FICO scores range from 300 to 850 and are calculated based on information obtained from one or more of the three major U.S. credit reporting agencies that compile and report on a consumer’s credit history. For purchasers with large loan balances, we maintain higher credit standards for new loan originations. Our weighted average FICO score on new originations was 727, 726 and 727 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
During 2018, we generated $1.5 billion of new receivables on $2.2 billion of gross vacation ownership sales, net of Fee-for-Service sales, resulting in 68% of our vacation ownership sales being financed. This level of financing is prior to the receipt of addenda cash. Addenda cash represents the cash received for full payment of a loan within 15 to 60 days of origination. After the application of addenda cash, we financed approximately 59% of vacation ownership sales during 2018.
We generally require a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price on all sales of VOIs and offer consumer financing for the remaining balance for up to 10 years. While the minimum down payment is generally 10%, our average down payment on financed sales of VOIs was 22% and 24% during 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in the average down payment in 2018 is attributable to lower down payment requirements to support our strategy to grow new members. These loans are structured with equal monthly installments that fully amortize the principal by the final due date.
Similar to many other companies that provide consumer financing, we have historically securitized a majority of the receivables originated in connection with the sales of VOIs. We initially place the financed contracts into a revolving warehouse securitization facility, generally within 30 to 90 days after origination. Many of the receivables are subsequently transferred from the warehouse securitization facility and placed into term securitization facilities.
Our consumer financing subsidiary is responsible for the maintenance of contract receivables files as well as all customer service, billing and collection activities related to the domestic loans we extend. We assess the performance of our loan portfolio by monitoring numerous metrics including collection rates, defaults by state of residency and bankruptcies. Our consumer financing subsidiary also manages the selection and processing of loans pledged or to be pledged in our warehouse and term securitization facilities. As of December 31, 2018, 95% of our loan portfolio was current (not more than 30 days past due).
Property Management
On behalf of each of the property owners’ associations, we or our affiliates generally provide day-to-day management for vacation ownership resorts, which includes oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance and refurbishment of the units, and provide certain accounting and administrative services to property owners’ associations. The terms of the property management agreements are generally between three to five years; however, the vast majority of the agreements provide a mechanism for automatic renewal upon expiration of the terms. In connection with these property management services, we 
11

receive fees which are generally based upon total costs to operate such resorts. Fees for property management services typically approximate 10% of budgeted operating expenses. As the owner of unsold VOIs, we pay maintenance fees in accordance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions in which the resorts are located. In addition, at certain newly-developed resorts, we sometimes enter into subsidy agreements with the property owners’ associations to cover costs that otherwise would be covered by annual maintenance fees payable with respect to VOIs that have not yet been sold.
Inventory Sourcing
We sell inventory sourced primarily through five channels:

• | self-developed inventory,


• | Just-in-Time inventory,


• | Fee-for-Service,


• | consumer loan defaults, and


• | inventory reclaimed from owners’ associations or owners.

Self-developed inventory. Under the traditional timeshare industry development model, we develop inventory specifically for our timeshare sales. The process often begins with the purchase of land which we then develop. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, this process can take up to several years; but usually takes less.
Just-in-Time inventory. Our Just-in-Time inventory acquisition model enables us to acquire and own completed units close to the timing of their sale or to acquire completed inventory from a third-party partner based upon a predetermined purchase schedule. This model significantly reduces the period between the deployment of capital to acquire inventory and the subsequent return on investment which occurs at the time of its sale to a timeshare purchaser. 
Fee-for-Service. In 2010, we introduced the first of our Fee-for-Service models. This timeshare sourcing model was designed to capitalize upon the large quantities of newly developed, nearly completed or recently finished condominium or hotel inventory in the real estate market without assuming the risk that accompanies property acquisition or new construction. This business model offers turn-key solutions for developers or banks in possession of newly developed inventory, which we sell for a fee through our extensive sales and marketing channels. Fee-for-Service enables us to expand our resort portfolio with little or no capital deployment, while providing additional channels for new owner acquisition and growth for our Fee-for-Service property management business.
Consumer loan defaults. As discussed in the “Purchaser Financing” section, we offer financing to purchasers of VOIs. In the event of a default, we are able to recover the inventory and resell it at full current value. We are responsible for the payment of maintenance fees to the property owners’ associations until the product is sold. As of December 31, 2018, Inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet included estimated inventory recoveries on loan defaults in the amount of $286 million.
Inventory reclaimed from owners’ associations or owners. We have entered into agreements with a majority of the property associations representing our developments where we may acquire properties related to owners who have defaulted on their maintenance fees, provided there is no outstanding debt on such properties. In addition, we frequently work with owners to acquire their properties, provided they have no outstanding debt on such properties, prior to those owners defaulting on their maintenance fees. This provides the owner with a graceful exit from a property that is no longer utilized due to lifestyle changes.
Strategies 
Our goal is to strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry and generate consistent and long-term value for our shareholders. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies:
Use our diverse brands to enter new and underpenetrated geographies and broaden our demographic reach. Our unique mix of brands coupled with our large, global footprint provides us with a strategic advantage when adding new inventory in target markets. We expect to use this advantage to grow our customer base by expanding our product offerings in existing markets and entering new, underpenetrated markets. 
In our existing markets, we intend to grow our product offerings by adding new brands, either within an existing resort or at a new development. By having multiple brands within a single location, we are able to offer different products at different price points, thereby increasing our addressable market. For example, in Las Vegas, our second and third brands represent over 40% of our sales. In Nashville, our ability to offer a lifestyle brand, Margaritaville Vacation Club by Wyndham, resulted in our selection as a partner in a new hotel development in the popular “SoBro” district. 
12

The breadth of our offerings also allows us to enter new markets with the appropriate brand and product mix. In our newest timeshare market, Austin, we offer two products, one targeted to new owners and the other targeted to existing owners, which allows us to appeal to a broader audience of customers. Additionally, we use our brand portfolio, combined with our strong sales and marketing platform, to penetrate non-traditional but attractive timeshare markets such as the Wisconsin Dells, where we are the only major hospitality brand. 
Increase new owner sales to drive long-term growth. We intend to increase the percentage of our VOI sales from new owners, which will enable us to drive long-term revenue and earnings growth. On average, new owners double their initial VOI purchase within seven years, resulting in predictable, high-margin future revenue streams. We will leverage our industry-leading sales and marketing platform to attract new owners by expanding our call transfer capabilities, leveraging our relationship with Wyndham Hotels, enhancing our marketing alliances, growing our Community Marketing Presence (“CMP”) and adding resorts in new markets. 
Maximize our relationship with Wyndham Hotels. We have a long-term, exclusive license agreement and marketing arrangements with Wyndham Hotels, the world’s largest hotel franchisor with approximately 8,900 affiliated hotels located in 80 countries. Since its redesign in 2015, Wyndham Hotels’ loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards, has won more than 70 awards, including “Best Hotel Loyalty Program” from US News & World Report and Most Rewarding Hotel Loyalty Program from IdeaWorks. 
We plan to significantly increase this sales channel with initiatives such as enhanced call transfers, online marketing, in-hotel marketing and online rentals of vacation ownership resorts. In addition, Wyndham Rewards redemption options into our resorts provide enhanced tour flow opportunities. Cross-marketing to existing guests of Wyndham Hotels and members of Wyndham Rewards has proven to be more efficient than traditional marketing efforts. Volume per guest (“VPG”) on affinity marketing tours is higher than other tours, helping to increase margins on new owner sales. We believe further developing this affinity relationship, which currently represents only a small portion of VOI sales, offers a significant new owner growth opportunity that is more profitable than other new owner marketing channels.
Wyndham Rewards, with approximately 61 million enrolled members, many of whom fit our target new customer demographic, provides us with a substantial customer sourcing opportunity to drive future VOI sales.
Maintain a capital-efficient inventory sourcing strategy to produce attractive returns and cash flow. Wyndham Vacation Ownership pioneered capital-efficient inventory sourcing in 2010. We have a diverse inventory sourcing model, including self-developed inventory, Just-in-Time inventory, Fee-for-Service inventory, and buyback programs that allow us to generate VOI sales. Our capital-efficient inventory sourcing strategy has significantly increased return on invested capital since 2010.
The scale and breadth of our brand and product offerings give us unparalleled access to inventory sources, including innovative capital-efficient opportunities, which gives us the ability to select the most attractive development options.
Seasonality
We rely, in part, upon tour flow to generate sales of VOIs; consequently, sales volume tends to increase in the spring and summer months as a result of greater tour flow from spring and summer travelers. Therefore, revenue from sales of VOIs are generally higher in the third quarter than in other quarters. 
Competition
The timeshare industry historically has been and continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. Competitors range from small vacation ownership companies to large branded hotel companies, all operating vacation ownership businesses involved in the development, finance and operation of timeshare properties.
Our vacation ownership business competes with other timeshare developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility for members to exchange into time at other timeshare properties or other travel rewards, including access to hotel loyalty programs, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. We also compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. There is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, in particular for sales and management. Our primary competitors in the timeshare space include Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Hilton Grand Vacations, Disney Vacation Club, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, Bluegreen Vacations and Diamond Resorts International. 
13

In addition, our timeshare business competes with other entities engaged in the leisure and vacation industry, including resorts, hotels, cruises and other accommodation alternatives, such as condominium and single-family home rentals. We also compete with home and apartment sharing services (such as AirBnB and VRBO) that operate websites that market available privately owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. In certain markets, we compete with established independent timeshare operators, and it is possible that other potential competitors may develop properties near our current resort locations. In addition, we face competition from other timeshare management companies in the management of resorts on behalf of owners on the basis of quality, cost, types of services offered and relationship.
The timeshare industry has experienced significant consolidation, which may increase competition. Additionally, competition in the vacation ownership industry may increase as private competitors become publicly traded companies or existing publicly traded competitors spin-off their vacation ownership operations, increasing the number of competitors in a highly fragmented industry.
For example, in September 2018, Marriot Vacations Worldwide acquired Interval Leisure Group, Inc., which operates the Interval International exchange program. Prior to that acquisition, Interval Leisure Group, Inc. had acquired Hyatt Residence Club in October 2014 and in May 2016 acquired the timeshare operations of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (which includes the use of Westin and Sheraton brands for timeshare purposes), known as Vistana Signature Experiences, Inc. Diamond Resorts International, Inc. completed the acquisition of the timeshare business of Gold Key Resorts in October 2015 and completed the acquisition of the timeshare business of Intrawest Resort Club Group in January 2016. 
In January 2017, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. completed the spin-off of its vacation ownership operations and Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. is now a separate publicly traded company. In November 2017, Bluegreen Vacations Corporation completed an initial public offering that resulted in approximately 10 percent of its stock being held by the public. Competitors that are publicly traded companies may benefit from a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital, as well as more focused management attention. 
Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. 
We generally do not face competition in our consumer financing business to finance sales of our VOIs. We do face competition from financial institutions providing other forms of consumer credit, which may lead to full or partial prepayment of our timeshare financing receivables. 
EXCHANGE & RENTALS
Industry
A large segment of leisure travel is delivered through non-hotel accommodations that include vacation exchange and vacation rentals. These non-hotel accommodations provide leisure travelers access to a wide variety of leisure options that include vacation ownership resorts, privately-owned vacation homes, apartments and condominiums.
Vacation exchange is a fee-for-service industry that offers services and products primarily to timeshare developers and owners. To participate in a vacation exchange, generally a timeshare owner deposits their interval from a resort or points from their club or resort into a vacation exchange company’s network and receives the opportunity to use another owner’s interval at a different destination. The vacation exchange company assigns a value to the owner’s deposit based upon a number of factors, including supply and demand for the destination, size of the timeshare unit, dates of the interval and the amenities at the resort. Vacation exchange companies generally derive revenues by charging fees for facilitating vacation exchanges and through annual membership dues. 
Vacation ownership clubs, such as Club Wyndham Plus, WorldMark by Wyndham, Hilton Grand Vacations and Disney Vacation Club, give members the option to exchange both internally, within their collection of resorts, or externally through vacation exchange networks such as RCI. These types of clubs have been the largest driver of vacation ownership industry growth over the past several years. This long-term trend has a positive impact on the average number of members, but a negative effect on the number of vacation exchange transactions per member and revenue per member as members exchange more often within their club.
Exchange & Rentals Overview
We operate the world’s largest vacation exchange network based on the number of members and are a leading provider of professionally managed vacation rentals in North America. Our mission is to send people on the vacation of their dreams and, during 2018, we sent approximately 7 million people to their desired destinations. Through our industry-leading tools, expertise and brands, we create connections between suppliers and guests to maximize supplier utilization and guest 
14

experience. We are largely a fee-for-service business with strong and predictable cash flows.
Our programs serve a member base of timeshare, fractional and whole-unit owners who want flexibility and variety in their travel plans each year. Through our collection of vacation exchange brands, we have approximately 3.8 million member families. We generally retain over 85% of our RCI members each year. In the vast majority of cases, we acquire new members when an affiliated timeshare developer pays for the initial term of a membership on behalf of a timeshare owner as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. Generally, this initial membership is for either a one or two year term, after which these new members may choose to renew directly with us. We also acquire a small percentage of new members directly from online channels. Club and corporate members receive the benefit of our vacation exchange program as part of their ownership with enrollment and renewals paid for by the developer. Members receive periodicals published by us and, for additional fees, use the applicable vacation exchange program and other services that provide members the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of a deposit, combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power and book travel services. 
Our vacation exchange business has relationships with over 4,300 vacation ownership resorts in approximately 110 countries and territories located in North America, Latin America, Caribbean, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. We tailor our strategies and operating plans for each region where we have, or seek to develop, a substantial member base.
Revenues and Operating Statistics
Our vacation exchange business derives the majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and fees for facilitating vacation exchanges and rentals. We also generate revenue from: (i) additional services, programs with affiliated resorts, club servicing and loyalty programs and (ii) additional products that provide members the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of deposits, and combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power. No one customer, developer or group accounts for more than 10% of our revenues.
Performance in our vacation exchange business is measured by the following key operating statistics:

• | Average number of members - Represents members in our vacation exchange programs who paid annual membership dues as of the end of the period or within the allowed grace period.


• | Exchange revenue per member - Represents total annualized revenues generated from fees associated with memberships, exchange transactions, member-related rentals and other servicing for the period divided by the average number of vacation exchange members during the period.

We also derive revenues from our North American vacation rentals business from (i) commissions earned on the rental of vacation rental properties on behalf of independent owners and (ii) additional property management services delivered to property owners, vacation rental guests and homeowners’ associations. During 2018, the Company decided to explore strategic alternatives for its North American vacation rentals business and during the fourth quarter commenced activities to facilitate the sale of this business. The assets and liabilities of this business have been classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018. This business does not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation; therefore, the results were reflected within continuing operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For further details see Note 7—Held-for-Sale Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Exchange and Rentals Brands
We operate under the following brands:
RCI. Founded in 1974, RCI operates the world’s largest vacation ownership weeks-based vacation exchange network, RCI Weeks, and provides members with the ability to exchange week-long intervals in units at their home resort for intervals at comparable resorts. RCI also operates the world’s largest vacation ownership points-based vacation exchange network, RCI Points. This program allocates points to use rights that members cede to the vacation exchange program. Members may redeem their points for the use of vacation properties for the duration they choose in our vacation exchange program or for discounts on other services and products which may change from time to time, such as airfare, car rentals, cruises, hotels and other accommodations. RCI also offers enhanced membership tiers (Gold and Platinum), which provide additional benefits to members.
The Registry Collection. Established in 2002, The Registry Collection vacation exchange program is the industry’s largest and first global vacation exchange network of luxury vacation accommodations. The luxury vacation accommodations in our network include fractional ownership resorts, higher-end vacation ownership resorts, condo-hotels and yachts. The Registry Collection program allows members to exchange their intervals for the use of other luxury vacation properties within the 
15

network for a fee and also offers access to other services and products at member preferred rates, such as cruises, yachts, adventure travel, hotels and other accommodations.
DAE. Founded in 1997, DAE is a leading direct-to-consumer model of vacation exchange with global operations. This member-direct vacation exchange program is open to all timeshare owners, regardless of the resort where they own. DAE offers weeks, points and club owners a simple exchange system with modest support services so they can enjoy resort style accommodations around the world.
Love Home Swap. Founded in 2011, Love Home Swap provides homeowners two ways to turn their home into vacation opportunities. Members have the option to: (i) swap time at their home directly with another member for time at their property or (ii) swap time at their home for points, which can be used at a later date to secure a stay at another member’s home. Love Home Swap has developed a sizeable footprint in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and has begun to establish a presence in the U.S. and Australia. 
Wyndham Vacation Rentals. Wyndham Vacation Rentals offers North America-based rental properties in over 50 beach, ski, mountain, theme park, golf and tennis destinations such as Florida, South Carolina, Colorado, Delaware, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Utah, California and British Columbia. It has more than 35 years of industry experience providing vacation rentals to travelers through recognized and established brands such as ResortQuest, Steamboat Resorts and Smoky Mountain Property Management. Wyndham Vacation Rentals is part of our North American Vacation Rentals business which has been classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018.
Inventory
The properties our business makes available to travelers include vacation ownership condominiums, fractional resorts, homes, yachts, private residence clubs and traditional hotel rooms. We offer travelers flexibility as to time of travel and a choice of lodging options. This flexibility also helps our affiliated resorts as it provides additional benefits to the vacation ownership product. We offer property owners marketing, booking, property management and quality control services.
We leverage inventory comprising of VOIs and independently owned properties across our network of brands to maximize value for affiliates, vacation exchange members, vacation rental property owners and guests. We also leverage our scale and global marketing expertise to enhance demand and drive occupancy across our network of destinations, including the ability to source vacation rental inventory for vacation exchange members.
We also provide industry-leading technology and revenue management expertise to optimize our network of destination inventory through automated tools and sophisticated yield management techniques and to provide inventory distribution to our network of affiliated resorts. Additionally, we have adapted our yield management technology to introduce a new vacation rental property recruiting tool and have implemented the tool throughout our North American vacation rental operations.
Customer Development
We affiliate with vacation ownership developers directly through our in-house sales teams. Affiliated developers sign agreements that have an average duration of approximately five years. Our members are acquired primarily through our affiliated developers as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. We also acquire a small percentage of our members directly from online channels.
At our vacation rental brands, we primarily enter into exclusive annual rental agreements with property owners. We market these rental properties online and offline to large databases of customers. Additional customers are sourced through transactional websites and offline advertising and promotions, and through the use of third-party travel agencies, tour operators and online distribution channels to drive additional occupancy. We have a number of specific branded websites to promote, sell and inform new customers about vacation rentals.
Loyalty Program
RCI’s loyalty program, RCI Elite Rewards, offers a co-branded credit card to our members. The card allows members to earn reward points that can be redeemed for items related to our RCI vacation exchange programs, including annual membership dues, exchange fees for transactions, and other services and products offered by RCI or certain third parties, including airlines and retailers.
Our vacation rental brands also participate in the industry’s leading loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards. During 2018, we made approximately 6,300 vacation rental properties available for redemption through Wyndham Rewards and will continue 
16

incorporating properties into the program in the years to come. We expect Wyndham Rewards to increase awareness of our vacation rental brands and drive incremental revenue.
Distribution
We distribute our products and services through proprietary websites and call centers around the world. We invest in new technologies and online capabilities to ensure that our customers have the best experience and access to consistent information and services across digital and call center channels. We continue to enhance our digital channels, mobile capabilities and e-commerce platforms across our network.
Important technology enhancements include streamlined search and transaction journeys, improved help and mobile functionality, more robust redesigned website content, and personalized content and offers for our customers. Recognizing that today’s on-the-go customer relies on mobile devices more frequently than ever before, we are further investing in our mobile apps and mobile browsers based on the latest technologies coupled with a more nuanced understanding of customer behavior. We have incorporated new tools and responsive designs that take advantage of the portability and variability of mobile devices, allowing customers to research and plan activities, going beyond the travel booking transaction alone.
Part of our vacation rental strategy has been to enhance and expand our online distribution channels, including global partnerships with several industry-leading online travel and vacation rental portals in order to streamline inventory connectivity and guest experience. This will continue to accelerate revenue growth and allow for more business on the web instead of through our call centers, thus generating cost savings for us.
The requests we receive at our global call centers are handled by our vacation guides, who are trained to fulfill requests for vacation exchange and rentals. Call centers remain an important distribution channel for us and therefore we continue to invest resources to ensure that members and rental customers receive a high level of personalized customer service. Through our call centers, we also provide private-labeled reservation booking, customer care and other services for our RCI affiliates.
Marketing
We market our services and products to our customers using our five primary consumer brands and other related brands in more than 130 offices worldwide through several marketing channels including direct mail, email, social media, telemarketing, online distribution channels, brochures and magazines. Our core marketing strategy is to personalize and customize our marketing to best match customer preferences. We have a comprehensive social and mobile media platform including apps for smartphones and tablets, Facebook and Pinterest fan pages, several Twitter and Instagram accounts and YouTube channels, online video content and various online magazines. We use our resort directories and periodicals related to the vacation industry for marketing as well as for member retention and loyalty. Additionally, we promote our offerings to owners of resorts and vacation homes through trade shows, online and other marketing channels that include direct mail and telemarketing.
Strategies
Our strategy is to re-ignite the RCI exchange brand to continue our growth and take advantage of untapped market demand. We will leverage RCI’s legacy of innovation, technology and analytics expertise to achieve our goals. We intend to pursue the following key strategic initiatives:
Identify new capital-efficient sources of supply to increase vacation opportunities for our customers
We plan to leverage our scale and robust industry relationships to secure new sources of supply with favorable pricing in order to enhance our exchange inventory profile. We have identified customer demand for destinations where we have limited point-in-time supply availability and demand for vacation opportunities available for confirmation closer to the vacation start date.
Offer new and innovative products to further enhance the membership experience and reach new customer bases
We plan to continue our history of innovation by offering more ways for customers to use their timeshare ownership to travel and vacation. Our goal is to make it easier for members to deposit future year VOIs into our exchange programs and allow members to use their vacation ownership toward discounts on other vacation-related opportunities. In addition, RCI will leverage our exchange platform and expertise to expand into new membership models and offerings, expanding our member base and demographic reach. We will also continue to enhance and grow DAE and Love Home Swap towards this end. 
Develop new solutions in partnership with our Club affiliates to increase overall engagement with the Club member population
While Club owners have been the largest growing segment of our member base, Club revenue per member is lower than our overall average due to a wide array of vacation options within the Clubs causing a reduced propensity for Club owners to 
17

interact with our external exchange networks. We see opportunity to improve this propensity by working more closely with our Club affiliate partners to drive additional value proposition in their owner base. We can achieve this by providing innovative new product offerings and time flexibility to help these owners avoid expiration of their Club currency by depositing into our exchange programs.
Grow market share through focus on geographic expansion and deeper penetration in existing markets
We will continue to leverage our best-in-class business development team to identify affiliation growth opportunities in our core markets, while investing in growth in our Latin America and Asia markets. 
Seasonality
Our revenues from vacation exchange fees have traditionally been higher in the first quarter, which is generally when our vacation exchange members plan and book their vacations for the year. Revenues from vacation rentals have traditionally been highest in the third quarter, when vacation arrivals are highest.
Competition
Exchange & Rentals competes globally with other vacation exchange companies, most notably Interval International, and certain developers and clubs that offer vacation exchange through their own internal networks of properties. Our vacation exchange business also competes with third-party internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks that are used by consumers to search for and book their resort and other travel accommodations. Our vacation rental brands face competition from a broad variety of professional vacation rental managers, most of which are small regional operators and individual property owners who pursue the rent-by-owner model, collectively using brokerage services, direct marketing and the internet to market and rent their vacation properties.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, domain names and other proprietary rights. The foregoing segment descriptions specify the brands that are used by each of our segments. Our subsidiaries actively use or license for use all significant marks and domain names, and we own or have exclusive licenses to use these marks and domain names. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a license, development and noncompetition agreement with Wyndham Hotels, which, among other things, granted to Wyndham Destinations the right to use the “Wyndham” trademark, “The Registry Collection” and certain other trademarks and intellectual property in our business. See “Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off—License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement” for more information. We register the marks that we own in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with other relevant authorities where we deem appropriate, and seek to protect our marks from unauthorized use as permitted by law.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our business is subject to various international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate. Some laws, regulations and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations under the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect one of our areas of business: inventory sourcing activities; sales and marketing activities; purchaser financing activities; and property management activities.
Inventory Sourcing Regulation
Our inventory sourcing activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder, which we refer to collectively as (the “ADA”). In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer.
18

Sales and Marketing Regulation
Our sales and marketing activities are highly regulated. In addition to regulations implementing laws enacted specifically for the timeshare industry, a wide variety of laws and regulations govern our sales and marketing activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state “Little FTC Act” and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, real estate, title agency or insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach notification, information sharing and telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws, securities laws, and other consumer protection laws.
We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our sales and marketing activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. In addition, many jurisdictions, including many jurisdictions in the United States, require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing information regarding our VOIs, such as information concerning the intervals being offered, the project, resort or program to which the intervals relate, applicable timeshare plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser’s rights and obligations with respect to such intervals, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such intervals.
When we sell VOIs, local law grants the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us.
In recent years, regulators in many jurisdictions have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring adherence to the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and “do not call” legislation. These measures have significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing, in particular with respect to telemarketing to mobile numbers. While we continue to be subject to telemarketing risks and potential liability, we believe that our exposure to adverse effects from telemarketing legislation and enforcement is mitigated in some instances by the use of permission-based marketing in which we obtain permission to contact prospective purchasers in the future. We have also implemented procedures to comply with federal and state “do not call” regulations including subscribing to the federal do not call registry and certain state “do not call” registries as well as maintaining an internal “do not call” list.
Purchaser Financing Regulation
Our purchaser financing activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory agencies such as, in the United States, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Credit Practices rules, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemember’s Civil Relief Act and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our purchaser financing activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering.
Property Management Regulation
Our property management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming and the environment (including climate change). In addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for property owners’ associations.
EMPLOYEES 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 24,500 employees, including over 4,300 employees outside of the U.S. The Vacation Ownership business had over 18,800 employees, Exchange & Rentals over 5,400 employees, and our corporate group 
19

had approximately 300 employees. Approximately 1% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
Our compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Wyndham Destinations is committed to delivering shareholder and stakeholder value through our Social Responsibility program, which remains an integral part of our company culture and global business operations. We strive to cultivate an inclusive environment, in which our associates, customers, suppliers and communities feel appreciated, respected and valued. In 2018, the Company continued to strengthen our impact across our five core areas of Social Responsibility: Environmental Sustainability, Inclusion & Diversity, Philanthropy, Ethics and Human Rights. 
We are committed to remaining a leader of sustainable business practices and we continue to work toward meeting all social responsibility regulations in which we conduct business. Our goal for 2025 is to reduce our carbon emissions by 40% and water consumption by 25% at our owned, managed and leased assets (based on square foot intensity) compared to our 2010 baseline. We have reduced carbon emissions intensity by 31% and water usage intensity by 22%, to our baseline, while increasing our overall portfolio square footage by 15%. Our goals will be achieved through innovative programs and the implementation of efficiency projects to reduce our carbon footprint. Progress towards our goals will be measured through our environmental data tracking tool. We recently exceeded our goal to plant one million trees through the Arbor Day Foundation, which has helped us to improve our biodiversity footprint. We continue to work with the Arbor Day foundation planting on average 200,000 trees per year and sourcing carbon neutral coffee.
KEY AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF
This section summarizes the material agreements between us and Wyndham Hotels that govern the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Spin-off. Additional or modified agreements, arrangements and transactions, which would be negotiated at arm’s length, may be entered into between us and Wyndham Hotels in the future. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, which are filed as exhibits hereto.
As of May 31, 2018 when the Spin-off was completed, we and Wyndham Hotels operate independently, and neither company has any ownership interest in the other. Before the Spin-off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with Wyndham Hotels related to the Spin-off. These agreements govern the relationship between us and Wyndham Hotels following completion of the Spin-off and provide for the allocation between us and Wyndham Hotels of various assets, liabilities, rights and obligations. The following is a summary of the terms of the material agreements we entered into with Wyndham Hotels. The following summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement, which is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibits 2.5, 10.46, 10.72, 10.73 and 10.74.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
The Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with Wyndham Hotels regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the Spin-off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for the allocation of assets and liabilities between Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels and establishes certain rights and obligations between the parties following the Distribution.

Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for those transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities that are necessary in connection with the Spin-off so that each of Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels is allocated the assets necessary to operate its respective business and retains or assumes the liabilities allocated to it in accordance with the separation plan. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provides for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels. In particular, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that, subject to certain terms and conditions: 

• | The assets that have been retained by or transferred to Wyndham Hotels (“SpinCo assets”) include, but are not limited to:


• | all of the equity interests of Wyndham Hotels;

20


• | any and all assets reflected on the audited combined balance sheet of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts businesses;


• | any and all contracts primarily relating to the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts businesses; and


• | all rights in the “Wyndham” trademark and “The Registry Collection” trademark, and certain intellectual property related thereto.


• | The liabilities that have been retained by or transferred to Wyndham Hotels (“SpinCo liabilities”) include, but are not limited to:


• | any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) to the extent primarily related to, arising out of or resulting from (a) the operation or conduct of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts businesses or (b) the SpinCo assets;


• | any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) relating to, arising out of or resulting from any form, registration statement, schedule or similar disclosure document filed or furnished with the Commission, to the extent such filing is either made by Wyndham Hotels or made by the Company in connection with the Spin-off, subject to each party’s indemnification obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement with respect to any misstatement of or omission to state a material fact contained in any such filing to the extent the misstatement or omission is based upon information that was furnished by such party;


• | any and all liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any indebtedness of Wyndham Hotels or any indebtedness secured exclusively by any of the Wyndham Hotels assets; and


• | any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) reflected on the audited combined balance sheet of the Wyndham Hotels & Resorts businesses.


• | Wyndham Hotels assumes one-third and Wyndham Destinations assumes two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of the Company (“shared contingent liabilities”) in each case incurred prior to the Distribution, including liabilities of the Company related to, arising out of or resulting from (i) certain terminated or divested businesses, (ii) certain general corporate matters of the Company and (iii) any actions with respect to the separation plan or the Distribution made or brought by any third party;


• | Wyndham Hotels is entitled to receive one-third and Wyndham Destinations is entitled to receive two-thirds of the proceeds (or, in certain cases, a portion thereof) from certain contingent and other corporate assets of the Company (“shared contingent assets”) arising or accrued prior to the Distribution, including assets of the Company related to, arising from or involving (i) certain terminated or divested businesses and (ii) certain general corporate matters of the Company;


• | In connection with the sale of the Company’s European vacation rentals business, Wyndham Hotels will assume one-third and Wyndham Destinations will assume two-thirds of certain shared contingent liabilities and certain shared contingent assets. Such shared contingent assets and shared contingent liabilities will include: (a) any amounts paid or received by Wyndham Destinations in respect of any indemnification claims made in connection with such sale, (b) any losses actually incurred by Wyndham Destinations or Wyndham Hotels in connection with its provision of post-closing credit support to the European vacation rentals business, in the form of an unsecured guarantee, letter of credit or otherwise, in a fixed amount to be determined, to ensure that the European vacation rentals business meets the requirements of certain service providers and regulatory authorities, and (c) any tax assets or liabilities related to such sale;


• | Except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, the corporate costs and expenses relating to the Spin-off will first be paid by the party such costs were incurred by, from a separate account maintained by each of Wyndham Hotels and Wyndham Destinations and established prior to completion of the Spin-off on terms agreed upon by Wyndham Hotels and Wyndham Destinations and, to the extent the funds in such separate account are not sufficient to satisfy such costs and expenses, be treated as shared contingent liabilities (as described above); and


• | All assets and liabilities of the Company (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than the SpinCo assets and SpinCo liabilities, subject to certain exceptions (including the shared contingent assets and shared contingent liabilities), have been retained by or transferred to Wyndham Destinations, except as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or one of the other agreements described below.

The allocation of liabilities with respect to taxes, except for payroll taxes and reporting and other tax matters expressly covered by the Employee Matters Agreement or the Separation and Distribution Agreement, are solely covered by the Tax Matters Agreement.

21

Net Proceeds Adjustment. Prior to the Distribution, Wyndham Hotels and the Company agreed on a target amount for the net proceeds to be received by the Company in connection with the sale of the Company’s European vacation rentals business. Following the Distribution, Wyndham Destinations will prepare, and agree with Wyndham Hotels on, a statement setting forth the actual amount of net proceeds received by the Company in connection with such sale, including pursuant to any post-closing purchase price adjustments. If the amount of actual net proceeds is greater than the target net proceeds amount, such excess will be a shared contingent asset; if it is less than the target net proceeds amount, such deficit will be a shared contingent liability.
Net Indebtedness Adjustment. Prior to the Distribution, the Company and Wyndham Hotels agreed on a target amount of indebtedness (net of cash) for Wyndham Hotels as of the Distribution. Following the Distribution, Wyndham Hotels will prepare, and agree with Wyndham Destinations on, a statement setting forth the actual amount of net indebtedness of Wyndham Hotels as of the close of business on the Distribution Date (as defined below). If the actual amount of net indebtedness as of the close of business on the Distribution Date is greater than the target net indebtedness amount, Wyndham Destinations will pay the difference to Wyndham Hotels; if it is less than the target net indebtedness amount, Wyndham Hotels will pay the difference to Wyndham Destinations.

Cash Balances. In connection with the transfer from the Company to Wyndham Hotels of certain liabilities as part of the internal reorganization, the Company transferred an agreed upon amount of cash to Wyndham Hotels. Also prior to the completion of the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels distributed or otherwise transferred to a bank account of the Company the amount of cash and cash equivalents in excess of the sum of (i) such amount of transferred cash, plus (ii) an amount of cash necessary to adequately capitalize Wyndham Hotels following the Spin-off, (iii) plus the amount of cash being maintained by Wyndham Hotels in a separate account to pay corporate costs and expenses relating to the Spin-off (as described above), plus the amount of certain cash proceeds from Wyndham Hotels’ offering of its 5.375% Notes due 2026 and the borrowings under Wyndham Hotels’ new senior secured credit facilities. Such distributed cash constitutes “boot” that is subject to the applicable requirements set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Amounts payable between the Company and Wyndham Hotels that are described in this paragraph may be netted and offset pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Further Assurances. To the extent that any transfers of assets or assumptions of liabilities contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement have not been consummated, the parties have agreed to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such transfers or assumptions as promptly as practicable. In addition, each of the parties has agreed to cooperate with each other and use commercially reasonable efforts to take or to cause to be taken all actions, and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary under applicable law or contractual obligations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements.

Representations and Warranties. In general, neither the Company nor Wyndham Hotels made any representations or warranties regarding any assets or liabilities transferred or assumed, any consents or approvals that may have been required in connection with such transfers or assumptions, the value or freedom from any lien or other security interest of any assets transferred, the absence of any defenses relating to any claim of either party or the legal sufficiency of any conveyance documents, or any other matters. Except as expressly set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or in any ancillary agreement, all assets have been transferred on an “as is, where is” basis.

The Distribution. The Separation and Distribution Agreement governs certain rights and obligations of the parties regarding the Distribution and certain actions that occurred prior to the Distribution, such as the election of officers and directors and the adoption of Wyndham Hotels’ amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws. Prior to the Distribution, the Company delivered all the issued and outstanding shares of Wyndham Hotels common stock to the distribution agent. Following the Distribution Date, the distribution agent will electronically deliver the shares of Wyndham Hotels common stock to the Company’s stockholders based on each holder of Company common stock receiving one share of Wyndham Hotels common stock for each share of Company common stock held as of May 18, 2018.

Intercompany Accounts. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that, subject to any provisions in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement to the contrary, prior to the Distribution, intercompany accounts were settled as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement.

Release of Claims and Indemnification. Wyndham Destinations and Wyndham Hotels have agreed to broad releases pursuant to which each releases the other and certain related persons specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement from any claims against any of them that arise out of or relate to events, circumstances or actions occurring or failing to occur or alleged 
22

to occur or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to exist at or prior to the time of the Distribution. These releases are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements.
The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Hotels’ business with Wyndham Hotels, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Destinations’ business with Wyndham Destinations. Specifically, each party will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and subsidiaries and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents for any losses arising out of, by reason of or otherwise in connection with: 

• | the liabilities each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement;


• | any misstatement of or omission to state a material fact contained in any party’s public filings, only to the extent the misstatement or omission is based upon information that was furnished by the indemnifying party (or incorporated by reference from a filing of such indemnifying party) and then only to the extent the statement or omission was made or occurred after the Spin-off; and


• | any breach by such party of the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement unless such ancillary agreement expressly provides for separate indemnification therein, in which case any such indemnification claims will be made thereunder.


The amount of each party’s indemnification obligations are subject to reduction by any insurance proceeds received by the party being indemnified. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also specifies procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters. Except in the case of tax assets and liabilities related to the sale of the Company’s European vacation rentals business, indemnification with respect to taxes are governed solely by the Tax Matters Agreement.

Insurance. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for the allocation among the parties of benefits under existing insurance policies for occurrences prior to the Distribution and sets forth procedures for the administration of insured claims. The Separation and Distribution Agreement allocates among the parties the right to proceeds and the obligation to incur deductibles under certain insurance policies. In addition, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that Wyndham Destinations will obtain, subject to the terms of the agreement, certain directors and officers liability insurance policies, fiduciary liability insurance policies and errors and omissions and cyber liability insurance policies to apply against certain pre-separation claims, if any.

Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising out of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the general counsels of the parties, and/or such other representatives as the parties designate, will negotiate to resolve any disputes among such parties. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute in this manner within a specified period of time, as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, then unless agreed otherwise by the parties, the dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration.

Other Matters Governed by the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Other matters governed by the Separation and Distribution Agreement include access to financial and other information, confidentiality, access to and provision of records and treatment of outstanding guarantees and similar credit support.
Employee Matters Agreement
We have entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Wyndham Hotels that will govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Wyndham Hotels and us following the Spin-off. The Employee Matters Agreement addresses the allocation of employees between Wyndham Hotels and us, defined benefit pension plans, qualified defined contribution plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans, employee health and welfare benefit plans, incentive plans, equity-based awards, collective bargaining agreements and other employment, compensation and benefits-related matters. The Employee Matters Agreement provides for, among other things, the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities related to incentive plans, retirement plans and employee health and welfare benefit plans in which transferred employees participated prior to the Spin-off. The Employee Matters Agreement also provides for the treatment of Wyndham Destinations’ outstanding equity-based awards in connection with the Spin-off. Following the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels employees no longer participate in Wyndham Destinations' plans or programs (other than continued participation in employee health and welfare benefit plans for a limited period of time following the Spin-off in conjunction with the Transition Services Agreement described below), and Wyndham Hotels will establish plans or programs for their employees as described in the Employee Matters Agreement. Wyndham Hotels will also establish or maintain plans and programs outside of the United States as may be required under applicable law or pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement.
23

Tax Matters Agreement
We have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Wyndham Hotels that will govern the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Wyndham Hotels and us following the Spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. As a former subsidiary of Wyndham Destinations, Wyndham Hotels has (and will continue to have following the Spin-off) joint and several liability with us to the IRS for the combined U.S. federal income taxes of the Wyndham Destinations consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which Wyndham Hotels was part of that group. In general, the Tax Matters Agreement specifies that Wyndham Hotels will bear one-third, and Wyndham Destinations two-thirds, of this tax liability, and Wyndham Hotels has agreed to indemnify us against any amounts for which we are not responsible including subject to the next sentence. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the Spin-off is not tax-free. In general, if a party's actions cause the Spin-off not to be tax-free, that party will be responsible for the payment of any resulting tax liabilities (and will indemnify the other party with respect thereto). The Tax Matters Agreement provides for certain covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue strategic or other transactions that otherwise could maximize the value of our business. Although valid as between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement will not be binding on the IRS.
Transition Services Agreement
We have entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Wyndham Hotels under which Wyndham Hotels will provide us with certain services, and we will provide Wyndham Hotels with certain services, for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the distribution.
The services that Wyndham Hotels has agreed to provide us under the Transition Services Agreement and that we have agreed to provide Wyndham Hotels includes certain finance, information technology, human resources, payroll, tax and other services. We pay Wyndham Hotels for any such services used at agreed amounts as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, from time to time during the term of the agreement, we and Wyndham Hotels may mutually agree on additional services to be provided.
The services provided under the Transition Services Agreement are, generally, to be provided for a term of up to 24 months following the distribution. Each party may terminate any transition services upon prior notice to the other party, generally with notice 45 days in advance of the desired termination date, and are generally to be responsible for any costs incurred by the non-terminating party as a result of such termination. Each party also has the right to terminate the agreement if the other party breaches any of its obligations under the agreement, subject to providing notice and opportunity to cure, solely with respect to service or services impacted by the breach.
The transition services are to be provided in a manner, and at a level of service, substantially similar to the manner and at the level of service with which the services were provided during the 12-month period prior to the distribution. The charge for these services are, generally, to be intended to allow the parties to recover all of their direct and indirect costs incurred in connection with providing those services.
The Transition Services Agreement generally provides that each party bears its own risks with respect to the receipt and provision of the transition services, with limited exceptions for items such as the other party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement
In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a license, development and noncompetition agreement with Wyndham Hotels, which, among other things, granted to Wyndham Destinations the right to use the “Wyndham” trademark, “The Registry Collection” and certain other trademarks and intellectual property in our business. This right is generally limited to use in connection with our vacation ownership, vacation rental (in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Caribbean) and vacation exchange businesses, with certain limited exceptions. This agreement has a term of 100 years with an option for us to extend the term for an additional 30 years. We will pay Wyndham Hotels certain royalties and other fees under this agreement. 
Additionally, the license, development and noncompetition agreement governs arrangements between us and Wyndham Hotels with respect to the development of new projects and non-compete obligations. These non-compete obligations restrict each of the Company and Wyndham Hotels from competing with the other party's business (subject to customary carve-outs) for the first 25 years of the term of the license, development and noncompetition agreement, and we may extend the term of these non-compete obligations for an additional 5-year term if we achieve a certain sales target in the last full calendar year of the initial 25-year term. If either party acquires a business that competes with the other party's businesses, Wyndham Hotels or us, respectively, must offer the other party the right to acquire such competing business upon and subject to the terms and 
24

conditions set forth in the license, development and noncompetition agreement. Additionally, if either party engages in a project that has a component that competes with the other party's businesses, Wyndham Hotels or us, respectively, must use commercially reasonable efforts to include the other party in such project, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the license, development and noncompetition agreement.
