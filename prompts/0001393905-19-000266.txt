BUSINESS OF CELL MEDX
 
eBalance Technology Acquisition
 
We acquired our proprietary technology for the use of microcurrents for the treatment of diabetes and related ailments, which we call eBalance Technology, on November 25, 2014, when we entered into a Technology Purchase Agreement with Jean Arnett and Bradley Hargreaves (the Purchase Agreement).
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves sold to us all of their respective rights, title and interests in and to the eBalance Technology. In consideration for the sale of the eBalance Technology, we paid Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves a total of $100,000 and issued to each of Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves options for the purchase of up to 10,000,000 shares (20,000,000 shares in total) of our common stock at an initial exercise price of $0.05 per share (the Options) of which Options to acquire up to 2,500,000 shares of our common stock vested on August 26, 2015, remaining Options were cancelled pursuant to a letter agreement with Ms. Arnett and Mr. Hargreaves, dated for reference September 26, 2016.
 
eBalance Technology
 
eBalance Technology is based on the science of bioelectric signals, their affect on epigenetic events within human body, and ability to modify and affect the behavior of cells, tissue, and organs. Based on this technology Cell MedX is developing a radically different and very promising family of devices whose core technology demarcates it from the approaches currently in use and those in the future advances pipeline as reflected in current medical literature.
 
Microcurrent delivery devices used for the treatment of various ailments have been in the marketplace for decades. However, the eBalance Technology can be distinguished from those devices, which have a limited utility and are not designed to treat various ailments at their core. It is hoped that devices based on the eBalance Technology will effect metabolic changes much further upstream in the pathophysiology or natural history of an ailment.
 
The eBalance Technology is intended to expand the traditional healthcare model of managing various pathological diseases and ailments, such as diabetes, Parkinsons disease, neuropathy, poor kidney function, high blood pressure, as well as some others, by enabling patients to manage their symptoms using a biosignal generating device that is simple to use, causes no discomfort, and can easily be incorporated into any lifestyle.
 
A research and development plan adopted by the Company includes a series of investigations that allow to move the product from a prototype stage through a series of refinements and enhancements to achieve the safety and efficacy objectives of the device(s) upon which a set of claims intended for FDA, Health Canada and European Medical CE approval through the rigorous Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process is being constructed. The clinical observational trial the Company finalized during its Fiscal 2018 (the Clinical Study), and future planned clinical trials (see Clinical Trials, below) will allow us to define the final marketing claims for our eBalance products, and will become the foundation for sales & marketing efforts in subsequent phases. The results of the Clinical Study and our in-house observations of the effects of the eBalance technology on human body, suggest that our claims may include diabetes management, reductions in average blood sugar (HbA1C), improvement of other markers that denote the degree and quality of blood sugar control, pain management, blood pressure control, and alleviation of symptoms associated with Parkinsons disease, among several others.
 
Scientific Foundations
 
Ion flows and transmembrane gradients produced by ion channels and pumps are key regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Instructive roles for bioelectrical gradients in embryogenesis, regeneration, and neoplasm are being revealed.
 
The application of electromagnetic forces to human tissues to effect biologic change has been explored since the 19th century. A good deal of that was wishful thinking or deliberate deception. However, recent advances in molecular biology and imaging technology have allowed insight into the sources and downstream consequences of ion flows in complex organisms.

In complement to the current focus on molecular genetics and stem cell biology, artificial modulation of bioelectrical signals in somatic tissues is a powerful modality that might result in profound advances in understanding and augmentation of regenerative capacity. Molecular bioelectricity and its role in cell-to-cell signaling and epigenetics (altering cell behavior without altering genes) provides a new pathway to discovery of technologies that can counteract the effects of many diseases.
 
Many cells in the human body are electrically excitable including those involved with production of chemical signals that affect blood sugar. One example of such a cell of the endocrine type is the L cell, which resides in the gut and secretes cell glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin. GLP-1 is an enteric hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and improves glycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that in Type 2 diabetes these cells become unsynchronized. Growing these cells in tissue culture and subjecting them to specific electrical signals can act to resynchronize their chemical activity, and alter their behavior as a dispersed metabolic organ. This serves as an illustration of how endogenous ion flows may serve as key epigenetic regulators of cell behavior, and suggests that bioelectric mechanisms might be harnessed at a whole organism level to cause functional regenerative changes. It is possible that the eBalance Technology may affect these processes, although that has yet to be established. We intend to explore this hypothesis in greater detail during our future clinical trials.
 
Market Opportunity - Diabetes and Its Complications
 
Diabetes care is one of the main opportunities the Company sees for the use of its eBalance Technology. Diabetes care was also a main objective of the Companys first clinical observational trial. Diabetes is a severe and debilitating disease with profound consequences, both for the individual and for society. The complications of diabetes are devastating, and the economic costs of care comprise a substantial portion of health care budgets. Despite the best efforts of the scientific community to devise a cure, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. According to the information published by International Diabetes Association (IDA) in its Diabetes Atlas[1], in 2015 there were 415 million people living with diabetes worldwide and a further 318 million people were at high risk of developing diabetes. These numbers were expected to grow to 642 million and 481 million, respectively, by 2040. It is estimated that each year 86,000 new cases of juvenile diabetes are being diagnosed.
 
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) with impaired metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and proteins resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is one of the worlds oldest diseases with the syndrome being discovered centuries ago. The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes has highlighted the need for increased research efforts into treatment options for both the disease itself and its associated complications.
 
Type 1 diabetes is caused by destruction of the insulin secreting (beta) cells of the pancreas. The pathogenesis involves autoimmune processes that lead to an absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that result in insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Non-genetic factors include increasing age, high caloric intake, obesity, central adiposity, sedentary lifestyle, and low birth weight. This group comprises approximately 90-95% of cases in the diabetes syndrome.
 
Chronic hyperglycemia leads to various metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic alterations in the body, which further develop a number of secondary complications, resulting in the major increases in morbidity and mortality seen with all types of diabetes. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as coronary artery disease, chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.
 
High blood sugar over time can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish nerves, especially in the legs, causing tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Gradually, all sensation can be lost. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. In diabetics, minor wounds easily become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation.

Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. It also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetic hypertension is a major contributor to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which often requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.
 
Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes may leave people more susceptible to a variety of skin disorders, including bacterial and fungal infections. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
 
Expansion of Disease Focus
 
Given the size of the market for diabetes control and management, the current eBalance Technology has significant potential of success based solely on treating complications caused by diabetes. However, in order to capture a larger market share, the Company is looking into developing more specialized software / treatment options which will allow the Company to continue to grow its market share to allow to sustain the constant revenue streams. The Company anticipates that it will commence development of specialized software to target other ailments such as gout, hypertension, heart disease, neurological disorders, and depression, among others. As at the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not determined the timeframe for rolling out such expansion, however, based on the in-house observations of the effects of the eBalance Therapy on human body, as well as positive response from the Clinical Study subjects, we feel that additional stress on research and fine-tuning of our eBalance devices to treat pain and control blood pressure would become near-term priority.
 
High blood pressure is the number one risk factor for stroke and a major risk factor for developing a heart disease. Pain is perhaps the number one reason people seek professional medical help and take medications; it is what tells the brain that something is wrong and is caused in part by insufficient electrical charge in cells. Since eBalance therapy restores electrical charges to cells it allows for the rapid reduction or elimination of pain from many sources.
 
Empirical Modeling
 
The first-in-human observations took place over many years and were carefully documented. The results of these observations lead to the belief that a specific device with a specific set of bioelectric signals of known waveform, frequency, amplitude, pulse, and duration, accompanied by sensing circuits that respond to fluctuations in the bodys response, in a closed feedback loop, produced cumulative effects that led to remarkable global effects in functional aspects of living in a person who had lived with Type 1 diabetes since age 10. Casual trials in another person with longstanding diabetes, Type 2 in this case, yielded findings of a similar nature in a limited time frame. These observations were followed by broader observational studies by Cell MedXs team.
 
Effects observed in these observational studies include subjective reports of diminished fatigue, improved cognition, diminished neuropathic limb pain, improved sleep, reduction in swelling of extremities, improved skin appearance in color and texture, and a reduction in visual disturbance. Objective measures included healing of wounds, control of blood pressure leading to discontinuation or reduction of medication, and greatly improved control of blood sugars with remarkable diminution in HbA1C (which reflects average blood sugar over months). Remarkably, in the context of Type 1 Diabetes with other potential variables remaining the same, insulin requirements diminished to a considerable degree.
 
Clinical Trials
 
During January through March 2015, we carried out a preliminary Pilot Trial (the Pilot Trial), which was designed to examine the short term metabolic impact of a single treatment with eBalance Technology on two diabetic subjects. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples from each subject were sent for extensive metabolic pathway analysis at the University of Alberta Metabolomics Unit.
 
From those studies we observed alterations in several pathways, which are known to be deficient in persons with diabetes. The results of the Pilot Trial were notable in that significant shifts in metabolites related to blood sugar handling and disposal occurred in a very short time frame, with the only intervening variable being a 10-minute treatment with eBalance Technology.

The findings from the Pilot Trial were then used to inform further experimentation, including selection of metabolic end points for testing during a Phase IB clinical trial, which we started preparations for in July 2015. Due to shortage in available funding, we decided to temporarily postpone the Phase IB clinical Trial.
 
During the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 we engaged Nutrasource Diagnostics Inc. (Nutrasource) to commence observational clinical trial in Canada (Clinical Study) to assess and quantify eBalance technologys ability to alter key metabolic pathways while targeting improved blood sugar control.
 
During our Fiscal 2017, the Company, with the assistance of Nutrasource, secured the main research facility in Hamilton, Ontario, completed and submitted for review by the ethics board the investigational protocol as well as informed consent documentation.
 
Based on finalized investigational protocol the Clinical Study was structured to assess the impact of three months of the eBalance therapy, as an adjunct treatment, on HbA1c in thirty (30) Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics. The secondary endpoints of the Clinical Study were defined to observe changes from baseline and medical history of each Clinical Study subject in the following;
 
·
Insulin sensitivity
·
Diabetic neuropathy
·
Diabetic foot pain and numbness
·
Wound healing
·
Blood pressure
·
Kidney function
·
Any other changes reported by patients

The Company received Health Canadas approval to commence the Clinical Study on January 12, 2017. The approval from the Ethics Review Board was received on January 30, 2017. With all required approvals in place, Dr. Richard Tytus, the Lead Investigator on the Study, and his team at Hamilton Medical Research Group commenced screening for qualified subjects in late February of 2017.
 
In-patient phase of the Clinical Study was completed on July 24, 2017, and a final clinical report was submitted to Health Canada for final approval on January 19, 2018.
 
All 30 subjects (100%) taking part in the Clinical Study followed through to completion. The treatment was considered safe for the purposes of the Clinical Study. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events or negative abnormalities in routine hematology, biochemistry, vital signs or physical findings for the duration of the Trial.
 
The Trial resulted in several encouraging trends spanning a vast array of areas including HbA1c and secondary efficacy endpoints as noted above.
 
Diabetes
 
As mentioned above, the Clinical Study, tested the effectiveness of the eBalance therapy as an adjunct treatment for diabetes and related complications in Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics over three months. The results of the Clinical Study shows that after three months of eBalance treatments, average fasting blood glucose levels declined by 12.3% from 10.5 to 9.2 millimoles per litre. Plasma insulin declined by 46.7% from 168 to 78 picomoles per litre. These results indicate that, on average, the blood glucose uptake was increased and that less insulin was required to achieve that uptake. HbA1c levels declined by 0.16% from 8.36% to 8.20%. A longer double-blind, placebo controlled study may be conducted in the future to determine if the HbA1c levels would be further reduced over a period of time that is longer than the life span of red blood cells.

Blood pressure
 
After seven weeks of treatments, systolic pressure, the higher amount of pressure in the arteries during the contraction of the heart muscle, declined by 9.6% from 142 to 128 millimeters of mercury and stabilized at the lower level through to the end of the Clinical Study. During the same period, diastolic pressure, the pressure in the arteries when the heart muscle is between beats, and which is usually represented by a lower number, declined by 10.4% from 78 to 70 millimeters of mercury and also remained at the lower level. The Company has been encouraged to undertake further studies on subjects with higher blood pressures to determine if a proportional effect is obtained.
 
Pain and numbness
 
Neuropathy is nerve damage that can occur with diabetes as a result of high blood glucose levels and high blood pressure. The damage most often affects the extremities and causes pain, tingling or numbness in the hands, arms, legs and feet. Only two subjects suffered from pain at the beginning of the Clinical Study and both reported feeling either less pain or reduced coldness or numbness in their extremities. These findings support the Companys in-house informal observation and testing results with a number of people who have used eBalance device. Future studies may recruit subjects who are experiencing pain and loss of feeling.
 
Kidney function (Nephropathy)
 
Nephropathy is damage caused to the small blood vessels in the kidneys by high blood glucose levels and high blood pressure that prevents them from functioning properly or even causes them to fail completely. When the blood vessels in the kidneys are injured, the kidneys cannot clean the blood properly. The body will retain more water and salt than it should, which can result in weight gain and edema. The decrease in eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) observed in the Clinical Study and a reduction in edema seen in our informal testing may warrant further investigation to assess the effect of eBalance treatments on kidney function in diabetics.
Product Development
 
On October 1, 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Mr. Claudio Tassi (the Development Agreement) for the development of the first eBalance Professional Series Device (the Prototype). Based on the Development Agreement we agreed to pay Bioformed Aestetic SL (Bio4Med), a company Mr. Tassi is a director of, $12,848 (EURO 12,000) and, upon successful completion of the development of the first eBalance Prototype, issue to Mr. Tassi 100,000 shares of our common stock. We received the first Prototype in November 2015.
 
On December 4, 2015, we executed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med. The LOI contemplated that (i) we will enter into a technology development and license agreements with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med to continue development of therapeutic devices based on the eBalance Technology; (ii) upon approval of the first Prototype, we will place an order for the production of 25 devises; and (iii) Mr. Tassi will provide his services for an initial term of four months commencing on December 4, 2015.
 
On December 15, 2015, as contemplated under the LOI, we ordered the first batch which consisted of 25 eBalance Pro devices with the same configuration as the original Prototype, which were manufactured in early 2016. These devices were designed as a stand-alone unit, controlled by proprietary software installed in an external computer specifically designed to be used with the eBalance device. Once internally tested, the devices were distributed to selected clinics and practitioners as well as used directly by the Company in our in-house observations to see the effects of the eBalance Therapy on the human body.
 
After several months of testing, we received a feedback from the clinicians and participants, which allowed for further refinement of the devices, which were limited to aesthetics and ease of use. The Company ordered from Bio4Med 20 units of the second generation eBalance device, which were received in December 2016. These devices were also distributed to practitioners for observations and further testing.

In early 2017 the management decided to discontinue negotiations with Bio4Med on technology development and license agreements, as contemplated under the LOI, and chose move manufacturing of the eBalance devices to North America. The decision to move to Canada was the outcome of further research we had done on potential markets, tax implications of manufacturing the devices in Europe versus in Canada, cross border transfer pricing, availability of raw material and the control of the production processes. As such, in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2017, we entered into a production agreement with an ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility in Coquitlam, BC, and selected North American suppliers for sourcing essential components.
 
In August of 2017 we entered into negotiations with Brek Technologies Inc. (the Brek), a privately held company, to acquire a microcurrent technology, which compliments the microcurrent technology developed by us for our eBalance Pro devices. The negotiations were finalized on September 7, 2018, by the execution of a intellectual property royalty agreement, whereby we agreed to acquire certain developments and improvements for our eBalance devices developed by Brek in exchange for a perpetual royalty of USD$350 or CAD$350, depending on the currency the revenue is generated in, for each device sold, distributed, or licensed whether through a distributor, sales representative or directly by the Company.
 
On October 16, 2017, we entered into a production development agreement (the Development Agreement) with Western Robotics Ltd. (Western Robotics) with an objective to enhance our eBalance Pro Wellness device based on the new findings that became evident as part of the Clinical Study and the Companys ongoing in-house observations. The Company paid Western Robotics CAD$250,000 for the engineering.
 
During the 3rd quarter of our Fiscal 2019, we completed manufacturing of our first 100 Canadian-built eBalance devices based on the new findings which enhanced our eBalance Devices. Upon receiving our Certificate of Conformity from LabTest Certification Inc., qualifying the eBalance devices as Class A (professional use) and Class B (in-home use), we collaborated with our production facility operated by NDS Electronic Solutions Inc. (NDS) in order to manufacture the eBalance devices. The new Canadian-built eBalance devices were manufactured in accordance with the design specifications and stringent standards imposed by the Company. The eBalance devices were certified to CSA, CE and UL standards for electrical safety and emission standards, and are eligible to bear the LabTest Certification Mark with adjacent indicators C and US.
 
Majority of the eBalance devices manufactured in the third quarter of our Fiscal 2019 were used for further in-house observations as well as for promotional and introductory material.
 
During the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2019, we started a manufacturing process for an additional 60 eBalance devices, which the Company expects to start marketing and selling to its end users represented mostly by local wellness and naturopathic clinics.
 
In order to continue our manufacturing in Canada and move forward with further development and improvements of our devices based on the eBalance Technology, we will require additional capital. We are planning to raise this capital through debt or equity financing or through a combination of both.
 
Medical Device Regulations and Government Approvals
 
The manufacture, packaging, marketing and importing of medical devices is heavily regulated in the United States, Canada and Europe. Further, we expect that any other countries in which we may seek to sell or market devices based on the eBalance Technology will similarly have an extensive regulatory environment.
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, re-label and/or import medical devices sold in the United States. Health Canadas Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate is responsible for regulating the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution and import of medical devices sold in Canada.
 



7



Prior to selling any devices based on the eBalance Technology for the treatment in the United States or Canada, we will be required to make applications to obtain approval from the FDA and Health Canada, respectively. The type of application and complexity of the procedures for obtaining FDA and Health Canada approval will depend upon the classification of the devices that we develop under the provisions of the United States Food and Drugs Act of 1906, as amended, and the Food and Drugs Act (Canada), as amended, respectively, and related regulations.
 
To assist us with the certifications we have engaged services of Mapi Life Sciences Canada an ICON plc company, one of Canadas largest regulatory affairs consulting firms (Mapi). Mapi is working with us on securing our pre-market 510K notification with FDA and Class 2 certification with Health Canada. Due to the globalization of medical device certification standards, the current certification work will also allow the Company to start selling its devices to Brazil, Australia, Japan and Europe.
 
Third Party Payers / Private Insurers
 
Reimbursement for medical devices through Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., and through health protectorates in other nations, is not guaranteed. Third party private payers or private insurers typically follow the lead of government healthcare providers. A decision as to whether a device or treatment is covered involves extensive negotiations and is typically predicated on the concept of health cost savings. If the device can be shown to reduce health care costs through prevention of expensive complications of diabetes, such applications for approvals would be more favorably reviewed.
Marketing Plans
 
Once approved for marketing, we intend to market eBalance devices through authorized dealers and distributors of medical equipment to professional/institutional users. With the limited number of eBalance devices currently being built, the Companys marketing team has established that leasing the devices to various clinics on per-treatment basis would provide the best return on investment, and will allow for the opportunity to collect recurring revenue.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have specified several geographical zones, which we are planning to assign to certain distributors. On September 10, 2018, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent (the LOI) with Live Current Media, Inc. (LIVC), an arms-length party, for worldwide distribution rights to eBalance devices in an end-user market, which was superseded by a definitive exclusive worldwide distribution agreement (the Agreement), dated for reference March 21, 2019.
 
To secure the right to earn the exclusive worldwide distribution rights LIVC paid us a one-time fee of $250,000, pursuant to the LOI. In order to maintain the exclusivity, LIVC must order a minimum of 2,000 devices by the end of a 24-month period from the date the ebalance device receives its 510K clearance from the FDA (the Initial Term). LIVC will be able to order the ebalance devices at a 20% discount to the regular retail price at the time of the order (the License Fee), with 50% of the License Fee payable at the time of placing an order, and remaining 50% payable on the specified delivery date of the devices. During the Initial Term the License Fee for the ebalance devices will be fixed at CAD$2,400 per device.
 
In addition to the License Fee, LIVC will be required to pay a monthly recurring fee per each ebalance device equal to 50% of the regular monthly home-use fee set by the Company. Following the Initial Term, the minimum monthly fee will be $100,000.
 
Competition
 
The current market for treatments that assist in the control and management of diabetes, its complications, as well as other ailments is highly competitive. However, since our eBalance Technology is based on the microcurrent therapy, which is not yet widely accepted in traditional medicine, direct competition for eBalance Technology is not well defined.
 
Indirect competitors include a multitude of pharmaceutical companies that produce various drugs to maintain and prevent diabetes related complications; companies producing glucose monitoring devices, other pharmaceuticals to treat diseases and symptoms.

8



Competitors in electrical therapy include BodiHealth Systems, focusing on pain relief market in US; Electromedical Products International, Inc., the company that developed Alpha-Stim® PPM, which treats and alleviates acute, chronic or postoperative pain using microcurrent therapy, and several other companies currently involved in the microcurrent and electrical current therapies.
 
Patents/Trade Marks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
Our eBalance Technology is not patented. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are in the process of determining the best possible options for securing the proprietary technology represented by the eBalance Technology.
 
To secure the use of the term eBalance during the year ended May 31, 2018, we applied for trademark protection in Canada, the Unites States, Europe and the UK.
 
On September 6, 2018, we entered into an IP Royalty Agreement with an IP Vendor. Pursuant to the IP Royalty Agreement the Company agreed to acquire certain additional developments and improvements for its eBalance devices that were developed by the IP Vendor in exchange for a perpetual royalty of USD$350 or CAD$350, depending on the currency the revenue is generated in, for each device sold, distributed or licensed whether through a distributor, sales representative or by the Company itself.
 
Also on September 6, 2018, we entered into a Royalty Agreement with Mr. Richard Jeffs, our major shareholder. Pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Jeffs, in perpetuity, a 10% royalty on the revenue the Company receives from its distributors or end-users introduced to the Company by Mr. Jeffs.
 
Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees
 
We currently have no employees other than our executive officers, who provide their services as independent consultants. We contract for the services of medical and technical staff we require to administer our observational studies and the clinical trials, as well as other consultants on as needed basis.
