Other Business
 
Greystone processes recycled plastic into pellet form which is used in the manufacturing process of plastic pallets. The pelletized plastic may be sold dependent on Greystone’s ability to produce excess capacity. Greystone may also provide tolling services whereby it grinds and/or pelletizes a customer’s plastic material for a fee.
 
Currently, all of the material that is ground or pelletized is used in-house to satisfy Greystone’s pallet production needs. Accordingly, Greystone has curtailed the sale of pelletized plastic and tolling services to third-party customers pending future changes with respect to internal requirements or an increase in grinding and pelletizing capacity.
 
Pallet Industry
 
Pallets are devices used for moving and storing freight. A pallet is used as a base for assembling, storing, stacking, handling, and transporting goods as a unit load. A pallet is constructed to facilitate the placement of a lift truck’s forks between the levels of a platform so it may be moved easily.
 
Pallets are used worldwide for the transportation of goods and they are primarily made of wood. An estimated 80-90 percent of all U.S. commerce is carried on pallets which amounts to an estimated 1.9 to 2.0 billion pallets in circulation daily in the United States. The manufacture of wood pallets is estimated to consume more than 45 percent of total U.S. hardwood lumber production. “Pallets move the world,” says Dr. Marshall S. “Mark” White, an emeritus professor at Virginia Tech University and director of the William H. Sardo Jr. Pallet and Container Research Laboratory and Center for Packaging and Unit Load Design.
 
The largest industry users of pallets such as the food, chemical, pharmaceutical, beverage and dairy industries are populated with large public or private entities for which profitable financial performance is paramount. The trend for pallets are expected to expand because of overall pallet demand resulting from growth in the U.S. economy and the current U.S. government administration’s efforts to move manufacturing capacity back to the U.S. The operating issues presented by wood pallets have been tolerated to date as there has been no viable alternative in sufficient size for replacement. A report on the market for pallets in North America by Zoe Biller, an industry analyst for Freedonia Group, provided the following on wood and plastic pallets:
 
Wood: Although not highlighted in her report, Biller estimates that about 60% of wooden pallets are used and about 40% are new. Those percentages could shift in favor of new pallets going forward because the industry has been reporting a shortage of quality used pallets, known as cores, for the last year or so. “The core shortage appears to be real and it is going to be part of what’s going on going forward,” Biller said. “But it should correct itself in the long term as end users buy new pallets that replenish the pool.”
 
Nearly two years ago, Costco announced that it was going entirely to a block pallet. Biller believes Costco’s decision is a symptom of the overall trend towards block pallets rather than a driver. “Costco is part of a broader trend towards pallets that are easier to use, especially in an automated system or with pallet jacks,” Biller said. Block pallets fit both of those bills. She adds, “There’s also a bigger trend to turn products and processes that aren’t a core business to a third party and pallet management is definitely part of that trend.”
 
Plastic: The move towards plastic appears to be driven by companies that can control their pallet pools and take advantage of plastics’ longevity as well as “growing sanitation concerns related to wood pallets,” Biller said. “Food safety regulations may have something to do with it going forward.” Asked if she was surprised by any of the results, Biller said she was surprised by how far the pallet market declined during the recession. “A big part of the market advance is the need to bring the number of pallets available for use to required levels,” she said.
 
According to Bob Trebilcock of Modern Materials Handling Magazine, one important bullet point for pallet users from the Freedonia report’s executive summary was that plastic pallets have seen their strongest advances in percentage terms ever and will continue to record above average growth.
 
According to Persistence Market Research, rising demand for alternative pallet types is anticipated to boost the growth of plastic pallets in the global pallets market.

In a June 2017 article, Persistence Market Research published an article that non-wood pallets are likely to experience a massive increase in demand across the globe. Among these, plastic pallets are expected to be the most attractive option. The major reason behind the increase in popularity of and demand for plastic pallets is due to the ease with which these can be cleaned. In addition, they are made of recycled materials. This is a very attractive benefit for companies working towards becoming more environment friendly. This factor is creating a positive impact on the plastic pallets market.
 
Another factor which is driving the growth of plastic pallets is the adoption of pallets by new users. The pallet utilization in various regions across the globe is typically low compared to the size of their manufacturing, warehousing, and construction sectors. However, in the coming years, greater numbers of potential pallet users will strive to become more competitive on a global scale by improving operating efficiencies and reducing product damage in shipments through the use of pallets.
 
The increase in trade volume especially in the Middle East and African regions is also anticipated to fuel the growth of the plastic pallets market. Gulf Cooperation Council countries, located in between the Far East and Europe, can be considered as the gateway to the world’s most progressive markets such as India and China. The transport and logistics sector in the Middle East region is showing substantial growth rates with a long-term positive outlook. The plastic pallets market is thus expected to witness significant growth and is a vital link in supply chain and storage.
 
With a huge incremental opportunity, the global pallets market is projected to grow at more than 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) during the period of assessment.
 
During the period 2012 – 2016, the global pallets market expanded at a CAGR of 4.7%. However, during the forecast period – that is between 2017 and 2025 – the market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 5.4% owing to increasing demand for better and safe transportation coupled with the rise in demand for pallets from various industries like food, agriculture, chemicals etc. The global pallets market is projected to represent incremental opportunity of more than $25 billion between 2017 and 2025.
 
Types of Pallets
 
The most common size pallet is the 48” x 40” 4-way pallet or otherwise referred to as the GMA (Grocery Manufacturer Association) pallet or sometimes known in the industry as the “GMA Pallet,” “The GMA Pallet,” “GMA 48 x 40 Pallet,” or “GMA Block Pallet.” The GMA acts as a commodity in the pallet industry, as price is often determined by availability. As wood pallets move through their life cycle from a new pallet to a used pallet, they are repaired and put back in service until they are sent to a landfill or used as wood compost.
 
Pallets are the primary interface between the packaged product and today’s highly automated material handling equipment. Although pallets are not the most glamorous part of the warehouse, they are important because users have expectations based on specifications and wood pallets lack critical manufacturing details that determine performance. The end user becomes frustrated when these pallets do not perform to expectation. Shipments can be damaged or rejected entirely resulting in significant product and revenue losses. This angst is aggravated when new multi-million-dollar automated systems are in use.
 
Employees
 
As of May 31, 2019, Greystone had 245 full-time employees. A temporary personnel service provides additional production personnel on an as needed basis of which there were 114 production personnel as of May 31, 2019.
Marketing and Customers
 
Greystone’s primary focus is to provide quality plastic pallets to its existing customers while continuing its marketing efforts to broaden its customer base. Greystone’s existing customers are primarily located in the United States and engaged in the beverage, pharmaceutical and other industries. Greystone has generated and plans to continue to generate interest in its pallets by attending trade shows sponsored by industry segments that would benefit from Greystone’s products. Greystone hopes to gain wider product acceptance by marketing the concept that the widespread use of plastic pallets could greatly reduce the destruction of trees on a worldwide basis. Greystone sells to customers through contract distributors or by direct contract through its President and other employees.

Greystone derives a substantial portion of its revenue from three customers. These customers accounted for approximately 86% and 78% of total sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Greystone’s recycled plastic pallets are designed to meet the respective customer’s needs and are the only pallets approved for use by these customers. There is no assurance that Greystone will retain these customers’ business at the same level, or at all. The loss of a material amount of business from these customers could have a material adverse effect on Greystone.
 
Competition
 
Greystone’s primary competitors are a large number of small, privately held firms that sell wood pallets in very limited geographic locations. Greystone believes that it can compete with manufacturers of wood pallets by emphasizing the cost savings realized over the longer life of its plastic pallets as well as the environmental benefits (principally elimination from landfill and recycling) of its plastic pallets as compared to wood pallets. Greystone also competes with three large and approximately ten small manufacturers of plastic pallets. Some of Greystone’s competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources than Greystone and, therefore, may be able to commit greater resources than Greystone in such areas of product development, manufacturing and marketing. However, Greystone believes that its proprietary designs coupled with the competitive pricing of its products gives Greystone an advantage over other plastic pallet manufacturers.
Government Regulation
 
Although Greystone recycles approximately 41,000 tons of post-consumer plastic per year which would otherwise be destined for the landfill, business operations of Greystone are subject to existing and potential federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. In addition, both the plastics industry and Greystone are subject to existing and potential federal, state, local and foreign legislation designed to reduce solid wastes by requiring, among other things, plastics to be degradable in landfills, minimum levels of recycled content, various recycling requirements, disposal fees and limits on the use of plastic products.
Patents and Trademarks
 
Greystone seeks to protect its technical advances by pursuing national and international patent protection for its products and methods when appropriate.
 
Management Plastic Pallet Summation
 
During the past two decades both timber prices and landfill fees have increased and have compelled businesses to modify the way pallets are managed. Businesses can evaluate and improve their pallet management systems and reduce associated waste by utilizing recycled plastic pallets.
 
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, deforestation is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide gas emissions. Deforestation leads to CO2 emissions because the carbon sequestered in trees is emitted into the atmosphere and not counter-balanced by re-growth of new trees. Additionally, estimates are that up to 20 percent of total pallet wood waste ends up in land fill.
 
Greystone’s management believes that the gradual shifting trend from wood to 100 percent recyclable plastic pallets will continue, with the primary limiting factors being a front-end higher price and some regulatory limits to certain applications of pallet use. The savings come in the recyclability and significantly longer life which lowers the cost per trip dramatically. Greystone intends to continue to conduct research on pallet design for strength and coefficient of friction, on the materials used to make the plastic pallets as required to meet market demands and to improve its existing products. Plastic pallets reduce wood waste, are hygienic, weigh less which lowers fuel consumption and transport costs and are fully recyclable.
 
The principal raw materials used in manufacturing Greystone’s plastic pallets are in abundant supply. At the present time, these materials are being purchased from local, national and international suppliers.
