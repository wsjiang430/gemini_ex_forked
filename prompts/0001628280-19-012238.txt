Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
USA Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”, “We”, “USAT”, or “Our”) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in January 1992. We are a provider of technology-enabled solutions, including wireless networking, cashless transactions, asset monitoring and other value-added services that facilitate electronic payment transactions primarily within the unattended point of sale (“POS”) market. We are a leading provider in the small ticket beverage and food vending industry in the United States and are expanding our solutions and services in other unattended market segments, such as amusement, commercial laundry, air/vac, car wash, kiosk and others. Since our founding, we have designed and marketed systems, devices and solutions that facilitate electronic payment options, as well as telemetry and services facilitated by the Internet of Things (“IoT”), which include the ability to remotely monitor, control, and report on the health and performance of distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions. Historically, these distributed assets have relied on cash for payment in the form of coins or bills, whereas, our systems allow them to accept cashless payments such as through the use of credit or debit cards or other emerging contactless forms, such as mobile payment.
On November 9, 2017, we acquired Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. (“Cantaloupe”), a premier provider of cloud and mobile solutions for the self-service retail market, in a transaction valued at approximately $88 million, consisting of $65 million in cash and $23 million in shares of our common stock. The acquisition expanded our existing cashless payment and asset monitoring platform to an end-to-end logistics and enterprise platform by integrating Cantaloupe’s Seed software services, which provide advanced operational analytics, dynamic route scheduling, automated pre-kitting, proactive malfunction management, responsive merchandising, inventory management, warehouse purchasing and accounting management. We believe that the services we obtained as a result of the acquisition are highly complementary, value-added cloud-based and mobile services, which we are now cross-selling to our existing customer base. As a result of the Cantaloupe acquisition, we acquired approximately 1,400 new customers and 270,000 new connections to our service.
We derive the majority of our revenues from license and transaction fees resulting from connections to, as well as services provided by, our ePort Connect service. These services include cashless payment, loyalty, inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, and responsive merchandising. Connections to the Company’s service include those resulting from the sale or lease of our POS electronic payment devices, telemetry devices or certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals or telemetry devices. The majority of ePort Connect customers pay a monthly fee plus a blended transaction rate on the transaction dollar volume processed by the Company. Connections to the ePort Connect service, therefore, are the most significant driver of the Company’s revenues, particularly revenues from license and transaction fees.
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had approximately 1,169,000 connections to its ePort Connect and Seed services, compared to approximately 1,028,000 connections to the ePort Connect service as of June 30, 2018, representing a 14% increase. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company processed approximately 847.2 million cashless transactions totaling approximately $1.6 billion in transaction dollars, representing a 35% increase in transaction volume and a 38% increase in dollars processed from the 627.2 million cashless transactions totaling approximately $1.2 billion during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.
The Company counts a telemeter and/or cashless payment device (for example, an ePort cashless payment device or Seed telemeter) as a connection upon shipment of an activated device to a customer under contract, at which time the device is capable of transmitting cashless payment and other data to USALive, the Company’s online reporting platform, or utilizing the Seed management services.
The Company counts a self-service retail location that does not utilize our telemeter and/or cashless payment device as a connection upon (i) receipt of notice from a customer under contract of a location that has been enabled with our API software, and (ii) our subsequent activation of the location on our platform which enables the location to utilize our payment transaction and logistics management services.
A connection to our device does not necessarily mean that our telemeter or cashless payment device has already been installed by the customer at a location, or has begun accepting and transmitting payment transactions, or has actually begun utilizing management services, or that the Company has begun receiving monthly service fees in connection with the device. Likewise, a non-device connection does not necessarily mean that the location has begun transmitting payment transactions, or has actually begun utilizing 
6

the management services, or that the Company has begun receiving monthly service fees. Rather, at the time of shipment of the device or the activation of the non-device location on our platform, the customer becomes obligated to pay the one-time activation fee (if applicable), and is obligated to pay monthly service fees and lease payments (if applicable) in accordance with the terms of the customer’s contract with the Company.
A self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one connection.
Our customer contracts provide that the customer may deactivate a device or a non-device location, as the case may be, from our platform by prior notice to us (generally thirty to sixty days). We will no longer count an existing connection as a connection following the receipt of instructions from the customer to deactivate the device or non-device location, as the case may be, upon the expiration of the applicable notice period, provided that the notice is in accordance with the terms of the customer contract. A previously installed telemeter or cashless payment system that is no longer being utilized by our customer is considered and reported as an existing connection unless and until the customer provides the appropriate notice under the contract and the applicable notice period has expired.

The above charts show the increases over the last five fiscal years in the number of connections, revenues and the dollar value of transactions handled by us. The vertical bars depict total revenues, segmented by license and transaction and Seed services fees and equipment revenues. The solid lines depict the number of connections to our ePort Connect and Seed services and the dollar value of transactions handled by us, as of the end of each of the last five fiscal years.
Our cashless solutions and services have been designed to simplify the transition to cashless for traditionally cash-only based businesses. As such, they are turn-key and include our comprehensive ePort Connect service and POS electronic payment devices or certified payment software, which are able to process traditional magnetic stripe credit and debit cards, contactless credit and debit cards and mobile payments. Standard services through ePort Connect are maintained on our proprietary operating systems and include merchant account setup on behalf of the customer, automatic processing and settlement, sales reporting and 24x7 customer support. Other value-added services that customers can choose from include cashless deployment planning, cashless performance review, loyalty products and services, and vending management solutions. Our solutions also provide flexibility to execute a variety of payment applications on a single system, transaction security, connectivity options, compliance with certification standards, and centralized, accurate, real-time sales and inventory data to manage distributed assets (wireless telemetry and IoT). The ePort® Interactive, which was unveiled in April 2016, is a cloud-based interactive media and content delivery management system and enables delivery of nutritional information, remote refunds, loyalty programs, and multimedia-marketing campaigns for the unattended and self-serve retail markets. Our Seed services complement our cashless services and provide customers with advanced operational analytics, dynamic route scheduling, automated pre-kitting, proactive equipment malfunction management, responsive merchandising, inventory management, warehouse purchasing, and accounting management.
Our customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate primarily in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets including beverage and food vending, amusement and arcade machines, smartphones via our ePort Online solution, commercial laundry, and various other self-serve kiosk applications as well as equipment developers or manufacturers who incorporate our ePort Connect service into their product offerings.
We believe that we have a history of being a market leader in cashless payments with a recognized brand name, a value-added proposition for our customers and a reputation of innovation in our products and services. We believe that these attributes position us to capitalize on industry trends.
In January 2016, the Company acquired the cloud-based content delivery platform, device platform and products, customer base, and intellectual property of VendScreen, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. In addition to new technology and services, this acquisition, in addition to the acquisition of Cantaloupe in November 2017, has added an extended operational footprint for the Company, providing greater efficiencies in operational performance, expanded customer services, sales and technical support to the Company’s customer base. As a result of the acquisition, the Company added to its product line an interactive media, content delivery system, including a vending application that provides consumer product information, including nutritional data. The technology is NFC-enabled and compatible with mobile wallets including Apple Pay and Google Pay, and supports instant refunds, couponing, advertising and real-time consumer feedback to the owner and operator.
THE INDUSTRY
We operate primarily in the small ticket electronic payments and vending management industry and, more specifically, the broad unattended POS market. We provide our customers the ability to accept cashless payment “on the go” through mobile-based payment services. Our solutions and services facilitate electronic payments in industries that have traditionally relied on cash transactions and simplify inventory, warehouse, logistics, and accounting management. We believe the following industry trends are driving growth in demand for electronic payment systems and advanced logistics management in general and more specifically within the markets we serve:

• | Ongoing shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks;


• | Increasing demand for electronic transaction functionality from both consumers and merchant/operators;


• | Improving POS technology and NFC equipped mobile phone payment technology; and


• | Increasing demand for business efficiency through modern, cloud based logistics and inventory management systems.

Shift toward electronic payment transactions and away from cash and checks
There has been an ongoing shift away from paper-based methods of payment, including cash and checks, towards electronic-based methods of payment. According to The Nilson Report, August 2018, during 2017, three card-based systems-credit, debit, and 
8

prepaid global general-purpose cards from U.S. issuers-generated $5.55 trillion in purchase volume for goods and services, and purchases on commercial cards increased 8.8%. Consumer card purchase volume was up 7.7%. Employees of private companies, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations using credit and debit cards, as well as consumers using various prepaid products (payroll, government benefits, insurance payouts, disaster relief, and more) generated $1.242 trillion in commercial card purchase volume. This was 22.37% of combined commercial and consumer card purchase volume in 2017. That market share was an increase from 22.19% in 2016.
Increase in Consumer and Merchant/Operator Demand for Electronic Payments
Increase in Consumer Demand. The unattended, vending and kiosk POS market has historically been dominated by cash purchases. However, oftentimes, where purchases can only be made by cash at unattended POS locations, the requirement represents a cumbersome transaction for the consumer because they do not have the correct monetary value (paper or coin), or the consumer does not have the ability to convert their bills into coins. We believe electronic payment system providers such as the Company that can meet consumers’ demand within the unattended market will be able to offer retailers, card associations, card issuers and payment processors and business owners an expanding value proposition at the POS. Based upon our survey of selected vending machines connected to our service, we estimate that average annual cashless sales per machine increased by approximately 53% over the first twelve months following cashless deployment, and cashless sales as a percentage of total machine sales (cashless and cash) increased by 16% from those of such prior twelve-month period. In addition, average consumer purchases during the recent twelve-month period in which the consumer utilized a credit or debit card were approximately 38% higher than purchases where the consumer utilized cash.
Increase in Merchant/Operator Demand, for Electronic Payments. We believe that, increasingly, merchants and operators of unattended payment locations (e.g., vending machines, laundry, tabletop games, etc.) are utilizing electronic payment alternatives as a means to improve business results. The Company works with its customers to help them drive increased revenue of their distributed assets through this expanded market opportunity. In addition, electronic payment systems can provide merchants and operators real-time sales and inventory data utilized for back-office reporting and forecasting, like the Company’s Seed solutions and services, helping them to manage their business more efficiently.
Increase in Demand for Integrated Payment Solutions. We believe that merchants have come to value payment solutions that are integrated or bundled with other solutions and software. Offering an integrated solution allows us to provide a single-source solution for our customers, and results in better customer retention and a better overall experience for our customers. Our recent acquisition of Cantaloupe allows us to provide an end-to-end enterprise solution to our customers, which includes advanced operational analytics, dynamic route scheduling, automated pre-kitting, proactive equipment malfunction management, responsive merchandising, inventory management, warehouse purchasing, and accounting management. We also view our integrated solutions as a significant competitive advantage as competitors will need fully integrated solutions to compete.
Increase in Demand for Networked Assets. IoT technology includes capturing value from wireless modules and electronic devices to improve business productivity and customer service. In addition, networked assets can provide valuable information regarding consumers’ purchasing patterns and payment preferences, allowing operators to more effectively tailor their offerings to consumers. In February 2017, Gartner, Inc. forecasted that worldwide connected things would reach 20.4 billion by 2020. 
POS Technology and NFC Equipped Mobile Phone Payment Improvements
Near Field Communication (“NFC”) is a short range wireless connectivity technology that uses electromagnetic radio fields to enable communication between devices when there is a physical touch, or when they are within close proximity to one another. We believe that POS contactless terminals that are enabled to accept NFC payments and digital wallet applications, such as Google Wallet, Chase Pay, Apple Pay, Android Pay, and others, stand to benefit from these evolving trends in mobile payment. Digital wallet is essentially a digital service, accessed via the web or a mobile phone application that serves as a substitute for the traditional credit or debit card. Providers can also market directly to targeted consumers with coupons and loyalty programs.
As approximately 792,000 of the Company’s connections are contactless enabled to accept NFC payments (in addition to magnetic stripe cards) as of June 30, 2019, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from this emerging space.
OUR TECHNOLOGY-BASED SOLUTION
Our solutions are designed to be turn-key and include the ePort Connect service, which is a cashless payment gateway, the Seed services, which provide customers with inventory management, logistics, warehouse and accounting management, and responsive merchandising solutions. Our POS electronic payment devices contain certified payment software which is able to process traditional magnetic stripe as well as contactless credit and debit cards and NFC-equipped mobile phones that allow consumers 
9

to make payments with their cell phones. We believe that our ability to bundle our products and services, as well as the ability to tailor and customize them to individual customer needs, makes it easy and efficient for our customers to adopt and deploy our technology, and results in a service unmatched in the small-ticket, unattended retail market today.
The Product. The Company offers its customers several different devices or software to connect and manage their distributed assets. These range from our QuickConnect™ Web service, more fully described below under the section “OUR PRODUCTS,” and encrypted magnetic stripe card readers to our ePort® hardware that can be attached to the door of a stand-alone terminal.
The Network. Our ePort Connect services network is designed to transmit from our customers’ terminals payment information for processing and sales and diagnostic data for storage and reporting to our customers. Also, the network, through server-based software applications, provides remote management information, and enables control of the networked device’s functionality. Through our network we have the ability to upload software and update devices remotely enabling us to manage the devices easily and efficiently (e.g., change protocol functionality, provide software upgrades, and change terminal display messages).
The Connectivity Mediums. The client devices (described below) are interconnected for the transfer of our customers’ data through our ePort Connect network that provides wireless-based connectivity. Increased wireless connectivity options, coverage and reliability have allowed us to service a greater number of geographically dispersed customer locations. Additionally, we make it easy for our customers to deploy wireless solutions by acting as a single point of contact. We have contracted with Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility in order to supply our customers with wireless network coverage.
Data Security. We are listed on the VISA Global Registry of Service Providers, meaning that VISA has reviewed and accepted the Report on Compliance (RoC) from our authorized Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) assessor as a PCI DSS Service Provider. Our entry on this registry is renewed annually, and our current entry is valid through December 31, 2019. The VISA listing can be found online at http://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do.
OUR SERVICES
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, license and transaction fees generated by our ePort Connect and Seed services represented 86% of the Company’s revenues, compared to 73% of the Company’s revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. Our ePort Connect solution provides customers with all of the following services, under one cohesive service umbrella:

• | Diverse POS options. Ability to connect to a broad product line of cashless acceptance devices or software.


• | Card Processing Services. Through our existing relationships with card processors and card associations, we provide merchant account and terminal ID set up, pre-negotiated discounted fees on small ticket purchases, and direct electronic funds transfers (EFTs) to our customers’ bank accounts for all settled card transactions as well as ensure compliance with current processing guidelines.


• | Wireless Connectivity. We manage wireless account activations, distributions, and relationships with wireless providers for our customers, if needed.


• | Customer/Consumer Services. We support our installed base by providing 24‑hour help desk support, repairs, and replacement of impaired system solutions. In addition, all inbound consumer billing inquiries are handled through a 24‑hour help desk, thereby eliminating the need for our customers to deal with consumer billing inquiries and potential chargebacks.


• | Online Sales Reporting. Via the USALive online reporting system, we provide customers with a host of sales and operational data, including information regarding their credit and cash transactions, user configuration, reporting by machine and region, by date range and transaction type, data reports for operations and finance, graphical reporting of sales, and condition monitoring for equipment service, as well as activation of new devices and redeployments.


• | IoT Telemetry and DEX data transfer. DEX, an acronym for digital exchange, is the vending industry’s standard way to communicate information such as sales, cash in bill-validators, coins in coin-boxes, sales of units by selection, pricing, door openings, and much more. The Company is able to remotely transfer and push DEX data to customers’ route management systems through DEX. The Company operates within the VDI (Vending Data Interchange) standards established by NAMA (National Automatic Merchandising Association) and sends DEX files compatible with most major remote management software systems.

In connection with providing cashless payment services which we have historically provided to our customers, we enter into an ePort Connect Services Agreement, our processing and licensing agreement, with the customer pursuant to which we act as a provider of cashless financial services for the customer’s distributed assets, and the customer agrees to have us retain from settled funds an activation fee, monthly service fees, and transaction processing fees. Our agreements are generally cancelable by the customer upon thirty to sixty days’ notice to us. It typically takes thirty to sixty days for a new connection to begin contributing to the Company’s license and transaction fee revenues.
In connection with providing Seed vending management solutions, with or without Seed cashless financial services, we enter into Subscription Agreements with our customers. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement and the related Master Service Agreement, the customer typically assumes a non-cancellable obligation to receive and pay for our services for a period of five years. For some of these customers, we serve as the merchant of record, and the customer agrees to have fees for both cashless and vending management services withheld from the settled funds. For the remainder of the customers, Global Payments, Inc., formerly Heartland Payment Systems, Inc., serves as the merchant of record, and we bill the customers for our vending management solutions.
OUR PRODUCTS
ePort is the Company’s core device, which is currently being utilized in self-service, unattended markets such as vending, amusement and arcade, and various other kiosk applications. Our ePort product facilitates cashless payments by capturing payment information and transmitting it to our network for authorization with the payment system (e.g., credit card processors). Additional capabilities of our ePort consist of control/access management by authorized users, collection of audit information (e.g., date and time of sale and sales amount), diagnostic information of the host equipment, and transmission of this data back to our network for web-based reporting, or to a compatible remote management system.

SPECIFIC MARKETS WE SERVE
Our current customers are primarily in the self-serve, small ticket retail markets in North America, including beverage and food vending and kiosk, commercial laundry, car wash, tolls, amusement and gaming, and office coffee. We estimate that there are approximately 13 million to 15 million potential connections in this self-serve, small ticket retail market. The 1,169,000 connections to our service as of June 30, 2019 constitute 8% of these potential connections, compared to 1,028,000 connections to our service as of June 30, 2018, which constituted 7% of these potential connections. While these industry sectors represent only a small fraction of our total market potential, as described below, these are the areas where we have gained the most traction to date. In addition to being our current primary markets, we believe these sectors serve as a proof-of-concept for other unattended POS industry applications.
Vending. According to the 2018 Census of the Convenience Services Industry conducted by Technomic for NAMA, the convenience services industry, which consists of vending machines, micro markets, office coffee service (OCS) and pantry services, is estimated to represent a total annual revenue of $26 billion, a 4% increase since 2016. The Census found that while the vending segment of the convenience services industry continued to contract (-3% since 2016), micro markets, OCS and pantry service segments have more than made up for the shortfall. According to the Census, micro markets continued their rapid expansion, with revenues growing 99% over the previous two years, while OCS grew at 7%. The Company believes these machines represent a significant market opportunity for electronic payment conversion when compared to the Company’s existing ePort Connect service base and the overall low rate of industry adoption to date. For example, in another study conducted by Automatic Merchandiser (State of the Vending Industry, June 2015) that included a representative 5.1 million machines, cashless adoption was estimated at only 11% in 2014. With the continued shift to electronic payments and the advancement in mobile and POS technology, we believe that the traditional beverage and food vending industry will continue to look to cashless payments and telemetry systems to improve their business results.
Kiosk. The second annual Kiosk Market Census Report found that sales of global interactive kiosks - not counting vending machines, ATMs and mounted tablets - reached $9.2 billion in 2019, marking an 18 percent 1-year gain and surpassing the prior year's growth rate. We believe that kiosks are becoming increasingly popular as credit, debit or contactless payment options enable kiosks to sell an increased variety of items. In addition, the study points to the increasing trend toward self-sufficiency, where time is the most important commodity of the consumer. As merchants continue to seek new ways to reach their customers through kiosk applications, we believe the need for a reliable cashless payment provider experienced with machine integration, PCI compliance and cashless payment services designed specifically for the unattended market will be of increasing value in this market. Our 
12

existing kiosk customers integrate with our cashless payment services via our QuickConnect Web service using one of our encrypted readers or ePort POS technologies.
Laundry. Our primary targets in laundry consist of the coin-operated commercial laundry and multi-housing laundry markets. According to the Coin Laundry Association, the U.S. commercial laundry industry is comprised of about 29,500 coin laundries in the U.S., with an estimated gross annual revenue of nearly $5 billion.
OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS
We believe that we benefit from a number of advantages gained through our nearly twenty-five year history in our industry. They include:

1. | One-Stop Shop, End-to-End Solution. We believe that our ability to offer our customers one point of contact through a bundled cashless payment solution makes it easy and efficient for our customers to adopt and deploy our electronic payment solutions and results in a service that is unmatched in the small ticket, self-service retail market today. To our knowledge, other cashless payment and vending management solutions available in the market today require the operator to set up their own accounts for cashless processing (i.e., act as the merchant of record) and manage multiple service providers (i.e., hardware terminal manufacturer, wireless network provider, and/or credit card processor). We interface directly with our card processor and wireless service provider, and, with our hardware solutions, are able to offer a bundled and integrated solution to our customers for whom we serve as the merchant of record.


2. | Trusted Brand Name. We believe that the ePort has a strong national reputation for quality, reliability, and innovation. We believe that card associations, payment processors, and merchants/operators trust our system solutions and services to handle financial transactions in a secure operating environment. Our trusted brand name is exemplified by our high level of customer retention and numerous exclusive three-year agreements with customers for use of our ePort Connect service. We have agreements with partners like Visa, MasterCard, Chase Paymentech and Verizon Wireless as well as several one-way exclusive relationships which we have solidified with leading organizations within the unattended POS industry, including Setomatic Systems and AMI Entertainment Network, Inc.


3. | Market Leadership. We believe we have one of the largest installed bases of unattended POS electronic payment systems in the unattended small ticket retail market for food and beverage in the United States and we are continuing to expand to other adjacent markets such as laundry, amusement, gaming, and kiosks. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 1,169,000 connections to our network. Our installed base supports our sales and marketing initiatives by enhancing our ability to establish or expand our market position. In addition, this data in combination with our industry experts and analysis enables us to offer Premium Services to our customers to help them deploy and better leverage our technology in their locations. We believe our installed base also provides multiple opportunities for referrals for new business, either from the merchant or operator of the deployed asset or through one of our several strategic partnerships.


4. | Attractive Value Proposition for Our Customers. We believe that our solutions provide our customers an attractive value proposition. Our solutions and services make possible increased purchases by consumers who in the past were limited to the physical cash on hand while making a purchase at an unattended terminal, thereby increasing the universe of potential customers and the size of the purchases of those customers. In addition, we offer value-added offerings and services such as Two-Tier Pricing, which allows the operator to charge different amounts for the same product depending upon whether the consumer chooses to pay by cash or credit/debit. Consumer engagement services further extend the potential for customers to build new revenue opportunities, customer loyalty and brand distinction. One of such services is provided through the ePort interactive platform, our cloud-based interactive media and content delivery management system, which enables delivery of nutritional information, remote refunds, loyalty programs, and multimedia-marketing campaigns for the unattended and self-serve retail markets. Lastly, with our new Seed Cloud, we provide the ability for customers to pursue additional opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies with tools such as advanced operational analytics, dynamic route scheduling, automated pre-kitting, proactive equipment malfunction management, responsive merchandising, inventory management, warehouse purchasing, and accounting management on a modern, cloud based SaaS offering.


5. | Increasing Scale and Financial Stability. Due to the continued growth in connections to the Company’s ePort Connect and Seed services, during the 2019 fiscal year, 86% of the Company’s revenues were from license and transaction fees which are recurring in nature, compared to 73% of the Company's revenues during the 2018 fiscal year. We believe that this growing scale provides us improved financial stability and the footprint to market and distribute our products and services more effectively and in more markets than most of our competitors.


6. | Customer-Focused Research and Development. Our research and development initiatives focus primarily on adding features and functionality to our electronic payment solutions and logistics management platform based on customer input and emerging

13

market trends. As of June 30, 2019, we had 87 patents (US and International) in force, and 7 United States and 7 international patent applications pending. We have generated considerable intellectual property and know-how associated with creating a seamless, end-to-end experience for our customers.
OUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our primary objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of technology that enables electronic payment transactions, advanced logistics management, and value-added services primarily at small-ticket, self-service retail locations such as vending, kiosks, commercial laundry, and other similar markets. We plan to execute our growth strategy organically and through strategic acquisitions. The Company believes its service-approach business model can create a high-margin stream of recurring revenues that could create a foundation for long-term value and continued growth. Key elements of our strategy are to:
Drive Growth in Connections
Leverage Existing Customers/Partners. We have a solid base of key customers across multiple markets, particularly in vending, that have currently deployed our solutions and services to a portion of their deployed base. Approximately 86% of our new connections during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 and approximately 75% of our new connections during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were from existing customers. We estimate that our current customers represent approximately 3,100,000 potential connections. Based on the 1,169,000 connections to our service as of June 30, 2019, there remain approximately 1,900,000 million potential connections from our current customers that could be connected to our service. As a result, they are a key component of our plan to drive future sales. We have worked to build these relationships, drive future deployments, and develop customized network interfaces. Our customers have seen the benefits of our products and services first-hand and we believe they currently represent the largest opportunity to scale connections to our service.
Expand Distribution and Sales Reach. We are intently focused on driving profitable growth through efficient sales channels. Our sales resources and new distribution relationships have led to increased penetration in markets such as amusement and arcade, and commercial laundry. When a reseller sells our ePort, we count a customer as a new customer upon the signing of the applicable services agreement with the customer.
Further Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We plan to continue to introduce our turn-key solutions and services to various adjacent markets such as the broad-based kiosk market and other similar markets by leveraging our expertise in cashless payment integration combined with the capacity and uniqueness of our ePort Connect solution.
Capitalize on Opportunities in International Markets. We are currently focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets for our ePort devices and related ePort Connect service but may seek to establish a presence in electronic payment markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In order to do so, however, we would have to invest in additional sales and marketing and research and development resources targeted towards these regions. At this time, the Company believes the most efficient route to these markets will be achieved by optimizing and coordinating opportunities with its global partners and customers.
Expanding the Value of our Service
Capitalize on the emerging NFC and growing mobile payments trends. With approximately 91% of our cashless connected base enabled to accept NFC payments (including mobile wallets), the Company believes that continued increases in consumer preferences towards contactless payments, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay, represent a significant opportunity for the Company to further drive adoption. As the variety of payment methods expands and consumer behaviors evolve, the ability to make credit and debit card payments at unattended terminals is highly in demand among consumers, with 70% of U.S., U.K. and Australian respondents in the 2018 TNS Unattended Terminals Survey saying they would prefer unattended vending machines and kiosks to accept both card and cash payments. This same survey found that 57% of adults between the ages of 18 and 34 were willing to make a payment at an unattended terminal with a digital wallet such as Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Google Pay. Further, 33% of the U.S. respondents said they would be willing to make a payment at an unattended kiosk or vending machine using a wearable device, such as a bracelet, fitness tracker, keyring, etc. As consumers continue to adopt these new methods of cashless payments, it is our belief that adoption will continue to accelerate at a rapid pace and result in more rapid adoption of cashless solutions like the Company’s ePort in the markets that we serve.
Continuous Innovation. We are continuously enhancing our solutions and services in order to satisfy our customers and the end-consumers relying on our products at the POS locations. Our product innovation team is always working to enhance the design, size, and speed of data transmission, as well as security and compatibility with other electronic payment solution providers’ technologies. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of USAT’s solutions and services in the unattended POS payments market.

In addition to its industry-leading ePort cashless payments system, the Company seeks to provide its customers with a comprehensive, value-added ePort Connect service that is designed to encourage optimal return on investment through business planning and performance optimization; business metrics through the Company’s KnowledgeBase of data; a loyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; marketing strategy and executional support; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend cashless payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operator’s business including micro-markets contract food industry, online payments and mobile payments.
Leverage Intellectual Property. Through June 30, 2019, we have 87 U.S. and foreign patents in force that contain various claims, including claims relating to payment processing, networking and energy management devices. In addition, we own numerous trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. We will continue to explore ways to leverage this intellectual property in order to add value for our customers, attain an increased share of the market, and generate licensing revenues.
SALES AND MARKETING
The Company’s sales strategy includes both direct sales and channel development, depending on the particular dynamics of each of our markets. Our marketing strategy is diversified and includes media relations, direct mail, digital automation, conferences, and client referrals. As of June 30, 2019, the Company was marketing and selling its products through its full and part-time sales staff consisting of 26 people.
Direct Sales
Our direct sales efforts are currently primarily focused on the beverage and food vending industry in the United States, although we continue to further develop our presence in our ancillary market segments.
Indirect Sales/ Distribution
As part of our strategy to expand our sales reach while optimizing resources, we have agreements with select resellers in the car wash, amusement and arcade, and vending markets. We also have a strategic marketing relationship in the commercial laundry market that makes the Company the exclusive service provider to Setomatic Systems’ POS offering, SpyderWash. We also have a distribution and white label program with the Wittern Group, a manufacturer of vending machines, pursuant to which Wittern embeds our Seed cashless hardware into its vending machines and sells Seed services to its customers. We have also entered into agreements with resellers and distributors in connection with our energy management products.

IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS
Verizon Wireless
In April 2011, we signed an agreement with Verizon for access to their digital wireless wide area network for the transport of data, including credit card transactions and inventory management data. The initial term of the agreement was three years, which was extended until April 2016. Since the end of the term, the agreement automatically renewed and will continue to automatically renew for successive one month periods unless terminated by either party upon thirty days’ notice.
On September 21, 2011, the Company and Verizon entered into a Joint Marketing Addendum (the “Verizon Agreement”) which amended the agreement described above. Pursuant to the Verizon Agreement, the Company and Verizon would work together to help identify business opportunities for the Company’s products and services. Verizon may introduce the Company to existing or potential Verizon customers that Verizon believes are potential purchasers of the Company’s products or services and may attend sales calls with the Company made to these customers. The Company and Verizon would collaborate on marketing and communications materials that would be used by each of them to educate and inform customers regarding their joint marketing 
15

work. Verizon has the right to list the Company’s products and services in its Data Solutions Guide for use by its sales and marketing employees and in its external website. The Verizon Marketing Agreement is terminable by either party upon 45 days’ notice.
VISA
As of July 1, 2017, we entered into a three-year agreement with Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa”), pursuant to which Visa has agreed to continue to make available to the Company certain promotional interchange reimbursement fees for small ticket debit and credit card transactions in the unattended beverage and food vending merchant category code, as well as for small ticket regulated debit card transactions in the other unattended vending and/or retail merchant category codes covered by the agreement.

MasterCard
On January 12, 2015, we entered into a three-year MasterCard Acceptance Agreement (“MasterCard Agreement”) with MasterCard International Incorporated ("MasterCard"), pursuant to which MasterCard has agreed to make available to us reduced interchange rates for small ticket debit card transactions in certain merchant category codes. As previously reported, MasterCard had significantly increased its interchange rates for small ticket regulated debit card transactions effective October 1, 2011, and as a result, the Company ceased accepting MasterCard debit card products in mid-November 2011. Pursuant to the MasterCard Agreement, however, the Company is currently accepting MasterCard debit card products for small ticket debit card transactions in the unattended beverage and food vending merchant category code. The Company and MasterCard entered into a first amendment on April 27, 2015, pursuant to which the conditions under, or the transactions to, which the MasterCard custom pricing would be available, was amended. The reduced interchange rates became effective on April 20, 2015. Pursuant to an amendment effective July 17, 2018, the agreement was extended until March 1, 2019, and will automatically renew for successive one-year terms thereafter, unless either party provides 60 days’ advance notice of non-renewal.
Chase Paymentech
We entered into a five-year Third Party Payment Processor Agreement, dated April 24, 2015 with Paymentech, LLC, through its member, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Chase Paymentech”), pursuant to which Chase Paymentech will act as the provider of credit and debit card transaction processing services (including authorization, conveyance and settlement of transactions) to the Company, which acts as the merchant of record.

Compass/Foodbuy
On June 30, 2009, we entered into a Master Purchase Agreement (“MPA”) with Foodbuy, LLC (“Foodbuy”), the procurement company for Compass Group USA, Inc. (“Compass”) and other customers. The MPA provides, among other things that, USAT shall be a preferred supplier and provider to Foodbuy and its customers, including Compass, of USAT’s products and services. The MPA automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless terminated by either party upon sixty days’ notice prior to the end of any such one-year renewal period. In addition, on July 1, 2009, USAT and Compass, in conjunction with the MPA described above, also entered into a three-year ePort Connect Services Agreement pursuant to which USAT will provide Compass with all card processing, data, network, communications and financial services, and DEX telemetry data services required in connection with all Compass vending machines utilizing ePorts.

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, Compass represented approximately 17% and 16% of our total revenues, respectively. Our Seed Pro software is utilized by vending machines operated by Compass for dynamic scheduling, pre-kitting, asset health management, and merchandising to Compass’s customers nationwide.
AMI Entertainment
On August 22, 2011, we entered into an exclusive three-year agreement with AMI Entertainment (“AMI”) as their exclusive processor of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments in connection with equipment operated on AMI’s network in 
16

the U.S. and Canada. The agreement is subject to renewal for one-year periods thereafter, subject to notice of non-renewal by either party. AMI manufactures various types of amusement, entertainment and music equipment for sale to third party users.
Setomatic Systems
In April 2013, we entered into a three-year exclusive agreement with Setomatic Systems (“Setomatic”), a privately owned and operated developer and manufacturer of both open and closed loop card payment systems, drop coin meters and electronic timers for the commercial laundry industry. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company, through our ePort Connect® service, will act as the exclusive service provider for all credit/debit card processing for all new customers of Setomatic’s SpyderWash, a credit/debit card acceptance product. Similarly, the Company will market its ePort Connect service in the United States laundry market exclusively through Setomatic. After the initial three-year term, the agreement has been renewing automatically for successive one-year periods but is subject to 120 days’ notice of non-renewal by either party.
Global Payments
For a vast majority of our customers who receive Seed vending management solutions and Seed cashless services from us, the credit and debit card transaction processing services are provided by Global Payments, Inc., formerly Heartland Payment Systems. We entered into a three-year agreement with Global Payments on April 6, 2018, pursuant to which Global Payments will act as the provider of credit and debit card transaction processing services (including authorization and conveyance) for transactions on points of sale owned or operated by our customers. For some of the customers, Global Payments serves as the merchant of record and settles funds directly to the customers, while for other customers, we serve as the merchant of record and will settle the transactions to the customer, after withholding monthly fees for cashless and vending management solutions. Our agreement with Global Payments automatically renews for successive one-year periods unless either party provides 60 days’ notice of non-renewal to the other party.
AT&T
In August 2017, we signed an agreement with AT&T for access to their LTE machine to machine wireless wide area network for the transport of data, including credit card transactions and inventory management data. The initial term of the agreement is five years. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one year periods unless terminated by either party upon thirty days’ notice.
QUICK START PROGRAM
In order to reduce customers’ upfront capital costs associated with the ePort hardware, the Company makes available to its customers the Quick Start program, pursuant to which the customer would enter into a five-year non-cancelable lease with either the Company or a third-party leasing company for the devices. At the end of the lease period, the customer would have the option to purchase the device for a nominal fee.
From its introduction in September 2014 and through approximately mid-March 2015, the Company entered into these leases directly with its customers. In the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, however, the Company signed vendor agreements with two leasing companies, whereby our customers could enter into leases directly with the leasing companies.
There has been a shift by our customers from acquiring our product via JumpStart (our rental program), which accounted for 11.51% of our gross connections in fiscal year 2018, and for 11.01% of our gross connections in fiscal year 2019. The shift to a straight purchase, along with our ability to increase cash collections under QuickStart sales by utilizing leasing companies, improves cash provided by operating activities.
Due to the success of the QuickStart program, as measured by customer utilization of the program and the positive impact on the Company’s cash flows from operating activities when a leasing company is utilized, the Company intends to expand this program by entering into additional vendor agreements with leasing companies and/or expanding its relationship with the three incumbent leasing companies.
JUMP START PROGRAM
Pursuant to the JumpStart Program, customers acquire the ePort cashless device at no upfront cost by paying a higher monthly service fee, avoiding the need to make a major upfront capital investment. The Company would continue to own the ePort device utilized by its customer. At the time of the shipment of the ePort device, the customer is obligated to pay to the Company a one-time activation fee, and is later obligated to pay monthly ePort Connect service fees in accordance with the terms of the customer’s 
17

contract with the Company, in addition to transaction processing fees generated from the device. In fiscal year 2019, the Company added approximately 6% of its gross new connections through JumpStart, compared to approximately 4% in fiscal year 2018.
MANUFACTURING
The Company utilizes independent third-party companies for the manufacturing of its products. Our internal manufacturing process mainly consists of quality assurance of materials and testing of finished goods received from our contract manufacturers. We have not entered into a long-term contract with our contract manufacturers, nor have we agreed to commit to purchase certain quantities of materials or finished goods from our manufacturers beyond those submitted under routine purchase orders, typically covering short-term forecasts.
COMPETITION
We are a leading provider of cashless payments systems for the small-ticket, unattended market in the United States, and believe we have the largest installed base of unattended POS electronic payment systems in the beverage and food vending industry in the United States. Factors that we consider to be our competitive advantages are described above under “OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS.” Our competitors are increasingly and actively marketing products and services that compete with our products and services in the vending space including manufacturers who may include in their new vending machines their own (or another third party’s) cashless payment systems and services. Our major competitor is Crane Payment Innovations. In addition to these competitors, there are also numerous credit card processors that offer card processing services to traditional retail establishments that could decide to offer similar services to the industries that we serve.
In the cashless laundry market, our joint solution with Setomatic Systems competes with hardware manufacturers, who provide joint solutions to their customers in partnership with payment processors, and with at least one competitor who provides an integrated hardware and payment processing solution.
