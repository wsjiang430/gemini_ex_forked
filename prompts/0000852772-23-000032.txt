Item 1.     Business
Description of Business

Denny’s Corporation, or the “Company”, a Delaware corporation, is one of America’s largest franchised full-service restaurant chains. The Company owns and operates the Denny’s brand (“Denny’s”) and the Keke’s Breakfast Cafe brand (“Keke’s”). As of December 28, 2022, the Company consisted of 1,656 restaurants, 1,582 of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and 74 of which were company operated.
The Denny’s Brand
Denny’s is known as “America’s Diner”, or in the case of our international locations, “the local diner.” Open 24/7 in most locations, we provide our guests quality food that emphasizes everyday value and new and innovative products through our compelling limited time only offerings, delivered in a warm, friendly “come as you are” atmosphere. Denny’s has been serving guests for nearly 70 years and is best known for its all day breakfast fare. The Build Your Own Grand Slam, one of our most popular menu items, traces its origin back to the Original Grand Slam which was first introduced in 1977. Denny’s offers a wide selection of lunch and dinner items including entrees, burgers, sandwiches and salads, along with an assortment of appetizers and desserts. We have four dayparts, breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night, accounting for 27%, 36%, 21% and 16%, respectively, of average daily sales. Weekends have traditionally been the most popular time for guests to visit our restaurants. In 2022, 38% of an average week of sales occurred from Friday late night through Sunday lunch. Additionally, off-premise sales, including sales for delivery and through our two virtual brands, represented approximately 21% of total sales in 2022.
As of December 28, 2022, the Denny’s brand consisted of 1,602 franchised, licensed and company restaurants around the world, including 1,445 restaurants in the United States and 157 international restaurant locations. As of December 28, 2022, 1,536 of Denny’s restaurants were franchised or licensed, representing 96% of the total Denny’s restaurants, and 66 were company restaurants.
The Keke’s Brand
We acquired Keke's on July 20, 2022. Keke’s is a daytime eatery dedicated to providing a consistently outstanding breakfast experience through fresh food that is made to order, excellent service from a welcoming staff, and a clean and comfortable environment. Open daily from 7:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m, Keke’s produces meals that are handmade using the best ingredients available, including fresh fruits and vegetables, and the highest quality bread and dairy products. In addition to breakfast items, Keke’s also serves burgers, paninis, salads, and sandwiches. Approximately 45% of Keke’s total weekly sales occur on the weekends, and off-premise sales, including sales for delivery, represented approximately 14% of total sales in 2022.
As of December 28, 2022, the Keke’s brand consisted of 54 franchised and company restaurants in Florida, of which 46, representing 85% of total Keke’s restaurants, were franchised and eight were company restaurants.
Segment Information
We manage our business by brand and as a result have identified two operating segments, Denny’s and Keke’s. In addition, we have identified Denny’s as a reportable segment. Keke’s is presented as a component of Other in our segment disclosures. Additional information about our segments can be found in Note 21, “Segment Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
References to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Form 10-K are references to Denny’s Corporation and its subsidiaries. Reference to “Denny’s” or “Keke’s” are references to the specific brand. Financial information about our operations, including our revenues and net income (loss) for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2022, December 29, 2021, and December 30, 2020, and our total assets as of December 28, 2022 and December 29, 2021, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Starting in 2020 and continuing through 2022, the global economic crisis resulting from the spread of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), along with government and consumer responses, has had a substantial impact on our restaurant operations, including impacts on labor and commodity costs and the ability of many Denny’s franchise restaurants to return to 24/7 operations. During 2020, many of our company and franchised and licensed restaurants were temporarily closed and most of the restaurants that remained open had limited operations. As of the end of 2022, many Denny’s restaurants have not returned to full operating hours, particularly at the late night daypart. Our operating results substantially depend upon the sales volumes, restaurant profitability, and financial stability of our company and franchised and licensed restaurants.
We cannot currently estimate the duration or future negative financial impact of these macroeconomic conditions on our business. See “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information relating to the impact of these macroeconomic on our business and financial results.
Franchising and Development
Franchising 

Our criteria to become a Denny’s franchisee include minimum liquidity and net worth requirements and appropriate operational experience. We believe that Denny’s is an attractive financial proposition for current and potential franchisees and that our fee structure is competitive with other full-service brands. Our current traditional twenty-year Denny’s franchise agreements have an initial fee of up to $30,000 and a royalty payment of up to 4.50% of gross sales. Additionally, our franchisees are required to contribute up to 3.25% of gross sales for marketing and may make additional advertising contributions as part of a local marketing co-operative. Approximately 82% of our Denny’s franchised restaurants were operating under this traditional agreement as of December 28, 2022. License agreements for nontraditional locations, such as university campuses, may contain higher royalty and lower advertising contribution rates than the traditional franchise agreements. Our domestic contractual royalty rate averaged approximately 4.39% during 2022.
We work closely with our franchisees to plan and execute many aspects of the business. The Denny’s Franchisee Association (“DFA”) was created to promote communication among our franchisees and between the Company and our franchise community. Members of the DFA’s board and Company management primarily work together through Brand Advisory Councils relating to Development, Marketing, Operations and Technology matters, as well as through a Supply Chain Oversight Committee for procurement and distribution matters.
Domestic Development

To accelerate the growth of the Denny’s brand in specific under-penetrated markets, we offer certain incentive programs. These programs provide incentives for franchisees to develop locations in areas where Denny’s has opportunities to grow market share. The benefits to franchisees can include reduced franchise fees, upfront cash payments, lower royalties and advertising contributions for a limited time period and credits toward certain development services, such as training fees.
In addition to these incentive programs, we increased our domestic development commitments through our refranchising and development strategy implemented during 2018 and 2019. These commitments were attached to the sale of 113 company restaurants during 2018 and 2019. At December 28, 2022, we had approximately 93 domestic development commitments.
International Development 

In addition to the development agreements signed for domestic restaurants, as of December 28, 2022, we had potential to develop approximately 118 international franchised Denny’s restaurants with our current development partners in various locations including Canada, Central America, Curacao, Indonesia, Mexico, the Middle East, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. The majority of these restaurants are expected to open over the next ten years. During 2022, we opened eight international franchised locations, including three in Canada, two in Mexico and one each in Curacao, Guatemala and the Philippines.
While we anticipate the majority of the Denny’s restaurants related to various domestic and international development agreements will be opened generally as scheduled, from time to time some of our franchisees’ ability to grow and meet their development commitments may be hampered by the economy, the lending environment or other circumstances. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deferred many of our domestic and international development commitments for one year or more from their original due date.
Franchise Focused Business Model
We expect the majority of our future restaurant openings and growth of the Denny’s brand to come primarily from the development of franchised restaurants. The table below sets forth information regarding the distribution of single-store and multi-store franchisees as of December 28, 2022:

Number of Denny’s Restaurants Owned | Franchisees | Percentage of Franchisees | | Restaurants | Percentage of Restaurants
One | 84 | | 38.4 | % | 84 | 5.5 | %
Two to five | 73 | | 33.3 | % | 225 | 14.6 | %
Six to ten | 27 | | 12.3 | % | 219 | 14.3 | %
Eleven to fifteen | 14 | | 6.4 | % | 172 | 11.2 | %
Sixteen to thirty | 10 | | 4.6 | % | 234 | 15.2 | %
Thirty-one and over | 11 | | 5.0 | % | 602 | 39.2 | %
Total | 219 | | 100.0 | % | 1,536 | 100.0 | %

Keke’s Development
Similar to Denny’s, we expect the majority of our future Keke’s restaurant openings and growth of the brand to come primarily from the development of franchised restaurants. However, we anticipate the first few Keke’s restaurant openings outside of Florida will likely be company operated restaurants to prove the appeal of the brand in new markets. 
Site Selection
The success of any restaurant is significantly influenced by its location. Our development teams work closely with franchisees and real estate brokers to identify sites that meet specific standards. Sites are evaluated based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
•demographics;
•traffic patterns;
•visibility;
•building constraints;
•competition;
•environmental restrictions; and
•proximity to high-traffic consumer activities.
Product Development and Marketing
The Denny’s name has been associated with high-quality, reasonably priced entrees, appetizers and beverages which have appealed to guests across all generations for nearly 70 years. As a leading full-service family dining brand, we’ve developed a craveable, indulgent menu that forges brand loyalty, attracts new guests to Denny’s and establishes the framework for our primary marketing strategies.
Menu Offerings
As “America’s Diner,” Denny’s has created a menu that offers a large selection of craveable, indulgent products served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for all guests. We offer a wide variety of entrées for breakfast, lunch, dinner and late-night dining as well as appetizers, desserts and beverages. Most Denny’s restaurants also offer special menu items for children and seniors at reduced prices. We consistently optimize our product offering to further align with consumer needs, which includes enhancing our core “breakfast all day” platform while providing everyday affordability, abundant value menu items, such as Super Slam, and delivering compelling core menu and limited-time-only products. Our menu items are conveniently enjoyed by guests either in our restaurants, via pick-up, curb-side delivery or delivery through our Denny’s on Demand platform and third-party delivery providers.
Denny’s on Demand is our internal digital ordering platform that provides guests with a personalized experience by enabling them to order whatever they want, whenever they want. Guests simply have to log onto the new Denny’s mobile app or online 
for takeout or delivery to wherever they want to enjoy their favorite Denny’s items. Our new mobile app also grants Denny’s Rewards members access to their digital wallets to receive rewards and promotions, both in-restaurant and online.
Product Development

Denny’s is a consumer-driven brand focusing on hospitality, menu choices and the overall guest experience. Our Product Development team innovates menu items that delight our guests during each visit. This team works to understand the most up-to-date trends through consumer insights from primary and secondary qualitative and quantitative studies and ideas from our franchisees, vendors and operators. These insights come together to form the strategic foundation for menu architecture, pricing, promotion and advertising. 
Our guests are the center of all menu innovations at Denny’s. Before introducing a new menu item to market, we rigorously test it against consumer expectations, standards of culinary discipline, food science and technology, nutritional analysis, financial benefit and operational execution. This testing process ensures that new menu items are not only appealing, competitive, profitable and marketable, but can be prepared and delivered with excellence in our restaurants.
We continually evolve our menu through new innovations and improvements to meet the needs of ever-changing consumer and marketplace.
Product Sources and Availability

Most food products, paper and packaging supplies, and equipment used in all company and franchised restaurant operations are distributed to individual restaurants by third-party distribution companies. Our centralized purchasing programs are designed to ensure uniform product quality as well as to minimize food, beverage and supply costs. The size of our brands provide significant purchasing power, which often enables us to obtain products at favorable prices from nationally recognized suppliers.
In the U.S., the majority of Denny’s products are purchased and distributed through McLane Company, Inc. under a long-term distribution contract. Outside the U.S., we and our International Denny’s franchisees primarily use decentralized sourcing and distribution systems involving many different global, regional and local suppliers and distributors. Our international franchisees generally select and manage their own third-party suppliers and distributors, subject to our internal standards. All suppliers and distributors are expected to provide products and/or services that comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the state and/or country in which they operate as well as comply with our internal standards.
We believe that satisfactory alternative sources of supplies are generally available for all of the items regularly used by our restaurants. We have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, or other products which are necessary to our restaurant operations.
Marketing and Advertising

We deploy national, local and co-operative marketing strategies to promote and amplify Denny’s brand strengths as “America’s Diner.” Through integrated marketing strategies, we promote our various breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night menu offerings and premium limited-time-only offerings as well as the convenience of online ordering and payment for pick up or delivery. 
Through our Marketing team, Denny’s anticipates consumer and market trends and fully leverages consumer insights to determine strategies for brand communication and demand generation. We participate in comprehensive, integrated marketing activities, including print, broadcast, radio, digital and social advertising; multicultural marketing; public relations and brand reputation; customer relationship management, field marketing; and national and local promotions.
Restaurant Operations
Management & Operations

We believe that the consistent and reliable execution of basic restaurant operations in each of our restaurants, whether it is company or franchised, is critical to our success. We expect both our company and franchised restaurants to maintain the same high brand standards. Our standards are, and have been, critical to the brand’s success. They include best in class quality and preparation of food, meeting and exceeding our guests’ expectations for service, cleanliness and value and providing a friendly experience at each restaurant.
Brand Protection, Quality & Regulatory Compliance
Maintaining brand standards is of the utmost importance for each of our brands. We pride ourself in serving our guests food that is safe, wholesome and meets our quality standards. Our systems are based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (“HACCP”) principles. To ensure this basic expectation of our guests, we have systems in place that require solely the use of approved vendors and distributors which can meet and follow our product specifications and food handling procedures. Vendors, distributors and restaurant employees follow regulatory requirements (federal, state and local), industry “best practices” and Brand Standards.
Human Capital

Human capital management considerations are at the core of Our Guiding Principles, the drivers of which include leveraging our culture of belonging and the capability of our people to fuel brand performance and franchise success, as well as recruiting and equipping the best restaurant operators in the world to deliver great customer experiences. As of December 28, 2022, we had approximately 3,700 employees of whom approximately 3,300 were employees of our company-owned restaurants and approximately 400 were corporate employees at our restaurant support centers or in the field. Our commitments and progress towards executing this strategy in support of employee experience and performance are reflected below.
Be Well
We focus on the whole person. 
We offer comprehensive benefits that support our team members and their families’ overall well-being. We also contribute to programs that provide our team members with financial security, now and in the future. We offer a robust set of benefits and rewards that focus on recognition, career building, health and wellness, and other perks that are designed to make our employees’ experience productive and fun. We assess our culture and listen to our workforce through periodic employee engagement surveys. Numerous policy changes have been made or been influenced by the feedback we receive from our employees. 
We are proud to offer an Employee Assistance Program to all employees and family members. This confidential program is available 24/7 for personal or professional consultations. In addition, we provide our employees with access to a 401(k) savings plan, tuition reimbursement, life insurance options, and a competitive vacation policy. Our compensation and performance evaluation systems are carefully designed to maintain pay equity by focusing pay decisions on experience and performance to ensure the Company retains a highly productive workforce to operate our business while providing a high level of service to our guests. 
Learning and Development
We invest in team members’ success through education and training. Our Breakthrough Leadership Training and Development program provides our team members with exclusive access to numerous creative and interactive employee engagement curricula, leadership workshops, simulations, mobile learning and educational training videos. This unique program helps develop a wide range of skills, including leadership, people management, guest service, inventory management, food preparation and food safety—skills that help workers successfully operate in the restaurant industry.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Our investment in people includes creating a culture of belonging that attracts, retains and fosters the growth of the best people and creates high performance in our restaurants. We value and are proud of our community engagement including our investment in causes that are important to our people and communities, such as our education initiatives through our Denny’s Hungry for EducationTM Scholarship program, helping fight childhood hunger, and supporting diverse and disadvantaged businesses.
Additional components of our strategic areas of focus include:
Business Resource Leadership Groups
We have established seven business resource leadership groups for our employees to provide encouragement and an enhanced sense of belonging through informal mentoring, participation in professional and community events and access to personal and professional development and growth opportunities. Additionally, they help foster a more inclusive work environment, improve communication and trust among employees and enhance understanding of all employees about the value of diversity. The seven 
business resource groups include the African American Leadership Group, Asian Pacific Islander Leadership Group, Emerging Leaders Group, Hispanic Leadership Group, LGBTQ+ Leadership Group, Veterans Leadership Group, and Women’s Leadership Group. 
Diversity Council
Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council collaborates on initiatives designed to renew our workplace and create business results that will increase and strengthen the reputations of our brands, guest satisfaction and market share. The council consists of 19 cross-functional members representing various positions throughout our organization, who serve as ambassadors, bridge builders, data collectors, educators, accountability partners and champions of DEI within our brands.
Diversity by the Numbers
Diverse team members make up approximately:
•75% of our total workforce and 72% of restaurant management
•63% of our restaurants are owned by diverse franchisees
◦Of the 63%, 21% are owned by women who are actively engaged in the business
•Our Board of Directors consists of nine directors – 56% are from a diverse background and 44% are women
•6% of our total restaurants are owned by members of the LGBTQ+ community
We believe in accountability that starts with our leadership and extends to all of our team members. We have a world class DEI philosophy embraced by our workforce and we commit to support other companies in doing the same. 

Information Technology
The mission of our Information Technology department is to align our technology strategy in support of our business strategies. We focus on leveraging technology to drive efficiencies, simplify and standardize operations, and streamline the guest experience. We also deliver solutions that support financial and regulatory needs in addition to necessary business improvements. 
We rely on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations. At the restaurant level, systems include point-of-sale platforms along with systems and tools for kitchen operations, labor scheduling, inventory management, cash management and credit card transaction processing. Our technology platform includes industry-standard market solutions as well as proprietary software and integration, yielding tools and information managers need to run efficient and effective restaurants. We invest in new technologies and R&D efforts to improve operations and enhance the guest experience through innovative solutions like online ordering and payment for pick-up and delivery.
At the corporate level, we have a robust Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) platform that supports finance, accounting, human resources and payroll functions. Our ERP is a cloud-based market solution, enabling us to take advantage of continual software improvements aligned with industry best practices. We also have and are continuing to develop systems that consolidate and report on data from our franchised and company restaurants, including transaction-level detail. These systems are collectively supported by an enterprise network that facilitates seamless connectivity for applications and data throughout our business infrastructure. 
Our information technology systems have been designed to protect against unauthorized access and data loss. We are continuously focused on enhancing our cybersecurity capabilities. We are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard (“DSS”) compliance. We are also required to protect critical and sensitive data for our employees, customers, and the Company. These standards are set by a consortium of major credit card companies and require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers’ credit card and other personal information. We have deployed payment technologies that are Europay, Mastercard, Visa (“EMV”) certified, and we employ point-to-point encryption to ensure no credit card data is stored within our restaurants. Further, we monitor franchisees’ compliance with PCI standards.  
We have augmented our technology infrastructure, primarily within digital and in-restaurant systems, to support the changing dynamics of our industry and guest expectations. These enhancements were introduced through our standard change control mechanisms and followed prescribed standards for testing and introduction into our environment. There were no material changes introduced into the core of our technology operating systems, and all PCI—DSS compliance standards were followed.
In addition to technology changes in direct response to changing business and guest expectations, we have benefited from our prior focus and investments in various technology platforms over the past few years. These investments include our ERP platform and enterprise communication and collaboration tools, which prepared us to make a quick transition from a centralized to a remote workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic with no significant additional risk or negative impact to business processing and continuity. These same investments that allowed us to transition to a remote workforce continue to support a hybrid wok environment under which many of our employees split time between working centrally and remotely.
In 2022, upon the acquisition of Keke’s, we integrated Keke’s systems and data into the enterprise systems currently employed. All Keke’s business leaders and employees outside the physical restaurant were provided with workstations that meet our existing standards for security and performance. Work is underway with Keke’s leadership to prioritize additional technology investments within the restaurants to support the needs of the brand, while also continuing the focus on security, scalability, and standardization. 
See “Risk Factors” for further information regarding Information Technology. 
Seasonality

Restaurant sales are generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters (April through September) than in the fourth and first calendar quarters (October through March). Additionally, severe weather, storms and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions.
Trademarks and Service Marks

Through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we have certain trademarks and service marks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in international jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, “Denny’s®,”  and “Keke’s Breakfast Cafe®.”  We consider our trademarks and service marks important to the identification of our company and franchised restaurants and believe they are of material importance to the conduct of our business. In addition, we have registered various domain names on the internet that incorporate certain of our trademarks and service marks. We believe these domain name registrations are an integral part of our identity. From time to time, we may resort to legal measures to defend and protect the use of our intellectual property. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
Competition

The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Restaurants compete on the basis of name recognition and advertising; the price, quality, variety and perceived value of their food offerings; the quality and speed of their guest service; the location and attractiveness of their facilities; and the convenience of to-go ordering and delivery options.

Our direct competition in the full-service category includes a collection of national and regional chains, as well as thousands of independent operators. We also compete with quick service restaurants as they attempt to upgrade their menus with premium sandwiches, entrée salads, new breakfast offerings and extended hours as well as grocery store chains as they enhance their ready-to-eat offerings to consumers.

We believe we have a number of competitive strengths, including strong brand recognition, well-located restaurants and market penetration. We benefit from economies of scale in a variety of areas, including advertising, purchasing and distribution. Additionally, we believe that we have competitive strengths in the value, variety and quality of our food products, and in the quality and training of our employees. See “Risk Factors” for additional factors relating to our competition in the restaurant industry.

Economic, Market and Other Conditions

The restaurant industry is affected by many factors, including changes in national, regional and local economic conditions affecting consumer spending; the political environment (including acts of war and terrorism); changes in customer travel patterns including changes in the price of gasoline; changes in socio-demographic characteristics of areas where restaurants are located; changes in consumer tastes and preferences; food safety and health concerns; outbreaks of flu or other viruses (such as the coronavirus) or other diseases; increases in the number of restaurants; and unfavorable trends affecting restaurant operations, such as rising wage rates, health care costs, utility expenses and unfavorable weather. See “Risk Factors” for additional information.
Government Regulations

We and our franchisees are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing various aspects of the restaurant business, such as compliance with various minimum wage, overtime, health care, sanitation, food safety, citizenship, and fair labor standards, as well as laws and regulations relating to safety, fire, zoning, building, consumer protection and taxation. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws governing franchise sales and the franchise relationship, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of such laws. 
Following the World Health Organization’s declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, federal, state and local governments responded by implementing restrictions on travel, “stay at home” directives, “social distancing” guidance, limitations of dine-in food service, and mandated dining room closures which collectively had a significant adverse impact on the Company’s business performance, results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 29, 2021 and December 30, 2020. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussion.
The operation of our franchise system is also subject to regulations enacted by a number of states and rules promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission. Such regulations impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may also apply substantive standards to the relationship between franchisor and franchisee, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate or alter franchise agreements. Due to our international franchising, we are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
We believe we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we cannot predict the effect on operations of the enactment of additional regulations in the future.
We have implemented various aspects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act. However, the law or other related requirements may change. 
See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks related to governmental regulation of our business.
