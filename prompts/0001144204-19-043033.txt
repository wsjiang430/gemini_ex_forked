Item 1. Business.
GENERAL
 
The InterGroup Corporation (“InterGroup” or the “Company” and may also be referred to as “we” “us” or “our” in this report) is a Delaware corporation formed in 1985, as the successor to Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust ("M-REIT"), a New York real estate investment trust created in 1965. The Company has been a publicly-held company since M-REIT's first public offering of shares in 1966.
 
The Company was organized to buy, develop, operate, rehabilitate and dispose of real property of various types and descriptions, and to engage in such other business and investment activities as would benefit the Company and its shareholders. The Company was founded upon, and remains committed to, social responsibility. Such social responsibility was originally defined as providing decent and affordable housing to people without regard to race. In 1985, after examining the impact of federal, state and local equal housing laws, the Company determined to broaden its definition of social responsibility. The Company changed its form from a REIT to a corporation so that it could pursue a variety of investments beyond real estate and broaden its social impact to engage in any opportunity which would offer the potential to increase shareholder value within the Company's underlying commitment to social responsibility.
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company owned approximately 82.2% of the common shares of Santa Fe Financial Corporation (“Santa Fe”), a public company (OTC Market Inc.’s Pink: SFEF). Santa Fe’s revenue is primarily generated through its 68.8% owned subsidiary, Portsmouth Square, Inc. (“Portsmouth”), a public company (OTC Market Inc.’s Pink: PRSI). InterGroup also directly owns approximately 13.4% of Portsmouth. Portsmouth’s primary business is conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors, a California limited partnership (“Justice” or the “Partnership”). Portsmouth has a 93.3% limited partnership interest in Justice and is the sole general partner. The financial statements of Justice are consolidated with those of the Company.
 
Justice, through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC (“Operating”) and Justice Mezzanine Company, LLC (“Mezzanine”), owns a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the “Hotel”) and related facilities including a five-level underground parking garage. Kearny Street Parking LLC (“Parking”) is the operator of the garage. Mezzanine is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating. The Hotel is operated by the partnership as a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC (Hilton). Justice had a ten-year management agreement with Prism Hospitality L.P. (“Prism”) to perform certain management functions for the Hotel. Prism’s management agreement was terminated upon its expiration date of February 2, 2017. Justice entered into a hotel management agreement (“HMA”) with Interstate Management Company, LLC (“Interstate”) to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The term of the HMA is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, not to exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Interstate shall be one and seven-tenths (1.70%) of total Hotel revenue.
 
In addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership, management and, when appropriate, sale of real estate. Properties include sixteen apartment complexes, one commercial real estate property and three single-family houses. The properties are located throughout the United States but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has an investment in unimproved real property. As of June 30, 2019, all of the Company’s operating real estate properties are managed in-house.
 
The Company acquires its investments in real estate and other investments utilizing cash, securities or debt, subject to approval or guidelines of the Board of Directors and its Real Estate Investment Committee. The Company may also look for new real estate investment opportunities in hotels, apartments, office buildings and development properties. The acquisition of any new real estate investments will depend on the Company’s ability to find suitable investment opportunities and the availability of sufficient financing to acquire such investments. To help fund any such acquisition, the Company may borrow funds to leverage its investment capital. The amount of any such debt will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the availability of financing and the sufficiency of the acquisition property’s projected cash flows to support the operations and debt service.

The Company also may derive income from the investment of its cash and investment securities assets. The Company has invested in income-producing instruments, equity and debt securities and will consider other investments if such investments offer growth or profit potential. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the Company’s marketable securities and other investments.
 
HILTON HOTELS FRANCHISE LICENSE AGREEMENT
 
The Partnership entered into a Franchise License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with the HLT Existing Franchise Holding LLC (“Hilton”) on December 10, 2004. The term of the License Agreement was for an initial period of fifteen years commencing on the date the Hotel began operating as a Hilton hotel, with an option to extend the License Agreement for another five years, subject to certain conditions. On June 26, 2015, Operating and Hilton entered into an amended franchise agreement that, among other things, extended the License Agreement through 2030, and also provided the Partnership with certain key money cash incentives to be earned through 2030.
HOTEL MANAGEMENT COMPANY AGREEMENT
 
On February 1, 2017, Justice entered into a hotel management agreement with Interstate Management Company, LLC to manage the Hotel with an effective takeover date of February 3, 2017. The term of the hotel management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on the takeover date and automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, not to exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Interstate shall be one and seven-tenths (1.70%) of total Hotel revenue. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, Interstate management fees were $1,206,000 and $957,000, respectively, and are included in Hotel operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As part of the HMA, Interstate, through the Partnership’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Street Parking LLC, manages the parking garage in-house.
CHINESE CULTURE FOUNDATION LEASE
 
On March 15, 2005, the Partnership entered into an amended lease with the Chinese Culture Foundation of San Francisco (the “Foundation”) for the third-floor space of the Hotel commonly known as the Chinese Culture Center, which the Foundation had right to occupy pursuant to a 50-year nominal rent lease that began in 1967.
 
The amended lease, among other things, requires the Partnership to pay to the Foundation a monthly event space fee in the amount of $5,000, adjusted annually based on the local Consumer Price Index. As of June 30, 2019, monthly event space fee is $6,200. The term of the amended lease expires on October 17, 2023, with an automatic extension for another 10-year term if the property continues to be operated as a hotel. Subject to certain conditions as set forth in the amended lease, the Foundation is entitled to reserve for a maximum of 75 days per calendar year for use of the event space. In the event that the Partnership needs the event space during one of the dates previously reserved by the Foundation, the Partnership shall pay the Foundation $4,000 per day for using the event space. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Partnership paid the Foundation $13,000 and $50,000, respectively, for using the event space on previously reserved dates by the Foundation.
 
SALES AND REFINANCINGS OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES
 
In July 2015, the Company purchased a residential house in Los Angeles, California as a strategic asset for $1,975,000 in cash. In August 2016, the Company obtained a $1,000,000 mortgage note payable on this property and received net proceeds of $983,000. The interest on the note is 5.75% with interest only payments for twenty-three months. In September 2018, the Company refinanced the mortgage note payable with a new mortgage in the amount of $1,000,000. The interest rate on the mortgage is 4.75% and matures in October 2048.
 
In July 2018, the Company obtained a revolving $5,000,000 line of credit (“RLOC”) from CIBC Bank USA (“CIBC”). The RLOC carries a variable interest rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 3%. Interest is paid on a monthly basis. The RLOC and all accrued and unpaid interest are due in July 2019. On July 31, 2018, $2,969,000 was drawn from the RLOC to pay off the mortgage note payable at our 27-unit apartment complex in Los Angeles. In July 2019, the Company obtained a modification from CIBC which increased the RLOC by $3,000,000 and extended the maturity date from July 24, 2019 to July 23, 2020. As of June 30, 2019, outstanding balance of the RLOC is $2,985,000.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICIES
 
In addition to its Hotel and real estate operations, the Company also invests from time to time in income producing instruments, corporate debt and equity securities, publicly traded investment funds, mortgage backed securities, securities issued by REITs and other companies which invest primarily in real estate.
 
The Company’s securities investments are made under the supervision of a Securities Investment Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”). The Committee currently has three members and is chaired by the Company’s Chairman of the Board and President, John V. Winfield. The Committee has delegated authority to manage the portfolio to the Company’s Chairman and President together with such assistants and management committees he may engage. The Committee generally follows certain established investment guidelines for the Company’s investments. These guidelines presently include: (i) corporate equity securities should be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca or the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ); (ii) the issuer of the listed securities should be in compliance with the listing standards of the applicable national securities exchange; and (iii) investment in a particular issuer should not exceed 10% of the market value of the total portfolio. The investment guidelines do not require the Company to divest itself of investments, which initially meet these guidelines but subsequently fail to meet one or more of the investment criteria. The Committee has in the past approved non-conforming investments and may in the future approve non-conforming investments. The Committee may modify these guidelines from time to time.
 
The Company may also invest, with the approval of the Securities Investment Committee, in unlisted securities, such as convertible notes, through private placements including private equity investment funds. Those investments in non-marketable securities are carried at cost on the Company’s balance sheet as part of other investments and reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had other investments of $612,000 and $813,000, respectively.
 
As part of its investment strategies, the Company may assume short positions in marketable securities. Short sales are used by the Company to potentially offset normal market risks undertaken in the course of its investing activities or to provide additional return opportunities. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the Company had obligations for securities sold (equities short) of $1,225,000 and $1,935,000, respectively.
 
In addition, the Company may utilize margin for its marketable securities purchases through the use of standard margin agreements with national brokerage firms. The margin used by the Company may fluctuate depending on market conditions. The use of leverage could be viewed as risky and the market values of the portfolio may be subject to large fluctuations. Margin balances due at June 30, 2019 and 2018 were $1,629,000 and $1,887,000, respectively.
 
As Chairman of the Securities Investment Committee, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), John V. Winfield, directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Mr. Winfield also serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Portsmouth and Santa Fe and oversees the investment activity of those companies. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive Officer, Portsmouth and Santa Fe may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the resources of the Portsmouth and Santa Fe, at risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on behalf of the Company.
 
Further information with respect to investment in marketable securities and other investments of the Company is set forth in Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Seasonality
 
Hotel’s operations historically have been seasonal. Like most hotels in the San Francisco area, the Hotel generally maintains high occupancy and room rates during the entire year except for the weeks starting Thanksgiving through the end of the calendar year due to the holiday season. These seasonal patterns can be expected to cause fluctuations in the quarterly revenues of the Hotel.

Competition 
 
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on a number of factors, most notably convenience of location, brand affiliation, price, range of services and guest amenities or accommodations offered and quality of customer service. Competition is often specific to the individual market in which properties are located. The San Francisco market is a very competitive market with a high supply of guest rooms and meeting space in the area. During fiscal year 2019, we installed an advanced state-of-the-art internet system which included a rewiring of the entire hotel with the best possible Ethernet cabling and fiber. Specifically, the complete overhaul of the infrastructure of the Internet in the guest rooms and meeting space will enable the Hotel to compete in this market from a technology perspective. This investment is allowing the Hotel to go to market with measurable statistics that will help win the much-coveted technology company meetings. We installed 55” and 65” 4K smart televisions in all guest rooms and common areas during fiscal year 2019. In fiscal 2018, an architecture firm was contracted to design the new guest rooms which have recently been approved by Hilton and the model rooms are underway. We plan to bring back into service 14 guest rooms on the 5th floor as part of the initial phase of this renovation project and the next phase will include additional rooms being added on the 26th and 27th floors. We anticipate our window washing equipment to be completed within the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.
 
Our highest priority is guest satisfaction. We believe that enhancing the guest experience differentiates the Hotel from our competition and is critical to the Hotel’s objective of building sustainable guest loyalty. In order to make a large impact on guest experience, the Hotel will continue training team members on Hilton brand standards and guest satisfaction, hiring and retaining talents in key operations, and enhancing the arrival experience.
 
The Hotel’s location in the San Francisco Financial District lends itself to greater opportunities over its competitors when it comes to developing relationships with the Financial District entities and the customers who regularly do business in the downtown area. The ability to capitalize on the strong midweek demand of the individual business traveler to the Financial District has been the focus during the timeframe of strong growth in the market. The Hotel will continue to focus on self-contained group business that contributes to the Food and Beverage operation and make use of the properties meeting space capabilities. Closure of the Moscone Convention Center has limited banquet revenue contribution in fiscal year 2019 but assisted in strong rate growth year over year. With the Moscone Convention Center returning to full capacity in calendar year 2019, we hope to see more growth in citywide room nights.
 
The Hotel is also subject to certain operating risks common to all of the hotel industry, which could adversely impact performance. These risks include:
 

· | Competition for guests and meetings from other hotels including competition and pricing pressure from internet wholesalers and distributors; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increases in operating costs, including wages, benefits, insurance, property taxes and energy, due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset in the future by increased room rates; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labor strikes, disruptions or lock outs;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers, which may fluctuate and is seasonal; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | increases in energy costs, cost of fuel, airline fares and other expenses related to travel, which may negatively affect traveling; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | terrorism, terrorism alerts and warnings, wars and other military actions, pandemics or other medical events or warnings which may result in decreases in business and leisure travel; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | natural disasters; and
--+-----------------------


· | adverse effects of downturns and recessionary conditions in international, national and/or local economies and market conditions. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Matters 
 
In connection with the ownership of the Hotel, the Company is subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.
 
Environmental consultants retained by the Partnership or its lenders conducted updated Phase I environmental site assessments in fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 on the Hotel property. These Phase I assessments relied, in part, on Phase I environmental assessments prepared in connection with the Partnership’s first mortgage loan obtained in December 2013. Phase I assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties based generally upon site inspections, facility personnel interviews, historical information and certain publicly-available databases; however, Phase I assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties.
 
Although the Phase I assessments and other environmental reports we have reviewed disclose certain conditions on our property and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability, we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
 
The Company believes that the Hotel is in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company has not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of its present properties.
 
Competition – Rental Properties
 
The ownership, operation and leasing of multifamily rental properties are highly competitive. The Company competes with domestic and foreign financial institutions, other REITs, life insurance companies, pension trusts, trust funds, partnerships and individual investors. In addition, The Company competes for tenants in markets primarily on the basis of property location, rent charged, services provided and the design and condition of improvements. The Company also competes with other quality apartment owned by public and private companies. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular market could adversely affect the Company’s ability to lease its multifamily properties, as well as the rents it is able to charge. In addition, other forms of residential properties, including single family housing and town homes, provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for-sale condominium units. The Company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on resident service and amenity offerings and the desirability of the Company’s locations. Resident leases at the Company’s apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions, supply and demand characteristics, and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of June 30, 2019, the Company had a total of 28 full-time employees. Effective August 2014, the Company entered into a client service agreement with ADP, a professional employer organization serving as an off-site, full service human resource department for its employees. ADP personnel management services are delivered by entering into a co-employment relationship with the Company’s employees. The employees and the Company are not party to any collective bargaining agreement, and the Company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory.
 
Effective February 3, 2017, the Partnership had no employees. On February 3, 2017, Interstate assumed all labor union agreements and retained employees of their choice to continue providing services to the Hotel. As of June 30, 2019, approximately 85% of those employees were represented by one of four labor unions, and their terms of employment were determined under various collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) to which the Partnership was a party. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Partnership renewed the CBA for Local 39 (Stationary Engineers), and Local 665 (Parking Employees). CBA for Local 2 (Hotel and Restaurant Employees) expired on August 13, 2018 and was renewed in August 2019. CBA for Local 856 (International Brotherhood of Teamsters) will expire on December 31, 2022.
 
Negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, which includes not just terms and conditions of employment, but scope and coverage of employees, is a regular and expected course of business operations for the Partnership and Interstate. The Partnership expects and anticipates that the terms of conditions of CBAs will have an impact on wage and benefit costs, operating expenses, and certain hotel operations during the life of each CBA, and incorporates these principles into its operating and budgetary practices.
