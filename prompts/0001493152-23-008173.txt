Item 1. BUSINESS
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
LadRx Corporation (“LadRx” or the Company) is a biopharmaceutical research and development company specializing in oncology. The Company’s focus is on the discovery, research and clinical development of novel anti-cancer drug candidates that employ novel technologies that target chemotherapeutic drugs to solid tumors and reduce off-target toxicities. During 2017, the Company’s discovery laboratory in Freiburg, Germany synthesized and tested over 75 rationally designed drug candidates with highly potent anti-cancer payloads, culminating in the creation of two distinct classes of compounds. Four lead candidates (LADR-7 through LADR-10) were selected based on in vitro and animal studies in several different cancer models, and based on stability and manufacturing feasibility. In addition, a novel companion diagnostic, ACDx™, was developed to identify patients with cancer who are most likely to benefit from treatment with these drug candidates. However, the Company’s research and development activities have been curtailed as they seek additional financing.
 
On June 1, 2018, the Company launched Centurion BioPharma Corporation (“Centurion”), a private subsidiary, and transferred all of its assets, liabilities and personnel associated with the laboratory operations in Freiburg, Germany. In connection with said transfer, the Company and Centurion entered into a Management Services Agreement whereby the Company agreed to render advisory, consulting, financial and administrative services to Centurion, for which Centurion shall reimburse the Company for the cost of such services plus a 5% service charge. On December 21, 2018, LadRx announced that Centurion had concluded the pre-clinical phase of development for its four LADR™ drug candidates, and for its albumin companion diagnostic (ACDx™). As a result of completing this work, operations taking place at the pre-clinical laboratory in Freiburg, Germany were no longer needed and, accordingly, the lab was closed at the end of January 2019.
 
On March 9, 2022, Centurion merged with and into LadRx, with LadRx absorbing all of Centurion’s assets and continuing after the merger as the surviving entity (the “Merger”). The Merger was implemented through an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to Section 253 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and did not require approval from either our or Centurion’s stockholders. The Certificate of Ownership merging Centurion into LadRx was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on March 9, 2022.
 
Effective September 26, 2022, the Company changed its name from CytRx Corporation to LadRx Corporation pursuant to a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Certificate of Incorporation”) filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware. In accordance with the DGCL, its board of directors (the “Board”) approved the name change and the Certificate of Amendment. Pursuant to Section 242(b)(1) of the DGCL, stockholder approval was not required for the name change or the Certificate of Amendment.
 
LadRx is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1985. Our corporate offices are located at 11726 San Vicente Boulevard, Suite 650, Los Angeles, California 90049, and our telephone number is (310) 826-5648. Our web site is located at http://www.ladrxcorp.com. We do not incorporate by reference into this Annual Report the information on, or accessible through, our website, and you should not consider it as part of this Annual Report.
 
LADR Drug Discovery Platform
 
The LADR Technology offers the opportunity for multiple pipeline drugs. The Company’s LADR™ (Linker Activated Drug Release) technology platform consists of an organic backbone that is attached to a chemotoxic agent. The purpose of the LADR™ backbone is to first target and deliver the chemotoxic agent to the tumor environment, and then to release the chemotoxic agent within the tumor. By delivering, concentrating, and releasing the chemotoxic agent within the tumor, one expects to reduce the off-target side-effects of the chemotherapeutic, which in turn allows for several-fold higher dosing of the chemotherapeutic to the patient. Being small organic molecules, the Company expects LADR-based drugs to offer the benefits of targeting the tumor without the complexity, side effects, and expense inherent in macromolecules such as antibodies and nanoparticles.
 
The Company’s LADR-based drugs use circulating albumin as the binding target and as the trojan horse to deliver the LADR™ drugs to the tumor. Albumin is the most abundant protein in plasma and accumulates inside tumors due to the aberrant vascular structure that exists within solid tumors. Tumors use albumin as a nutritional source and for transport of signaling and other molecules that are important to the maintenance and growth of the tumor, which makes albumin an excellent target for drugs that are intended for solid tumors.

The Company’s LADR™ development efforts are focused on two classes of ultra-high potency albumin-binding drugs. These LADR-based drugs, LADR7, 8, 9, and 10, combine the proprietary LADR™ backbone with novel derivatives of the auristatin and maytansinoid drug classes. Auristatin and maytansinoid are highly potent chemotoxins, and require targeting to the tumor for safe administration to humans, as is the case for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved drugs Adcetris (auristatin antibody-drug-conjugate by Seagen) and Kadcyla (maytansine antibody-drug-conjugate by Genentech). We believe that LADR-based drugs offer the benefits of tumor targeting without the disadvantages of antibodies and other macromolecules, which include expense, complexity, and negative side effects. Additionally, albumin is a very well-characterized drug target, which we believe will reduce clinical and regulatory costs and risks.
 
The Company’s postulated mechanism of action for LADR-based drugs is as follows:
 

● | after administration, the linker portion of the drug conjugate forms a rapid and specific covalent bond to the cysteine-34 position of circulating albumin; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | circulating albumin preferentially accumulates in tumors due to a mechanism called “Enhanced Permeability and Retention”, which results in lower exposure to the drug in noncancerous tissues of the heart, liver, and other organs; 
● | once localized at the tumor, the acid-sensitive linker of the LADR™ backbone is cleaved due to the specific conditions within the tumor and in the tumor microenvironment; and 
● | free active drug is then released within the tumor, causing tumor cell death. 

 
The first-generation LADR-based drug is called aldoxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin is the drug doxorubicin attached to the first generation LADR™ backbone (LADRs 7-10 employ a next generation LADR™ backbone). Aldoxorubicin has been administered to over 600 human subjects in human clinical trials and has proven the concept of LADR™ in that several-fold more doxorubicin can be safely administered to patients when the doxorubicin is attached to LADR™ than when administered as native doxorubicin. Aldoxorubicin has been licensed to ImmunityBio, Inc. (formerly known as NantCell, Inc.) (“ImmunityBio”), and is currently in a Phase II registrational intent trial for pancreatic cancer. Aldoxorubicin is expected to enter a Phase I/II trial for glioblastoma in 2023.
 
The next generation LADR™ drugs are termed LADR7, 8, 9, and 10. A great deal of Investigational New Drug (“IND”) enabling work has already been accomplished on LADR7-10, including in-silico modeling, in-vitro efficacy testing in several different cancer models, in-vivo dosing, safety, and efficacy testing in several different cancer models in animals. We have also developed and proven manufacturability, an important step prior to beginning human clinical trials.
 
The IND-enabling work that remains prior to applying to the FDA for first-in-human studies for LADR7-10 is limited due to the extensive experimentation already completed. For example, in the case of LADR7, a manufacturing run under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) must be completed and some toxicology studies completed using the GMP material must be completed in animals. Toxicology studies with LADR7 have already been completed with non-GMP manufactured drug. Management estimates that these final IND-enabling activities for LADR7 would take approximately 12 months to complete, once funded and initiated, and that first-in-human dosing would be achieved within approximately 6-9 months after completion of the IND-enabling studies. Management further estimates that the cost to manufacture GMP material for one LADR™ drug, for example LADR7, complete all pre-IND studies, and to obtain an IND could be approximately $2 million in direct costs, based on current estimates, representing a capital-efficient path to clinical entry.
 
Because the LADR™ backbone in future products would be the same as the LADR™ backbone in current product candidates, (i.e. the chemotoxin can be changed without changing the LADR™ backbone), management anticipates that future product candidates beyond LADR7-10 may enjoy abbreviated pre-clinical pathways to first-in-human. Such abbreviated pathways would be subject to FDA review and agreement.

The Company’s novel companion diagnostic, ACDx™ (albumin companion diagnostic) was developed to identify patients with cancer who are most likely to benefit from treatment with the four LADR™ lead assets. We have not yet determined whether the use of a companion diagnostic will be necessary or helpful, and plan to continue to investigate this question in parallel to the pre-clinical and clinical development of LADRs 7-10.
 
The LADR™ backbone and drugs that employ LADR™ are protected by domestic and international patents, and additional patents are pending.
 
Business Strategy for LADR™ Platform
 
Throughout 2022, with the assistance of oncology drug development experts, the Company has inventoried the IND-enabling data for LADRs 7-10, developed a strategy to complete the IND-enabling studies necessary for at least one LADR™ drug, and worked with vendors on establishing approximate time lines and costs to reach first-in-human dosing, inclusive of manufacturing, and completion of pre-IND studies and FDA filings, With this important groundwork completed, we believe that management is well situated to rapidly advance our next-generation LADR™ assets as soon as funding or partnering is achieved, and is working diligently to obtain funding and/or partnering of the LADR™ assets. Management will continue to explore in parallel both partnered and non-partnered funding and development strategies for LADR™ with a goal of obtaining the least costly capital possible to enable value inflection milestones.
 
Partnering of Aldoxorubicin
 
On July 27, 2017, the Company entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with ImmunityBio, Inc, granting to ImmunityBio the exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize aldoxorubicin in all indications, and the Company is no longer directly working on the development of aldoxorubicin. As part of the license agreement, ImmunityBio made a strategic investment of $13 million in LadRx common stock at $6.60 per share (adjusted to reflect the Company’s 2017 reverse stock split), a premium of 92% to the market price on that date. In connection therewith, the Company also issued ImmunityBio a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock at $6.60, which expired on January 26, 2019. The Company is entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $343 million in potential milestone payments, contingent upon achievement of certain regulatory approvals and commercial milestones. The Company is also entitled to receive ascending double-digit royalties for net sales for soft tissue sarcomas and mid to high single digit royalties for other indications. There can be no assurance that ImmunityBio will achieve such milestones, approvals or sales with respect to aldoxorubicin.
 
ImmunityBio is conducting an open-label, randomized, Phase 2 study of a combination of immunotherapy, aldoxorubicin and standard-of-care chemotherapy versus standard-of-care chemotherapy alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients who have had 1 or 2 lines of treatment (Cohorts A and B) or 3 or greater lines of treatment (Cohort C).
 
In December 2022, Immunity Bio held a Type B meeting with the FDA to discuss the path for approval for this combination therapy for pancreatic cancer. The FDA advised ImmunityBio to conduct a randomized trial. This Phase 2, randomized, three-cohort, open-label study plans to evaluate the comparative efficacy and overall safety of standard-of-care chemotherapy versus low-dose chemotherapy in combination with PD-L1 t-haNK, Anktiva (N-803), and aldoxorubicin in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer (NCT04390399). Each treatment setting, as well as each first- and second-line or later maintenance treatment, will be evaluated independently as Cohorts A, B, and C, respectively, with Cohorts A and B having independent experimental and control arms. The primary objective of Cohorts A and B is progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST V1.1, and the objective of Cohort C is overall survival (OS). Secondary objectives include initial safety and additional efficacy measures, including overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, durability of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS)

In January 2023, ImmunityBio announced positive results in its non-randomized fully-enrolled metastatic pancreatic cancer study in third-line or greater subjects (QUILT 88) showing that the overall survival rate for patients continues to be double compared to historical survival rates after two or more prior lines of therapy. The results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI) conference in San Francisco January 19-21, 2023. The median OS in this highly advanced group of patients, up to seven lines (N=83) of treatment, was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.9, 6.4 months), exceeding the approximately 2- to 3-month historical median OS. In the third-line setting (N=41), the median OS in this group was 6.3 months (95% CI: 5.0, 7.2 months), more than doubling the historical OS. The baseline median CA 19-9 level (a marker of metastatic pancreatic disease) of the enrolled subjects (N=83) was very high at 4120 IU/ml, a significant increase from normal levels of 40 IU/ml. In subjects with CA 19-9 levels less than 4120 IU/ml (N=40), the median OS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.7,10.9).
 
Aldoxorubicin has received Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (“STS”). ODD provides several benefits including seven years of market exclusivity after approval, certain R&D related tax credits, and protocol assistance by the FDA. European regulators granted aldoxorubicin Orphan designation for STS which confers ten years of market exclusivity among other benefits.
 
ImmunityBio also lists ongoing clinical studies in glioblastoma; it is currently reviewing its options in STS.
 
Molecular Chaperone Assets (Orphayzme)
 
In 2011, LadRx sold the rights to arimoclomol and iroxanadine, based on molecular chaperone regulation technology, to Orphazyme A/S (“Orphazyme”, formerly Orphazyme ApS) in exchange for a one-time, upfront payment and the right to receive up to a total of $120 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain pre-specified regulatory and business milestones, as well as royalty payments based on a specified percentage of any net sales of products derived from arimoclomol (the “2011 Arimoclomol Agreement”). Orphazyme transferred its rights and obligations under the 2011 Arimoclomol Agreement to KemPharm Denmark A/S (“KemPharm”), a wholly owned subsidiary of KemPharm Inc., in May 2022 (the “KemPharm Transaction”).
 
In May 2021, Orphazyme announced that the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial for arimoclomol in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis did not meet its primary and secondary endpoints, reducing the maximum amount that LadRx currently has the right to receive under the 2011 Arimoclomol Agreement to approximately $100 million. Orphazyme also tested arimoclomol in Niemann-Pick disease Type C (“NPC”) and Gaucher disease, and following a Phase II/III trial submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application (‘NDA”) for the treatment of NPC with arimoclomol. On June 18, 2021, Orphazyme announced it had received a complete response letter (the “Complete Response Letter”) from the FDA indicating the need for additional data. In late October 2021, Orphazyme announced it held a Type A meeting with the FDA, at which the FDA recommended that Orphazyme submit additional data, information and analyses to address certain topics in the Complete Response Letter and engage in further interactions with the FDA to identify a pathway to resubmission. The FDA concurred with Orphazyme’s proposal to remove the cognition domain from the NPC Clinical Severity Scale (“NPCCSS”) endpoint, with the result that the primary endpoint is permitted to be recalculated using the 4- domain NPCCSS, subject to the submission of additional requested information which Orphazyme had publicly indicated that it intended to provide. To bolster the confirmatory evidence already submitted, the FDA affirmed that it would require additional in vivo or pharmacodynamic (PD)/pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Orphazyme planned to request a Type C Meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2022. Subject to discussions with the regulatory body, Orphazyme had publicly indicated that it planned to resubmit the NDA for arimoclomol in the second half of 2022.
 
Orphazyme had also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) with the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”). In February 2022, Orphazyme announced that although they had received positive feedback from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the EMA, they were notified by the CHMP of a negative trend vote on the MAA for arimoclomol for NPC following an oral explanation. In March 2022 Orphazyme removed its application with the EMA. Orphazyme had publicly indicated that it will assess its strategic options and provide an update to the market at the applicable time.

On May 31, 2022, Orphazyme announced that it had completed the sale of substantially all of its assets and business activities for cash consideration of $12.8 million and assumption of liabilities estimated to equal approximately $5.2 million to KemPharm, a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel treatments for rare central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases. As part of the KemPharm Transaction, all of Orphazyme’s obligations to LadRx under the 2011 Arimoclomol Agreement, including with regard to milestone payments and royalties on sales, were assumed by KemPharm. KemPharm is expected to continue the early access programs with arimoclomol, and to continue to pursue the potential approval of arimoclomol as a treatment option for NPC. KemPharm has indicated it plans on resubmitting the NDA for arimoclomol to the FDA in the third quarter of 2023. In February, 2023, KemPharm published positive data based on the recent completion of their four-year open-label safety trial that indicated arimoclomol may reduce the long-term progression of NPC. They plan on including these data as part of the updated NDA resubmission. It is also identifying a regulatory path forward with the EMA. KemPharm has recently re-branded to Zevra Therapeutics, Inc.
 
Innovive Acquisition Agreement
 
On September 19, 2008, we completed our merger acquisition of Innovive Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Innovive”), and its clinical-stage cancer product candidates, including aldoxorubicin and tamibarotene. Under the merger agreement by which we acquired Innovive, we agreed to pay the former Innovive stockholders up to approximately $18.3 million of future earnout merger consideration, subject to our achievement of specified net sales under the Innovive license agreements. The earnout merger consideration, if any, will be payable in shares of our common stock, subject to specified conditions, or, at our election, in cash or by a combination of shares of our common stock and cash. Our common stock will be valued for purposes of any future earnout merger consideration based upon the trading price of our common stock at the time the earnout merger consideration is paid. The earnout will be accrued if and when earned. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were due under this agreement.
Commercialization and Marketing
 
We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities or experience in marketing products.
 
We are searching for a development and commercialization partner or a financing for our LADR drug candidates and do not currently plan on commercializing them ourselves. Over the past two years, we have been unable to attract either a development and commercial partner or a financing for this endeavor; however, we are continuing to pursue all possibilities.
Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
We actively seek patent protection for our technologies, processes, uses, and ongoing improvements and consider our patents and other intellectual property to be critical to our business. We regularly evaluate the patentability of new inventions and improvements developed by us or our collaborators, and, whenever appropriate, will endeavor to file U.S. and international patent applications to protect these new inventions and improvements. We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have filed or licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the U.S. or any other country. There also is no assurance that any issued patents will be effective to prevent others from using our products or processes. It is also possible that any patents issued to us, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents and may acquire additional patents and proprietary rights relating to compounds, products or processes that may be competitive with ours.
 
In addition to patent protection, we attempt to protect our proprietary products, processes and other information by relying on trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and certain other persons who have access to such products, processes and information. Under the agreements, all inventions conceived by employees are our exclusive property, but there is no assurance that these agreements will afford significant protection against misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and confidential information.

As of December 31, 2022, we have three granted U.S. patents and twenty-five granted foreign patents, and two pending U.S. patent applications and thirty-eight pending foreign patent applications covering our LADRTM-related technology including LADR-7, LADR-8, LADR-9 and LADR-10. The un-extended patent term of patents that issue covering our LADRTM-related technology is between June 2036 and November 2038. We also have one pending US patent application and fourteen pending foreign patent applications covering our albumin companion diagnostic (ACDxTM). The un-extended patent term of patents that issue covering our ACDxTM is July 2039. The patents and patent applications covering our LADRTM-related technology, and ACDxTM are assigned to LadRx Corporation. In conjunction with our July 27, 2017, ImmunityBio licensing agreement, we granted ImmunityBio an exclusive license to all our aldoxorubicin-related patents, including the rights in three granted U.S. patents, twenty granted foreign patents and three pending foreign patent applications covering aldoxorubicin and related technologies. Our intellectual property holdings relating to aldoxorubicin, and related technologies include an exclusive license from Vergell Medical, S.A (“Vergell”). Patents and applications that cover pharmaceutical compositions comprising aldoxorubicin and their use in treating cancer (including glioblastoma) have un-extended patent terms expiring between December 2033 and June 2034.
 
LICENSE AGREEMENTS
 
Aldoxorubicin
 
We are the licensee of patent rights held by KTB Tumorforschungs GmbH (“KTB”) for the worldwide development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin under a license agreement dated April 17, 2006. In February 2017, we received notice that KTB had transferred and assigned its rights and obligations under the license to Vergell. The license is exclusive and applies to all products that may be subject to the licensed intellectual property in all fields of use. We may sublicense the intellectual property in our sole discretion. Pursuant to an amendment to the license agreement entered into in March 2014, we also have a non-exclusive worldwide license to any additional technology that is claimed or disclosed in the licensed patents and patent applications for use in the field of oncology.
 
Under the agreement, we must make payments to Vergell in the aggregate of up to $7.5 million upon meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones, and up to and including the product’s second final marketing approval. We also agreed to pay:
 

● | commercially reasonable royalties based on a percentage of net sales (as defined in the agreement); 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | a percentage of any non-royalty sub-licensing income (as defined in the agreement); and 
● | milestones of $1 million for each additional final marketing approval that we obtain. 

 
In the event that we must pay a third party in order to exercise our rights to the intellectual property under the agreement, we are entitled to deduct a percentage of those payments from the royalties due Vergell, up to an agreed upon cap.
 
Under the agreement with Vergell, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the research and development activities we determine are necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market aldoxorubicin in those countries that we determine are commercially feasible. Under the agreement, Vergell is to use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide us with access to suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of aldoxorubicin, on the same terms and conditions as may be provided to Vergell by those suppliers.
 
The agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis upon the expiration of the subject patent rights. We have the right to terminate the agreement on 30 days’ notice, provided we pay a cash penalty to Vergell. Vergell may terminate the agreement if we are in breach and the breach is not cured within a specified cure period, or if we fail to use diligent and commercial efforts to meet specified clinical milestones.

Molecular Chaperone Assets
 
The agreement relating to our worldwide rights to arimoclomol provides for our payment up to an aggregate of $3.65 million upon receipt of milestone payments from KemPharm.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our LADR™ technology platform and ultra-high potency albumin-bind drug conjugates provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research and product development capabilities, as well as greater financial, marketing and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours.
 
There are many companies developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) for the treatment of cancer and some that use the same classes of cytotoxic payloads as we are currently using. These include Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Seattle Genetics Inc. who market Adcetris®, and F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd./Genentech who market Kadcyla®. According to www.clinicaltrials.gov, many other major pharmaceutical companies, including Celgene and GlaxoSmithKline are testing an ADC in either on-going or currently enrolling clinical trials. Other companies have created or have programs to create cell-killing agents for attachment to antibodies or other targeting agents. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
In addition to ADCs, we face competition from other nanomedicine platforms developing targeted therapies, including platforms focused on nanoparticles and liposomes. Non-ADC therapies may be in development for the cancer types we or our partners elect to pursue. Further, these companies may also compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
Continuing development of conventional and targeted cytotoxins by large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies may result in new compounds that may compete with our product candidates. More recently, immuno-oncology therapies that stimulate the body’s own defense system to attack cancers are being developed by certain of these companies and some have been approved for use as cancer therapeutics. In the future, immuno-oncology agents including cell therapies, targeted therapies or cytotoxic treatments may compete with our product candidates. Other companies have created or have programs to create potent cell-killing agents for attachment to tumor targeting agents. These companies may compete with us for technology out-license arrangements.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our drug candidates achieve marketing approval, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products.
 
Many companies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with financial resources, research and development staffs, and facilities that may be substantially greater than those of ours or our strategic partners or licensees, are engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical products that could compete with our potential products. To the extent that we seek to acquire, through license or otherwise, existing or potential new products, we will be competing with numerous other companies, many of which will have substantially greater financial resources, large acquisition and research and development staffs that may give those companies a competitive advantage over us in identifying and evaluating these drug acquisition opportunities. Any products that we acquire will be competing with products marketed by companies that in many cases will have substantially greater marketing resources than we have. The industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and competitors may develop their products more rapidly and such products may be more effective than those currently under development or that may be developed in the future by our strategic partners or licensees. Competitive products for a number of the disease indications that we have targeted are currently being marketed by other parties, and additional competitive products are under development and may also include products currently under development that we are not aware of or products that may be developed in the future.

Government Regulation
 
Regulation of Pharmaceuticals in the United States
 
The U.S. and other developed countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. In the United States, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service (“PHS”) Act and other federal statutes and regulations, regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products and product candidates, and the parties engaged in the development, testing, manufacture, distribution, storage, marketing, labeling, advertising, and/or commercialization thereof (in addition to any other related activities) are subject to rigorous pre- and post-market requirements.
 
To obtain FDA approval for a new drug candidate, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting the candidate’s safety and efficacy for the intended indication(s), as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense and are inherently complex and uncertain. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we (and/or any current or future partners in development) may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our (and/or their) efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude the U.S. commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.
 
The process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves some or all of the following key steps:
 

● | completion of nonclinical studies, such as laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, performed in compliance with FDA regulations for good laboratory practices (“GLPs”) and other applicable regulations; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | design of a clinical protocol and its submission to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practices (“GCPs”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
● | submission of an NDA to the FDA along with payment of the application user fee and FDA acceptance of that NDA as a complete submission eligible for substantive review; 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”), in order to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
● | possible inspection of selected clinical study sites to confirm compliance with GCP requirements and data integrity; and 
● | FDA substantive review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, if applicable, which must occur prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the United States.

Preclinical Studies
 
After a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Preclinical tests intended for submission to the FDA to support the safety of a product candidate must be conducted in compliance with GLP regulations and the United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act, if applicable. A drug sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND will include one or more clinical protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated.
 
An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND. Occasionally, clinical holds are imposed due to manufacturing issues that may present safety issues for the clinical study subjects.
 
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
 
The clinical investigation of an investigational new drug is divided into three phases that typically are conducted sequentially but may overlap or be combined. The three phases are as follows:
 

● | Phase 1. Phase 1 includes initial clinical trials introducing an investigational new drug into humans and may be conducted in subjects with the target disease or healthy volunteers. These trials are designed to determine the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. Phase 2 includes the controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug candidate for a particular indication or indications in subjects with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of subjects. 
● | Phase 3. Phase 3 trials are typically large trials performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug candidate has been obtained. They are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling and product marketing approval. Phase 3 trials usually are conducted at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. 

 
A clinical trial may combine the elements of more than one phase and the FDA often requires more than one Phase 3 trial to support marketing approval of a product candidate. A company’s designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the FDA requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed.
 
A pivotal trial is a clinical trial that is believed to satisfy FDA requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s safety and efficacy such that it can be used, alone or with other pivotal or non-pivotal trials, to support regulatory approval. Generally, pivotal trials are Phase 3 trials, but they may be Phase 2 trials if the design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in an area of unmet medical need.

Clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product or therapeutic candidate. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, via a clinical hold, or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. An institutional review board (“IRB”), is responsible for ensuring that human subjects in clinical studies are protected from inappropriate study risks. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the trial until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. The IRB also may halt a study, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or if the investigational new drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
During the development of a new drug product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of “Phase 4” clinical trials.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other criteria, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the finished drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
Marketing Application Submission and FDA Review
 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications. An NDA includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information on the product candidate’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the FDA.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), each NDA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for prescription drug products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation, or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review.

Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months from receipt in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA for a drug that is not a new molecular entity, and six months from the receipt date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. As a result, the NDA review process can be very lengthy. Most innovative drug products (other than biological products) obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, commonly referred to as a traditional (or full) NDA.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs it receives to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, and may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing. If the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, whether it has an acceptable purity profile and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs. During its review of an NDA, the FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee of independent experts for a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA or its advisory committee may interpret data differently than the NDA sponsor interprets the same data. The FDA may also re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving the NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements and to assure the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. To ensure cGMP and GCP compliance by its employees and third-party contractors, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
 
The FDA may also require the submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or “REMS,” if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor must include a proposed REMS within its NDA submission.
 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities where the drug product or its API will be produced and the clinical trial sites, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or, in some cases, a complete response letter (“CRL”) that describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but that the application will not be approved in its present form. The deficiencies identified may be minor (e.g., requiring labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials and/or other time-consuming and expensive measures to generate the requisite safety and/or efficacy data). After receiving a CRL, an applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. FDA will issue a letter within 30 days of an NDA resubmission acknowledging receipt and informing the applicant as follows. For resubmissions deemed to be complete responses to all deficiencies identified in the CRL, such letter will contain FDA’s designation of the resubmission as Class 1 or Class 2 (based on the nature of information received therein) and the corresponding due date by which it will take action (2 months for Class 1 resubmissions and 6 months for Class 2). If FDA does not find the resubmission to be a complete response to all CRL deficiencies, the FDA will inform the applicant, and the FDA’s “review clock” will not start until a complete response is received.

Even if a drug product receives NDA approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages and/or subject to limitations, specific labeling requirements, and/or other conditions that must be met to lawfully market the product in the United States, any or all of which could restrict the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, and/or precautions be included in the product’s labeling. The FDA may also impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and/or testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Post-Approval Requirements for Prescription Drugs
 
Following approval of a new drug product, the manufacturer and the approved drug are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, and promotion and advertising requirements.
 
Promotional communications must be carefully crafted to ensure compliance with all applicable FDA regulations pertaining to prescription-drug marketing and labeling. In particular, prescription-drug advertisements must generally (1) not be false or misleading, (2) present a “fair balance” of information describing both the risks and benefits associated with the drug, (3) include facts that are “material” to the product’s advertised uses, and (4) include a “brief summary” that mentions every risk described in the product’s labeling. Further, where the intended use of a prescription drug differs from the intended use approved by FDA, as listed in the product’s approved NDA, FDA has asserted that the product is an unapproved “new drug” and taken enforcement action against sponsors for introducing such unapproved new drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the FDCA. This prohibited practice is also called “off-label” promotion. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, sponsors may not legally market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
To market an approved drug product for a new indication (i.e., beyond and/or differing from that set forth in the approved NDA), the sponsor must submit a new NDA (or NDA supplement), which, in many cases, will require the completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the product’s safety and efficacy in the new indication. There is no guarantee that FDA will approve an NDA seeking an expansion of an approved drug’s labeling and/or indications for use more quickly than an NDA involving a novel product (i.e., that has never been approved for any indication) or ever. Relatedly, if the sponsor (or a contractor, partner, or other affiliated party) makes any post-market modifications to an approved drug or the production thereof, including changes in labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, among other things, it may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement.
 
In addition, FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and some state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMPs and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process, specifications or container closure system for an approved drug product are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require, among other things, the investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and the imposition of reporting and documentation requirements upon the NDA sponsor and any third-party manufacturers involved in producing the approved drug product. Accordingly, both sponsors and manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort on systems relating to production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance and other aspects of quality control and quality assurance, and to ensure ongoing compliance with other statutory requirements of the FDCA. We anticipate that the products we may commercialize in the United States (if any) will be manufactured by our strategic partners (including licensees) or contractors (including any third parties who may be engaged by us or one of our partners to conduct any commercialization activities, as well as downstream subcontractors, as applicable) and we may, thus, be subject to enforcement action for any such third parties’ failures to comply with the applicable postmarket regulations or otherwise be adversely affected by any of our partners’ or contractors’ compliance issues.

The FDA may withdraw its approval for a drug product if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or unexpected problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies to assess new safety risks; or the imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS.
 
We and/or our present or future suppliers, contract manufacturers, and/or other affiliates involved in one or more of our current or future U.S. development and/or commercialization activities (if applicable) may not be able to comply with all FDA regulatory requirements. For example, we may believe that all clinical studies are being conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IND regulations and that none of our investigational products are being promoted with claims of safety and/or effectiveness for the intended use(s) for which they are under investigation, but the FDA may determine otherwise, which could subject us to enforcement action and/or delay or prevent the ultimate approval of our applicable product candidate(s). From a postmarket perspective, with regard to any products we may commercialize in the United States in the future, we may believe our manufacturing operations (including that of our partners and/or contractors, as applicable) are fully compliant with cGMPs and that all promotional communications disseminated by or on behalf of us are consistent with FDA’s prescription-drug marketing requirements, but the FDA may disagree and take enforcement action against us. Accordingly, we could be subject to a number of adverse enforcement actions and/or penalties in connection with any failure(s) to comply with the FDCA and/or its implementing regulations at any stage in development and/or commercialization (if applicable), including, but not limited to, the following:
 

● | fines, warning letters, untitled letters, public warnings, consumer advisories, “dear doctor” letters, and other similar publications or issuances; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs; 
● | seizure, detention, import alerts; 
● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; 
● | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or 
● | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information. 

 
We and our manufacturers and other partners in development and/or (future) commercialization, as applicable, also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We will also be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials.
 
We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the U.S.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
Healthcare Reform Measures
 
On March 23, 2010, former President Obama signed the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (P.L. 111-148) (the “ACA”) and on March 30, 2010, he signed the “Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act” (P.L. 111-152), collectively commonly referred to as the “Healthcare Reform Law.” The Healthcare Reform Law included a number of new rules regarding health insurance, the provision of healthcare, conditions to reimbursement for healthcare services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients, and other healthcare policy reforms. Through the law-making process, substantial changes have been and continue to be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the U.S., including changes made to extend medical benefits to certain Americans who lacked insurance coverage and to contain or reduce healthcare costs (such as by reducing or conditioning reimbursement amounts for healthcare services and drugs, and imposing additional taxes, fees, and rebate obligations on pharmaceutical and medical device companies). This legislation was one of the most comprehensive and significant reforms ever experienced by the U.S. in the healthcare industry and has significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. This legislation has impacted the scope of healthcare insurance and incentives for consumers and insurance companies, among others. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Law’s provisions were designed to encourage providers to find cost savings in their clinical operations. Pharmaceuticals represent a significant portion of the cost of providing care. This environment has caused changes in the purchasing habits of consumers and providers and resulted in specific attention to the pricing negotiation, product selection and utilization review surrounding pharmaceuticals. This attention may result in our current commercial products, products we may commercialize or promote in the future, and our therapeutic candidates, being chosen less frequently or the pricing being substantially lowered. At this stage, it is difficult to estimate the full extent of the direct or indirect impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on us.
 
These structural changes could entail further modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program), creation of government-sponsored healthcare insurance sources, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the U.S. could impact the reimbursement for prescribed drugs and pharmaceuticals, including our current commercial products, those we and our development or commercialization partners are currently developing or those that we may commercialize or promote in the future. If reimbursement for the products we currently commercialize or promote, any product we may commercialize or promote, or approved therapeutic candidates is substantially reduced or otherwise adversely affected in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Extending medical benefits to those who currently lack coverage will likely result in substantial costs to the U.S. federal government, which may force significant additional changes to the healthcare system in the U.S. Much of the funding for expanded healthcare coverage may be sought through cost savings. While some of these savings may come from realizing greater efficiencies in delivering care, improving the effectiveness of preventive care and enhancing the overall quality of care, much of the cost savings may come from reducing the cost of care and increased enforcement activities. Cost of care could be reduced further by decreasing the level of reimbursement for medical services or products (including our current commercial products, our development or commercialization partners or any product we may commercialize or promote, or those therapeutic candidates currently being developed by us), or by restricting coverage (and, thereby, utilization) of medical services or products. In either case, a reduction in the utilization of, or reimbursement for our current commercial products, any product we may commercialize or promote, or any therapeutic candidate, or for which we receive marketing approval in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Several states and private entities initially mounted legal challenges to the Healthcare Reform Law, in particular, the ACA, and they continue to litigate various aspects of the legislation. On July 26, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court generally upheld the provisions of the ACA at issue as constitutional. However, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the legislation improperly required the states to expand their Medicaid programs to cover more individuals. As a result, states have a choice as to whether they will expand the number of individuals covered by their respective state Medicaid programs. Some states have not expanded their Medicaid programs and have chosen to develop other cost-saving and coverage measures to provide care to currently uninsured individuals. Many of these efforts to date have included the institution of Medicaid-managed care programs. The manner in which these cost-saving and coverage measures are implemented could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations, particularly once we and/or any of our partners have products on the U.S. market, if ever.

Further, the healthcare regulatory environment has seen significant changes in recent years and is still in flux. Legislative initiatives to modify, limit, replace, or repeal the ACA and judicial challenges have continued. We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be impacted by legal challenges to the ACA or other aspects of the Healthcare Reform Law or other changes to the current laws and regulations. The financial impact of U.S. healthcare reform legislation over the next few years will depend on a number of factors, including the policies reflected in implementing regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for therapeutics affected by the legislation. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing coverage, reimbursement, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. In addition, third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies are often revised or interpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and any products we or our partners may commercialize in the future, as well as the prospects and/or viability of our product candidates.
 
During his time in office, former President Trump supported the repeal of all or portions of the ACA. President Trump also issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administration’s policy to seek the prompt repeal of the ACA and in which he directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. Congress has enacted legislation that repeals certain portions of the ACA, including but not limited to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017, which included a provision that eliminates the penalty under the ACA’s individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, as well as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, which, among other things, repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board (which was established by the ACA and was intended to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending).
 
Additionally, in December 2018, a district court in Texas held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the ACA is, therefore, invalid. On appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the holding on the individual mandate but remanded the case back to the lower court to reassess whether and how such holding affects the validity of the rest of the ACA. The Fifth Circuit’s decision on the individual mandate was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs (comprised of the state of Texas, as well as numerous other states and certain individuals) did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual mandate and, accordingly, vacated the Fifth Circuit’s decision and instructed the district court to dismiss the case. As a result, the ACA will remain in-effect in its current form for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot predict what additional challenges may arise in the future, the outcome thereof, or the impact any such actions may have on our business.
 
The Biden administration also introduced various measures in 2021 focusing on healthcare and drug pricing, in particular. For example, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021, and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On the legislative front, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law on March 11, 2021, which, in relevant part, eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source drugs and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. And, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order entitled, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a “Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices” that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. And, in November 2021, President Biden announced the “Prescription Drug Pricing Plan” as part of the Build Back Better Act (H.R. 5376) passed by the House of Representatives on November 19, 2021, which aims to lower prescription drug pricing by, among other things, allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs covered under Medicare Part D and Part B after the drugs have been on the market for a certain number of years and imposing tax penalties on drug manufacturers that refuse to negotiate pricing with Medicare or increase drug prices “faster than inflation.” If enacted, this bill could have a substantial impact on our business. In the coming years, additional legislative and regulatory changes could be made to governmental health programs that could significantly impact pharmaceutical companies and the success of our product candidates. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

There is uncertainty as to what healthcare programs and regulations may be implemented or changed at the federal and/or state level in the U.S. or the effect of any future legislation or regulation. Furthermore, we cannot predict what actions the Biden administration will implement in connection with the Health Reform Law. However, it is possible that such initiatives could have an adverse effect on our or our partners’ ability to obtain approval for and/or successfully commercialize products in the U.S. in the future.
 
Fraud and Abuse, Transparency, and Privacy
 
In the United States, we may be subject to various federal and state laws and regulations regarding fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, as well as industry standards and guidance, such as the codes issued by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (or “PhRMA Codes”), which some states reference or incorporate in their statutes and regulations. These laws, regulations, standards, and guidance may impact, among other things, our sales and marketing activities and our relationships with healthcare providers and patients. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include but are not limited to:

● | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claim Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors, that are false or fraudulent; 


◌ | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which imposes federal criminal and civil liability for executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the federal transparency laws, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and 
● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain pricing or payment information, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our current or future activities, policies, and/or arrangements could be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, the federal government has identified relationships between drug companies (and other medical-product manufacturers) and healthcare providers as particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse and, thus, our relationships may be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly once we have one or more products on the U.S. market, if ever. Further, many of the applicable healthcare laws and regulations are subject to varying and/or evolving interpretations, which makes achieving and maintaining consistent compliance more difficult. We may have to devote substantial costs, resources, and time to compliance efforts, particularly once one or more of our product candidates, or any other products to which we may obtain commercialization rights in the future, is marketed in the United States. If any of our past, current, or future operations and/or arrangements are found to be in violation of If our operations are found to be in violation of any healthcare laws or regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and/or administrative penalties; damages; fines; personal imprisonment; exclusion from government-funded programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid; additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity (or deferred prosecution or other similar) agreement with the applicable federal or state agency or agencies (such as the U.S. Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), or state attorneys general); and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any adverse enforcement action initiated against us based on actual or alleged violations of one or more of the healthcare laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such claims.
