Methods of Distribution
The Company’s products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers’ facilities.  The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world.  The Company owns or leases a significant portion of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges, towboats, and ocean-going vessels used to transport the Company’s products to its customers.
Concentration of Revenues by Product
The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods:

 | % of Revenues 
 | Year Ended December 31
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Soybeans | 16% | 17% | 17% 
Soybean Meal | 14% | 13% | 13% 
Corn | 12% | 10% | 10% 

Status of New Products
The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.  Acquisitions, especially in the Nutrition segment, expand the Company’s ability to serve customers’ evolving needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products. The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2019. 
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
A significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.  In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, EMEA, Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.  The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
The Company owns patents, trademarks, and licenses with a net book value of $269 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of patents, trademarks or licenses. 
Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers
Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.  There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements.  Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.  Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.  No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.  The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.  Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.

Competition
The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.  Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.
Research and Development 
Research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, net of reimbursements of government grants, was $141 million.
The Company’s laboratories and technical centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers globally, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients. The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development. Since that time, additional laboratories have been added, including food & beverages applications laboratories in Fort Collins, Colorado and Bergamo, Italy as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur, Illinois and Shanghai, China. In April 2018, the Company also opened its new enzyme development laboratory in Davis, California to advance the research and development of feed enzyme as well as enzymes for internal use.

The Company expanded its human health and nutrition portfolio in February 2017 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Biopolis SL (Biopolis), a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services. Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities for the Company's customers as well as for its internal use. Biopolis also has high through-put biological functionality testing capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals. In January 2018, the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed. In August 2018, the Company further expanded its probiotics business with the acquisition of Probiotics International Limited. 
ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in October 2016, continues to select high-potential, new product development projects from within its business units. The first internal venture funded project, a new sweetener, has been fully commercialized and is being sold in the United States by our Carbohydrate Solutions team. ADM Ventures has also made equity investments in three promising early-stage start-up companies and is looking at several others in which the Company may choose to invest.
The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products. Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis. The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. The Company’s project with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to a pilot production facility that opened in April 2018. This facility provides samples for customers as well as engineering data for a full-scale plant.

Environmental Compliance
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company spent $42 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.
There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.
A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including, but not limited to, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and its member states, and China. The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company’s business could be affected in the future by additional global, regional, national, and local regulation, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation, regulation or agreements. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or

agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.
Number of Employees
The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 31,600 at December 31, 2018 and 31,300 at December 31, 2017.  The net increase in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to acquisitions net of divestitures.
