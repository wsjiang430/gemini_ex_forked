Overview 
 We are dedicated to addressing the underlying causes of severe diseases by upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines. Using our proprietary TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) approach, we are developing antisense oligonucleotides (“ASOs”) to selectively restore protein levels. Our first compound, STK-001, is in clinical testing for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Dravet syndrome is characterized by frequent, prolonged and refractory seizures beginning within the first year of life. The disease is classified as a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy due to the developmental delays and cognitive impairment associated with it.
 Dravet syndrome is one of many diseases caused by a haploinsufficiency, in which a loss of approximately 50% of normal protein levels leads to disease. We are also pursuing treatment for a second haploinsufficient disease, autosomal dominant optic atrophy (“ADOA”), the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. Our initial focus is haploinsufficiencies and diseases of the central nervous system and the eye, although proof of concept has been demonstrated in other organs, tissues, and systems, supporting our belief in the broad potential for our proprietary approach.
 TANGO is based on the pioneering work conducted on pre-mRNA splicing and ASOs in the laboratory of one of our co-founders, Adrian R. Krainer, Ph.D., of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York (“CSHL”). Inspired by the clinical success of SPINRAZA (nusinersen), an ASO medicine for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy that was co-invented by Professor Krainer, our company was founded to develop a general antisense approach to upregulate protein expression. 
 Our executive management team has extensive collective expertise in human genetics and modulation of RNA processes using ASOs, as well as a track record of success in rare disease drug development. Our executive team and co-founders have been previously involved with other companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of many treatments for rare diseases, including Sarepta’s Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Biogen’s SPINRAZA. Our scientific and clinical advisory boards are comprised of leading experts in the fields of human genetics, pre-mRNA splicing and ASOs, and neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. Their involvement in both academic research and clinical practice allows us to gain proprietary and early insight into emerging biology and clinical practice that informs our business strategy. 
 Our strategy 
 We are using our proprietary RNA therapeutics platform to create ASOs for the treatment of severe diseases. The critical components of our strategy include: 
  
• | Rapidly advance our lead program, STK-001, to clinical proof-of-concept, approval and commercialization. Phase 1/2a trials of STK-001 are ongoing in the United States (MONARCH) evaluating children and adolescents ages 2 to 18 with Dravet syndrome and in the United Kingdom (ADMIRAL) evaluating children and adolescents ages 2 to up to 18 with Dravet syndrome. We are leveraging previously-validated ASO chemistry, a modality that has been successfully utilized for other diseases, a well-defined patient population based on routine genetic testing and learnings from approved drugs for the treatment of Dravet syndrome to inform the clinical and regulatory pathways for STK-001 and minimize potential safety concerns and development risk. We believe STK-001 has the potential to significantly reduce both the occurrence and frequency of seizures and also non-seizure comorbidities. We plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory pathways if the data are appropriate. If approved, we intend to leverage a lean, targeted internal commercial organization to bring STK-001 to patients.

• | Advance STK-002 to the clinic, for the potential treatment of ADOA. STK-002 is a proprietary ASO in preclinical development for the treatment of ADOA, the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. ADOA represents a second haploinsufficiency disease addressed by TANGO and our first treatment for diseases of the eye. STK-002 is designed to upregulate OPA1 protein expression by leveraging the non-mutant (wild-type) copy of the OPA1 gene. We have submitted a Clinical Trial Authorisation (“CTA”) in the United Kingdom and, subject to approval by the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”), we expect to begin a Phase 1/2 trial for STK-002 in 2024.

• | Expand our pipeline through internal discovery and collaboration to fully exploit the potential of our proprietary platform (TANGO). We have built a target discovery process utilizing proprietary bioinformatics algorithms and extensive in-house expertise in whole transcriptome RNA sequencing to rapidly and systematically identify

diseases that we believe can be addressed using our platform. We are also advancing additional early programs focused on multiple targets, including haploinsufficiency diseases of the central nervous system (the “CNS”) and eye. In January 2022, we announced a collaboration with Acadia Pharmaceuticals to pursue RNA-based treatments for severe and rare genetic neurodevelopmental diseases of the CNS. The collaboration combines our TANGO research platform with Acadia’s expertise in neurology drug development and commercialization. Longer-term, we believe that our ASOs may have the potential to upregulate non-mutated genes in biological pathways to treat diseases or conditions that are caused by multiple genes or are multifactorial, such as autoimmune diseases, aging and cancer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain broad commercial rights to our product candidates where we believe we can realize maximum value. We intend to build a fully integrated biotechnology company and independently pursue the development and commercialization of our key product candidates, if approved. We own commercial rights to our technologies and our lead product candidates, STK-001 and STK-002. As we continue to advance our programs, we may pursue strategic collaborations to share risk and upside in programs with higher inherent biology risk, larger clinical trial sizes or longer or more complex clinical, regulatory or commercial paths. Our current collaboration with Acadia is an example of where we believe that the development of treatments for severe and rare genetic neurodevelopmental diseases of the CNS is well served by a strategic collaboration.

• | Continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio. We have an intellectual property estate that includes multi-national allowed and pending claims for the TANGO mechanisms, as well as multi-national pending claims relating to compositions of matter of oligonucleotides designed to target specific TANGO elements in genes for many genetic diseases that we believe are amenable to upregulation of target protein expression using TANGO. Our proprietary position is reinforced by additional technical know-how and trade secrets. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy as we identify new targets amenable to TANGO, and we will file additional patent applications as appropriate.

 Our proprietary RNA therapeutics platform (TANGO) 
 TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) is our proprietary research platform. Our initial applications for this technology are diseases in which one copy of a gene functions normally and the other is mutated, also called haploinsufficiencies. In these cases, the mutated gene does not produce its share of protein, so the body does not function normally. Using the TANGO approach and a deep understanding of RNA science, Stoke researchers design ASOs that bind to pre-mRNA and help the target genes produce more protein. TANGO aims to restore missing proteins by increasing – or stoking – protein output from healthy genes, thus compensating for the non-functioning copy of the gene.
 
TANGO exploits unique mechanisms for modulation of splicing to prevent the synthesis of naturally occurring non-productive mRNA and increase the synthesis of productive mRNA, resulting in increased production of functional protein. 
 
Human cells naturally regulate protein production to maintain health. Pre-mRNA splicing, including alternative splicing, is an important mechanism used to regulate how much protein and which protein variant is produced. During splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together to generate the mRNA template that carries the code to synthesize proteins. More than one third of alternative splicing events in mammals do not produce functional proteins and lead to mRNA degradation through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (“NMD”). TANGO ASOs act at the pre-mRNA level and prevent non-productive alternative splicing so that the body produces more protein-coding mRNA and thus more protein. This approach is particularly applicable to diseases that are caused by insufficient protein production.
 
In July 2020, we published data in the journal Nature Communications that support our proprietary approach to precisely upregulate protein expression using TANGO ASOs. To evaluate the approach broadly, Stoke researchers selected four gene targets that vary in type and abundance of non-productive splicing events, gene size and protein function: PCCA (propionic acidemia); SYNGAP1 (autosomal dominant mental retardation 5); CD274 (autoimmune diseases, including uveitis); and SCN1A (Dravet syndrome). Stoke researchers designed TANGO ASOs to target the non-productive splicing events in these genes and their activity was evaluated. Dose-dependent reductions of non-productive mRNA were observed to lead to increases in both productive mRNA and protein levels for each of the target genes. 
 
Treatment of autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases with TANGO ASOs
 We are initially focused on applying the transformative potential of our platform to developing precision medicines for autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies, or disorders in which only one allele of a gene is mutated, resulting in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. 
 2

Exhibits 1 and 2 shown below illustrate the TANGO mechanism for increasing protein synthesis in a prospective patient with a haploinsufficiency. To date, we have demonstrated this TANGO mechanism in preclinical models of haploinsufficiencies. Exhibit 1 illustrates the prospective patient with a haploinsufficiency possessing one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. The mutant allele is translated into non-functional protein and results in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. Exhibit 2 illustrates treatment with our ASO would prevent the synthesis of naturally occurring non-productive mRNA and would increase the synthesis of productive mRNA, thereby restoring the target protein to near normal levels. Our preclinical studies show that any increase in mutant mRNA would have no effect on the net protein level.

------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------



TANGO mechanisms of action 
 Our ASOs are specifically designed to bind to a desired RNA sequence inside the nuclei of patients’ cells to prevent the occurrence of non-productive splicing. By doing so, our ASOs decrease the amount of non-productive mRNA and increase the level of productive mRNA, leading to the generation of more protein. TANGO operates in a mutation-independent manner, given it utilizes one wild-type allele, and does not alter protein coding splicing isoforms. The net effect is increased expression of functional protein from the wild-type allele. 
 One category of non-productive splicing events amenable to TANGO is alternative splicing that leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or NMD, of the resulting mRNA. An example of a NMD event is a NMD exon, which is found in over 25% of gene transcripts. NMD exons are part of the wild-type sequence of the genes. In some cases, NMD exons are part of normal gene regulation. Non-productive mRNA, which includes these NMD exons, is degraded in the cytoplasm of the cell by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and is not translated into protein. Our ASOs bind to the pre-mRNA and redirect the splicing machinery to prevent inclusion of the NMD exon. This splice-switching decreases non-productive mRNA and increases productive mRNA, which is translated into increased protein expression from the wild-type allele. In contrast to current exon skipping therapies, which remove a coding exon and result in a truncated protein, our TANGO mechanism skips out a non-coding NMD exon and yields a full-length functional protein. Our lead product candidates, STK-001 and STK-002, target an NMD exon and the general mechanism is shown in exhibits 3 and 4 below, with the left panel showing the non-productive mRNA failing to be translated into protein and the right panel showing our ASOs binding to the pre-mRNA and redirecting the splicing machinery.

Advantages of TANGO 
 We believe TANGO may have several key advantages, including: 
  
• | Ability to address the underlying genetic cause of the disease. We utilize TANGO to design ASOs to precisely upregulate protein expression, thereby addressing the underlying cause of the disease in addition to the symptoms of the disease. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Applicability is mutation-independent. Our ASOs upregulate expression of the wild-type allele, meaning the TANGO mechanism does not rely on targeting a specific mutation. Given this, we believe our therapies are well-suited for diseases caused by multiple mutations in a single gene, such as many haploinsufficiencies, and provide a single-drug approach that can address the full spectrum of loss-of-function mutations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility across small and large gene targets encoding intracellular and extracellular proteins. Our ASOs upregulate protein expression regardless of gene size and are not constrained to smaller gene targets. We believe our therapies also have the flexibility to address genes encoding intracellular as well as extracellular proteins. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | No observed unwanted off-target effects. Our ASOs do not create detectable changes at the DNA level and make no detectable irreversible modifications to a patient’s genome. The activities of our ASOs are inherently tissue-specific. TANGO-mediated upregulation of protein expression only occurs where the gene is being naturally transcribed, limiting the likelihood of expression in non-native tissues. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ability to control dose level and duration. Our ASOs provide the ability for dose titration, thereby allowing for dose-dependent and reversible control of level and duration of protein expression. The ability to titrate dosage provides us with flexibility to address a variety of tissue types, and potentially enables us to deliver the right dose, at the right location, for each indication. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utility across wide array of diseases and tissue types. We believe that ASO delivery to the CNS, eye, kidney and liver is well-established, providing us the potential to address a broad range of severe diseases. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fixed dose, rather than weight-based dosing. We have observed that while the quantity of non-productive mRNA can vary across tissue types for a gene, it remains constant across individuals. As a result, for CNS and eye targets, the dose of our ASOs should not require adjustment between patients to be effective. We believe that a fixed dose across all ages in these targets may lessen reimbursement hurdles associated with a weight-adjusted dose pricing model. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Favorable dosing regimen. We believe our ASOs may require as few as two to three administrations per year for the CNS and as infrequent as once per year for the eye and will generally involve relatively low doses, which would translate to simplified use and an improved safety profile due to reduced systemic exposure. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Simple and scalable manufacturing. Our novel ASOs are synthesized by highly scalable, solid-phase chemical synthesis and we leverage a well-established contract manufacturing base. We believe the manufacturing requirements for our ASOs are much simpler, more scalable and more cost-effective than gene therapy and gene editing. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our approach 
 We employ a systematic and capital-efficient approach to develop ASOs for genetically defined patient populations. We rely on our proprietary database to identify novel drug targets and corroborate these findings with existing knowledge to improve our probability of success in the clinic. We believe that leveraging our proprietary database and focusing on our core competencies of target identification and clinical and regulatory execution will allow us to reduce the time, cost and risks of drug development. 
 Target identification 
 We continue to make significant investments in our infrastructure to accelerate the pace and scale of target identification. We have built a significant bioinformatics capability, which includes proprietary bioinformatics algorithms and extensive in-house expertise in whole transcriptome RNA sequencing, also referred to as RNAseq. RNAseq uses next-generation sequencing to determine the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample. We leverage large internal datasets of RNAseq from key tissues known to be addressable with antisense, such as the CNS, eye, liver and kidney, that are purpose-built to enhance the capture of non-productive events. 
 We employ machine learning to iteratively refine our search and scoring criteria for the most addressable non-productive mRNA elements based on internal target validation and hit identification data. Our technology is amenable to a large number of mutations and can thereby potentially provide a single-drug approach for diseases that are caused by many loss-of-function mutations in a single gene. We have identified approximately 1,200 monogenic, or single gene, diseases containing at least one NMD-inducing nonproductive event, which we believe may be amenable to TANGO. We believe our approach is highly predictive and enables rapid and systematic identification of those targets that are most likely to have clinical relevance, thereby increasing the probability for clinical success and accelerating the expansion of our emerging pipeline. 
 Hit identification 
 Once a TANGO target is validated in cells and tissues that are relevant to the disease, we employ cell lines to rapidly screen for hit ASOs that can increase the target protein expression by specifically preventing the occurrence of the non-productive event in the target mRNA. ASO arrays utilize clinically translatable previously-validated ASO chemistries, such as 2’ methoxyethyl phosphorothioate and PMO. Hit compounds are evaluated in vivo to identify lead ASOs that possess suitable efficacy and safety to merit preclinical development. Lead ASOs are subsequently evaluated in animal disease models or ex vivo disease model systems. 
 Lead evaluation and prioritization 
 After we have identified lead compounds, we evaluate and prioritize the advancement of new development candidates based on both program-specific and portfolio-wide considerations. Program-specific criteria include, among other relevant factors, the severity of the unmet medical need, the likelihood of therapeutic utility, the feasibility of clinical development, the costs of development and the commercial opportunity. Portfolio-wide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform, thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs. We believe that the learnings from our lead Dravet syndrome program will significantly reduce the uncertainty of development of subsequent programs in our pipeline, particularly those targeting the CNS. 
 Clinical trial and regulatory execution 
 We employ a multi-pronged approach to bring new product candidates forward as rapidly as possible. Our approach leverages previously-validated ASO chemistry and a modality that has been successfully utilized for other diseases, to minimize potential safety concerns and development risk. We have two ongoing Phase 1/2a open-label studies of STK-001 for Dravet syndrome, MONARCH in the United States and ADMIRAL in the United Kingdom, each with a design and endpoints common to the trials for approved anti-seizure medications (“ASMs”).

Commercialization 
 We intend to retain broad commercial rights and independently bring our therapies to patients through a lean, targeted internal commercial organization where we believe we can realize maximum value. To do this, we are focused on ensuring that we can effectively identify and access those patients who may benefit from our product candidates. We target diseases in which genetic testing is routinely performed, thereby shortening the diagnostic odyssey and enabling rapid identification of patients who harbor the relevant genetic mutations. We have partnered with Invitae, a leading genetic information company, to provide genetic testing for pediatric epilepsy at no cost to patient. Lastly, to maximize patient access, we aim to leverage an established network of academic and tertiary centers with extensive experience with analogous drug administration. 
 Therapeutic focus and product candidates 
 We believe our ASOs can be applied to treat a wide range of severe diseases, and we have carefully designed and prioritized our pipeline strategy to maximize this opportunity. We are focused on applying the transformative potential of our TANGO platform to developing medicines for patients with diseases where the genetic abnormality is known and is found in a single gene. We therefore know for a given disease precisely which gene will need to be upregulated, thus mitigating against the uncertainty of the disease biology. We are currently focused on developing product candidates to treat autosomal dominant haploinsufficiency diseases, or disorders in which one copy of a gene is mutated and results in approximately 50% of normal protein expression. Within haploinsufficiencies, we are prioritizing genetic diseases of the CNS and the eye for our near-term development efforts. 
 Our Development Programs
 Our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of biologics, RNA splicing, and antisense oligonucleotide chemistry has enabled us to build a pipeline of programs targeting the underlying cause of severe diseases. Exhibit 5 below represents a summary of our programs, which are focused on genetic diseases of the CNS and eye.

STK-001 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome 
 STK-001 is an investigational new medicine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome currently being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. We believe that STK-001 has the potential to be the first disease-modifying therapy to address the genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. STK-001 is designed to upregulate Nav1.1 protein expression by leveraging the non-mutant (wild-type) copy of the SCN1A gene to restore physiological Nav1.1 protein levels, thereby reducing both occurrence of seizures and significant non-seizure comorbidities.
 Disease Overview
 Dravet syndrome is one of the most severe genetic epilepsies and affects approximately 6.4 in 100,000 people worldwide, including 5-5.5 in 100,000 people who possess a mutation in the SCN1A gene, according to a 2018 market research report commissioned by us and prepared by Health Advances, LLC, or the Health Advances Report. The disease is caused by a pathogenic mutation or deletion of the SCN1A gene in approximately 85% of patients. At least 1,700 different de novo mutations in the SCN1A gene have been identified to date in Dravet syndrome patients, including single nucleotide substitutions, small insertions or deletions and even whole gene deletions. SCN1A codes for the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, or Nav1.1 protein, an ion channel that is essential for the generation and propagation of action potentials. More than 95% of the disease-causing mutations of SCN1A cause loss-of-function, resulting in haploinsufficiency (approximately 50% reduction) of the Nav1.1 protein in select neurons in the brain. This loss of Nav1.1 channels in inhibitory interneurons and other nerve cells results in Dravet syndrome. 
 Dravet syndrome is characterized by multiple seizure types and may progress to status epilepticus or prolonged seizures lasting more than five minutes that require immediate intervention. Patients typically experience their first seizure before 12 months of age. More than 90% of patients suffer from at least one non-seizure comorbidity, including severe intellectual and developmental disabilities, motor and speech impairment, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and behavioral difficulties. Neurologic function and cognition are usually normal in children with Dravet syndrome up to two years of age. However, nearly all Dravet syndrome patients exhibit intellectual impairment by the age of four, ranging from minor learning difficulty to global developmental delay. The time between one year and eight years of age is a critical period for intervention. After eight years of age, nearly all Dravet syndrome patients exhibit evidence of substantial developmental delay. The symptoms of the disease result in remarkably low quality of life and shortened life expectancy, and as a result impose an immense burden on individuals and families. 
 The cognitive impairment in Dravet syndrome is not purely a consequence of seizures. Patients with few seizures have been observed to possess severe encephalopathy, and conversely patients with frequent seizures have been observed to exhibit relatively minimal cognitive decline. In addition, there does not appear to be a correlation between cognitive outcome and SCN1A mutation type, whether a missense or truncating mutation. 
 Importantly, patients with Dravet syndrome have an increased risk of premature death, primarily due to SUDEP, or Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy. Dravet syndrome patients have the highest SUDEP rate of any epilepsy. An analysis of mortality in the Epilepsy Genetics Research Program demonstrated a Dravet syndrome-specific mortality rate of 15.84 per 1,000 patient years. SUDEP was the most common cause of premature death among Dravet syndrome patients (59%), equating to a Dravet syndrome-specific SUDEP rate of 9.32 per 1,000 patient-years. This is nearly twice the rate for adults with refractory epilepsy. 
 Patients with Dravet syndrome are often diagnosed by three years of age, and neither patient gender nor family history of seizures is associated with risk of Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome occurs worldwide and is not concentrated in any particular geographic area or ethnic group. Early diagnosis is driven by heightened awareness of Dravet syndrome and other genetic epilepsy disorders as well as an emerging consensus amongst epilepsy specialists that early diagnosis is cost-effective and beneficial for prognosis. Among pediatric Dravet syndrome patients, approximately 90% in North America and Europe undergo genetic testing as part of their diagnostic work-up, according to a 2021 market research report commissioned by Stoke and prepared by Recon Strategy, or the Recon Strategy report. 
 The incidence of Dravet syndrome is approximately 64 per million births, which translates to an overall prevalence of approximately 35,000 patients across the United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, with approximately 16,000 patients in the United States. 
 7

Current treatments 
 Current treatments for Dravet syndrome only address the occurrence of seizures, not the underlying cause, and according to a 2017 study as published in the Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology Journal, more than 90% of Dravet syndrome patients still report suffering from incomplete seizure control with existing ASM regimens. As a result, the current treatment strategy involves the use of multiple ASMs, including combinations of cannabidiol, stiripentol, clobazam, valproate, topiramate and others. Patients are typically treated with two to four drugs administered concomitantly, and in most cases the relief provided by polytherapy is insufficient. 
 Cannabidiol (Epidiolex), fenfluramine (Fintepla) and stiripentol (Diacomit) are currently the only FDA-approved ASMs for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. None of these approved ASMs address the significant non-seizure comorbidities. Moreover, patients are still likely to be affected by non-seizure comorbidities and may develop tolerance to these ASMs over time. 
 Patients with Dravet syndrome need a novel therapeutic that addresses the genetic basis of the disease and treats the large number of seizures and multiple seizure types that persist despite treatment with existing therapy. Importantly, additional therapy options are needed to address the disabling comorbidities that occur with Dravet syndrome. If STK-001 is approved by the FDA, we believe our precision medicine approach may have a profound impact on individuals and families. 
 Preclinical data 
 We have generated compelling preclinical data that demonstrate proof-of-mechanism for STK-001. Our initial target engagement, pharmacology and efficacy studies were performed in mice, including both wild-type and a Dravet syndrome mouse model. The targeted non-productive splicing event in SCN1A is highly conserved across multiple species, including mouse, non-human primates and humans. The target sequence for STK-001 is also identical across species. 
 
We evaluated STK-001 pharmacology and efficacy in transgenic mice with a heterozygous deletion of Scn1a. This model was created by introducing a targeted deletion in the first coding exon of the Scn1a gene; these mice exhibit many aspects of the Dravet syndrome phenotype including seizures and premature lethality.

Neonate (postnatal day two) Dravet syndrome mice and wild-type littermate controls were administered a single dose of either placebo (consisting of a phosphate-buffered solution), or 20 µg of STK-001 (n=~50/group) by intracerebroventricular injection. Animals from each group were monitored through day 90. Brains were collected from cohorts of these animals at approximately 7 weeks after dosing (placebo: n=11 wild-type mice, n=4 Dravet syndrome mice; STK-001: n=9 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice) and 14 weeks after dosing (placebo: n=10 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice; STK-001: n=10 wild-type mice, n=10 Dravet syndrome mice). Notably, a single injection of STK-001 restored Nav1.1 protein in Dravet syndrome mice to levels that are near those of the wild-type mice at both 7 and 14 weeks as shown in exhibit 6. These data demonstrate that STK-001 has an impact on Nav1.1 protein expression and we believe this may translate to a favorable dosing regimen in humans.

In addition to an increase in the Nav1.1 protein, the administration of a single dose of 20 µg of STK-001 in neonate Dravet syndrome mice (postnatal day two) resulted in a significant reduction in premature mortality. Treatment with STK-001 resulted in 97% survival of Dravet syndrome mice for the 90-day post-natal observation period (survival of 33 out of 34 mice was observed in the STK-001 Dravet syndrome mouse group) compared with 23% survival of placebo-treated mice (survival of 14 out of 62 mice). This is illustrated in exhibit 7.

 Further preclinical studies of STK-001 have shown significant reductions in seizure frequency in a mouse model of Dravet syndrome (DS). Data from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings showed 76% (16/21) of DS mice treated with STK-001 were seizure free compared to 48% (10/21) that were treated with a placebo. An 80% reduction in the average number of spontaneous seizures (3 seizures vs 16 seizures) was also observed among treated DS mice compared to placebo. EEG is a highly sensitive measure of seizure activity, which enables the detection of seizures that may not be otherwise visible. These data are published in Han et al., Science Trans. Med, 2020.
 
Analyses were also performed in silico to understand the specificity of STK-001. We evaluated STK-001 via bioinformatic analysis against all annotated protein-coding genes to predict potential off-target activities. Results showed no perfect 18- to 16-nucleotide match for STK-001 anywhere in the transcriptome other than SCN1A pre-mRNA, indicating that STK-001 recognizes a unique sequence in the human transcriptome and should possess minimal off-target bindings. 
 10

Further supporting our specificity analysis, we also evaluated brain samples of wild-type neonate mice to ensure that STK-001 does not alter levels of other channels in the highly homologous SCN family. Importantly, the mRNA levels of closely related ion channels were not altered in the mouse brain five days after administration of 10 µg of STK-001 (n=2/group placebo, n=4/group STK-001), as shown in the figure below. Similar analysis was performed in wild-type and Dravet syndrome mice treated with 20 µg of STK-001 at 7 and 14 weeks after dosing. As illustrated in exhibit 8, STK-001 treated samples showed an increase in expression of the SCN1A gene, but not any of the other SCN family members. These biological studies demonstrate that STK-001 is highly specific for SCN1A among the highly homologous family of sodium channel genes, limiting the likelihood of off-target activities.

We also investigated the pharmacology, distribution and tolerability of STK-001 in a study with cynomolgus monkeys. As a pilot experiment, this study was not required to be performed under Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP. Pre-pubescent monkeys (age 2-2.5 years old) were administered a single dose of STK-001 (n=3/group; 4 groups dosed) or control solution (n=2/group; 2 groups dosed) by intrathecal injection at a dose range that we believe coincides with the estimated therapeutic dose range and stays below the maximum tolerated dose based on tolerability in mice and published data for molecules of similar chemistry. The animals were sacrificed at 3 days (n=8) and 29 days (n=8) after dosing. An increase in NaV1.1 levels was observed ranging from 1.1-fold to 2.0-fold, compared to the control group, varying by the anatomical region, dose and day of necropsy, with the greatest changes observed in the cerebral cortex. The increase in Nav1.1 was also correlated with the presence of STK-001 in brain tissue. Additionally, all doses tested showed no drug-related toxicities, including no changes in platelet counts or hepatic function, no clinical signs or symptoms over the 28-day period after administration and no abnormal histopathology. 
 Single dose GLP toxicology studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys, that characterized the pharmacology, exposure and tolerability of STK-001 were included in the investigational new drug application (the “IND”) that was submitted to the FDA in late 2019. Additional multiple dose GLP toxicology data have subsequently been submitted to the FDA and the MHRA (UK regulatory agency) to support multiple dosing in the clinic.  
 Clinical program and data 
 We designed our lead product candidate, STK-001, to treat Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. This program draws on a well-defined patient population based on routine genetic testing and learnings from drugs approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome to inform the clinical and regulatory pathways for STK-001.

MONARCH and ADMIRAL Phase 1/2a Studies
 We have two ongoing Phase 1/2a open-label studies of STK-001, MONARCH in the United States and ADMIRAL in the United Kingdom. The MONARCH study is designed to evaluate single and multiple ascending dose levels of STK-001 administered intrathecally in children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome. Patients are eligible for the trial if they are between the ages of 2 to 18, have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and have evidence of a pathogenic genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene. Requiring an SCN1A mutation for trial enrollment allows for a clear and definitive etiologic diagnosis, a more homogeneous patient population and tailored treatment based on a precision medicine approach. Eligible patients will also have failed at least two epilepsy treatments in the past and currently be taking at least one ASM. All medications and interventions will remain unchanged throughout the trials, which will allow for assessment of STK-001 with a variety of ASMs. 
 The primary objectives are the assessment of the safety and tolerability of STK-001, as well as to characterize blood pharmacokinetics (“PK”) and cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) exposure levels. A secondary objective is to assess the efficacy of STK-001 as an adjunctive ASM treatment with respect to the percent change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency over a 12-week treatment period. We are measuring non-seizure aspects of the disease, such as quality of life as secondary endpoints. 
 These endpoints as well as other exploratory endpoints will be informed based on our two-year observational study (BUTTERFLY). Enrollment in BUTTERFLY is complete and the study is ongoing. BUTTERFLY is designed to evaluate seizure frequency and non-seizure comorbidities associated with the disease, including motor and speech impairment, intellectual and developmental disabilities, behavioral deficits and abnormal sleep patterns. Data from the study will support clinical development plans for STK-001.  Initial data from BUTTERFLY suggest that commonly used cognition assessments, BSID-III (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition), and WPPSI-IV (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition) may be useful for clinical studies assessing neurodevelopment and adaptive behavior in patients with Dravet syndrome. All three assessments showed relatively low intra-patient variability. Small improvements in receptive communication over twelve months were observed in patients and appear to be driven by younger patients, but otherwise no significant change from baseline to twelve months after baseline assessments was observed in the assessments across all other scales.
 In March 2020, we announced the FDA had placed a partial clinical hold on doses of STK-001 above 20mg in the MONARCH study, pending additional preclinical testing to determine the safety profile of doses higher than the current no observed adverse effect level (“NOAEL”). When intrathecal doses above the NOAEL were administered to non-human primates (“NHPs”), adverse hind limb paresis was observed. This finding is known to occur following intrathecal delivery of ASOs to NHPs and is not known to translate to the human experience. When extremely high dose levels were administered, acute convulsions were observed immediately following STK-001 administration. The dose levels were well above the range of corresponding human doses that would ever be administered in the clinic and were delivered in a formulation that was at a higher concentration than would be administered in the clinic. There is no apparent correlation of these acute adverse events with the mechanism of action of STK-001. 
 Since March 2020, the FDA has agreed to allow us to add additional higher dose levels to the MONARCH study. The study is currently permitted to evaluate single doses (10mg, 20mg, 30mg or  45mg) and multiple doses administered monthly for three months (20mg, 30mg or 45mg). Dosing above 45mg in this study remains on FDA partial clinical hold. 
 The ADMIRAL study is a Phase 1/2a open-label study of children and adolescents ages 2 to <18 who have an established diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and have evidence of a genetic mutation in the SCN1A gene. The primary objectives for the study are to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of STK-001 up to 70mg, as well as to determine the pharmacokinetics in plasma and exposure in cerebrospinal fluid. A secondary objective is to assess the effect of multiple doses of STK-001 as an adjunctive antiepileptic treatment with respect to the percentage change from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency over a 24-week treatment period. We are measuring non-seizure aspects of the disease, such as overall clinical status and quality of life, as secondary endpoints.
 In the second half of 2021, we announced positive interim safety, PK, CSF exposure, and efficacy data from the MONARCH study based on data from patients who were treated in the 20mg MAD dose cohort, most of whom had received three monthly doses of STK-001, or the single 10mg, 20mg or 30mg dose cohorts. Key findings from the interim analysis included that single doses of STK-001 up to 30mg, and three 20mg doses of STK-001 given every four weeks were found to be well tolerated. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were headache, vomiting, seizure, irritability, and back pain. Additionally, 70.6% (12 of 17) patients treated with single doses (10mg, 20mg, 30mg) or multiple 
 12

doses (20mg) of STK-001, and all patients ages 2-12 (7 of 7), experienced a reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency measured from Day 29 to Day 84 after receiving their first dose of STK-001.
 In November and December 2022, we announced additional positive interim safety, PK, CSF exposure and efficacy data from the MONARCH and ADMIRAL studies, which, along with other data, was presented at the American Epilepsy Society (AES) 2022 Annual Meeting. The pooled data from these two studies demonstrated that, as of the time of the 2022 interim analysis, single and multiple doses of STK-001 up to 45mg were well-tolerated. 27% (15 of 55) of patients experienced a TEAE related to the study drug, all of which were mild or moderate in severity. 22% (12 of 55) of patients had a treatment-emergent serious adverse event, none of which were related to the study drug. The most common TEAEs observed were vomiting, headache and seizures. 33% (18 of 55) of patients experienced CSF protein elevation (>50mg/dL) after dosing, but no clinical manifestations were observed. No TEAEs led to study drug withdrawal.
 One of several secondary endpoints for both the MONARCH and ADMIRAL studies was a comparison of the percentage change in convulsive seizure frequency as measured by daily seizure diaries and calculated over 4-week periods: between baseline and 12 weeks after treatment; and between baseline and end of study. Preliminary analysis using pooled data from the MONARCH and ADMIRAL studies showed that 74% (20 of 27) of patients who were treated with multiple doses of 20mg, 30mg or 45mg of STK-001 and were followed for at least three months after their last dose experienced a reduction from baseline in seizure frequency. Median reductions from baseline in convulsive seizure frequency of 55% (45mg, n=6), 20% (30mg, n=17) and 41% (20mg, n=4) were observed in patients treated with three doses of STK-001 as measured from Day 29 after their first dose to three months after receiving their last dose as illustrated in exhibit 9 below.

 The following PK and CSF exposure findings were also observed as of the time of the 2022 interim analysis: (i) a dose-dependent increase in study drug exposure was observed in plasma with a greater increase observed between 30mg and 45mg than between 20mg and 30mg; (ii) the plasma PK profile was consistent across ADMIRAL and MONARCH patients who were treated at the same dose level; and (iii) CSF exposure was measurable up to six months following single and multiple intrathecal doses of STK-001, indicating sustained exposure of STK-001 in the brain.
 MONARCH and ADMIRAL continue to progress. In the United States, MONARCH enrollment is nearing completion, and dosing is ongoing in the expanded 45mg multiple dose cohort. In the United Kingdom, ADMIRAL 
 14

enrollment is now complete and dosing is ongoing at the 70mg multiple dose cohort. We expect to announce preliminary clinical data on 45mg MAD doses of STK-001 in mid-2023 and additional preliminary clinical data on 70mg MAD doses of STK-001 in the second half of 2023.  
 SWALLOWTAIL and LONGWING Open Label Extension Studies
 In January 2021, we initiated enrollment and dosing in our SWALLOWTAIL Open Label Extension (OLE) study of STK-001 for children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the United States, and in May 2022, we began dosing patients in our LONGWING OLE study of STK-001 for children and adolescents with Dravet syndrome in the United Kingdom. Patients who participated in the MONARCH study in the United States or the ADMIRAL study in the United Kingdom and meet study entry criteria are eligible to continue treatment in SWALLOWTAIL or LONGWING, respectively, both of which are designed to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of repeated doses of STK-001. SWALLOWTAIL and LONGWING will also provide valuable information on the preliminary effects of STK-001 on seizures along with non-seizure aspects of the disease, such as quality of life and cognition. Following interactions with regulatory agencies, we have agreed to limit chronic dosing in SWALLOWTAIL to 30mg and in LONGWING to 45mg. 
 In December 2021 we presented initial data from the SWALLOWTAIL study that demonstrated that multiple doses up to 30mg of STK-001 intrathecally every four months appears to be well tolerated. In addition, preliminary data from a small cohort of patients treated in the SWALLOWTAIL OLE was presented at the AES 2022 Annual Meeting and showed the effects of ongoing treatment with 30mg of STK-001, including:
  
• | a safety profile consistent with MONARCH and ADMIRAL;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | reductions in convulsive seizure frequency that were observed in MONARCH were maintained with ongoing treatment in the SWALLOWTAIL OLE, as illustrated in exhibit 14 below; and

 We have not yet discussed with regulatory authorities the evidence necessary for approval of STK-001. However, if we see evidence of clinical efficacy as we dose escalate, then we would plan to meet with regulatory authorities to discuss expedited regulatory pathways. 
 STK-002 for the treatment of Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA)
 STK-002 is our lead clinical candidate for the treatment of ADOA. STK-002 is designed to upregulate OPA1 protein expression by leveraging the non-mutant (wild-type) copy of the OPA1 gene to restore OPA1 protein expression with the aim to stop or slow vision loss in patients with ADOA. To date, we have generated preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-mechanism and proof-of-concept for STK-002. 
 Disease Overview
 ADOA is the most common inherited optic nerve disorder seen in clinical practice. ADOA causes progressive and irreversible vision loss in both eyes starting in the first decade of life. Many children progress to blindness. Roughly half of people with ADOA fail driving standards and up to 46% are registered as legally blind. The disease affects one in 30,000 people globally with a higher incidence of approximately one in 10,000 in Denmark due to a founder effect. 65% to 90% of ADOA is caused by mutations in one allele of the OPA1 gene, most of which lead to haploinsufficiency and disease manifestation. More than 400 different OPA1 mutations have been reported in people diagnosed with ADOA. Most mutations result in a severe decrease – up to 50% – of the normal amount of the OPA1 protein. There is no strong genotype-phenotype correlation. 
 OPA1 is a dynamin-related GTPase that plays a key role in maintaining mitochondria structure and dynamics. The OPA1 protein is imported into the mitochondria and is the crucial molecule that mediates inner mitochondria membrane fusion and cristae morphogenesis and is critical for oxidative phosphorylation and Adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”) synthesis. Insufficient OPA1 activity causes mitochondria dysfunction with consequent insufficient ATP production, excess reactive oxygen species production and eventual cell death. High energy demanding cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes are particularly susceptible to mitochondria dysfunction, and retinal ganglion cells (“RGCs”) are a neuronal cell type most susceptible to loss of OPA1 protein as evidenced by RGC death in ADOA caused by OPA1 haploinsufficiency. 
 A clinical diagnosis of ADOA is made when a patient meets some or all of the following criteria: pathogenic variant of the OPA1 gene identified in the patient or a family member; reduced visual acuity; temporal disc pallor; visual field defect; color vision defect (acquired blue-yellow loss); thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer and abnormal visual evoked potentials. Clinical findings are based on: intraocular pressure measurement; visual field assessment; color discrimination; dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy; optical coherence tomography; or visual electrophysiology. Patients suspected of ADOA are 
 16

recommended to receive genetic testing to confirm the clinical diagnosis, help identify other family members who are affected and ensure patients avoid stressors that could increase disease progression (e.g. smoking, alcohol). The prognosis for many patients with ADOA is poor and the rate of visual loss can be difficult to predict given significant inter- and intra-familial variability. 
 Current Treatments
 There are currently no available treatments for ADOA. Because ADOA causes deterioration of the optic nerves, corrective aids such as glasses or contacts do not help to improve vision lost to the disease. Supportive services and low-vision aids are offered for patients with severely decreased visual acuity. Our ASOs are designed to target the underlying cause of ADOA, which is OPA1 haploinsufficiency, by decreasing a non-productive mRNA splicing event in the OPA1 gene to increase productive OPA1 mRNA and OPA1 protein in the retinal ganglion cells. 
 Preclinical data
We previously identified a novel exon inclusion event (“Exon X”) in OPA1 that leads to non-productive mRNA due to introduction of a premature termination codon (“PTC”) (exhibit 16 below). Our preclinical studies showed that our ASOs blocked the incorporation of Exon X with consequent dose-dependent increase in productive OPA1 mRNA and protein due to reduction of Exon X-directed non-sense mediated decay (“NMD”) of OPA1 mRNA (exhibit 17 below). We have now demonstrated that a single injection of ASO-14 surrogate in the rabbit eye leads to a dose-dependent increase in ASO accumulation in the retina that correlated with an increase in target engagement (removal of Exon X) and an increase in OPA1 protein (exhibit 18 below). The study was conducted using female New Zealand white rabbits that were injected with a single dose of vehicle alone or vehicle containing ASO (n=3/group). On Days 15 and 29, the retinal tissue was collected and analyzed. Retinal exposure of ASO-14 surrogate (ST-1102) was elevated with increased dosing, dose-dependent target engagement was seen at all three time-points examined, and protein increase of OPA1 protein was observed at both Day 15 and Day 29 of the study. We further showed that in OPA1 haploinsufficient human cells, ASO-14-mediated increase in OPA1 protein translates to improved mitochondrial function as measured by the substantial restoration of ATP levels in the treated cells (exhibit 19 below). ATP is produced by the mitochondria and is the key energy carrying molecule in cells. We observed a 20% ATP deficit in OPA1 +/- HEK293. Treatment with ASO-14 restored ATP levels to ~90% of control cells.

In May 2021, we presented new preclinical efficacy data at the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting demonstrating that our TANGO ASOs can increase OPA1 protein levels and improve mitochondrial function in human cells derived from ADOA patients with different OPA1 mutations. Exhibit 20 below demonstrates that our TANGO ASO increases OPA1 protein and ATP linked mitochondrial respiration in ADOA patient cells.

 In May 2022, we presented further preclinical data for STK-002 demonstrating in-vivo, dose-related target engagement and OPA1 protein upregulation with sustained effect in NHP retinal tissue following administration of STK-002 (Exhibit 21). Additionally, a dose-related increase in OPA1 protein was detected in retinal ganglion cells of NHPs treated with STK-002.

ASGCT; May 16-19, 2022.
 Clinical Plans
 In August 2022, we announced enrollment of the first patient in our two-year prospective natural history study of people ages 8 to 60 who have a confirmed diagnosis of ADOA that is caused by an OPA1 mutation (FALCON study). The FALCON study is designed to evaluate the rate of change in structural and functional ophthalmic assessments. Data collected from the FALCON study will support the clinical development of STK-002. We submitted a CTA in the United Kingdom in the first half of 2023 to enable a potential Phase 1/2 trial for STK-002 in 2024.
 Additional product opportunities 
 We are also advancing additional programs focused on multiple targets, including haploinsufficiency diseases of the CNS and eye. These tissues are affected in many severe genetic diseases. 
 Longer-term, we believe that ASOs designed using TANGO may have the potential to upregulate non-mutated genes in biological pathways to treat diseases or conditions caused by multiple genes or are multifactorial, such as autoimmune diseases, aging and cancer. For these diseases, we intend to opportunistically secure partnerships with biopharmaceutical partners whose scientific, development or commercial capabilities complement our own. 
 Acadia License and Collaboration Agreement
 In January 2022, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Acadia”) for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel RNA-based medicines for the treatment of severe and rare genetic neurodevelopmental diseases of the CNS. The agreement focuses on the targets SYNGAP1, MECP2 (Rett syndrome), and an undisclosed neurodevelopmental target of mutual interest. In connection with each target, we will collaborate with Acadia to identify potential treatments for further development and commercialization as licensed products. With respect to SYNGAP1, we have agreed with Acadia to co-develop and co-commercialize licensed products for such target globally, and in connection therewith we granted to Acadia worldwide, co-exclusive (with us) licenses for such licensed products. With respect to MECP2 and the neurodevelopmental target, we granted to Acadia worldwide, exclusive licenses to develop and commercialize licensed products for such targets. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $60 million from Acadia. Acadia agreed to fund the research to identify potential licensed products for MECP2 and the neurodevelopmental target, and we will equally fund with Acadia the research to identify potential licensed products for SYNGAP1. We are eligible to receive up to $907.5 million in potential total milestone payments based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory, first commercial sales and sales milestone events across the programs for the three targets, assuming each milestone were achieved at least once. With respect to licensed products for MECP2 and the neurodevelopmental target, we are also eligible 
 20

to receive tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-single digits to the mid-teens on future net sales by Acadia of licensed products worldwide. Royalties payable under the agreement are subject to standard royalty reductions. For SYNGAP1 licensed products that we are co-developing and co-commercializing, we will be responsible for 50% of the development and commercialization costs and will receive 50% of the profits from global commercialization.
 With respect to each SYNGAP1 licensed product being co-developed or co-commercialized, the agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated, until the parties have agreed to permanently abandon the further development and commercialization of such licensed product. With respect to licensed products for MECP2 and the neurodevelopmental target, the agreement will remain in effect, unless earlier terminated, until the expiration, on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis, of the applicable royalty term, at which point the license for such licensed product shall become fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable in such country.
 The agreement also contains customary provisions for termination by Acadia for convenience and by either party for cause, including for material breach (subject to cure). We have standard reversion rights in connection with certain early termination events.
 SYNGAP1 syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability that is evident in early childhood. Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene (which produces the SynGAP protein) were first identified in 2009 and since then, an increasing number of children with SYNGAP1 syndrome have been identified. Normal levels of SynGAP protein are essential for proper brain function and development. Mutations in the SYNGAP1 gene also play an important role in the development of epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). The severity and onset of symptoms can vary from patient to patient. SYNGAP1 syndrome is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, generalized epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other behavioral abnormalities. More than 80% of cases of SYNGAP1 syndrome are caused by a haploinsufficiency of the SYNGAP1 gene. SYNGAP1 syndrome is estimated to account for 1% to 2% of all intellectual disability cases. There are currently no approved treatments for SYNGAP1 syndrome.
 Rett syndrome is a rare, debilitating neurological disorder that occurs primarily in females following apparently normal development for the first six months of life. Rett syndrome is often misdiagnosed as autism, cerebral palsy, or non-specific developmental delay. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations on the X chromosome on a gene called MECP2. There are more than 200 different mutations found on the MECP2 gene that interfere with its ability to generate a normal gene product. Rett syndrome occurs worldwide in approximately one of every 10,000 to 15,000 female births and in the United States impacts 6,000 to 9,000 patients. Rett syndrome causes problems in brain function that are responsible for cognitive, sensory, emotional, motor and autonomic function. Typically, with symptoms presenting between 6 to 18 months of age, patients experience a period of rapid decline with loss of purposeful hand use (fine motor skills), development of hand stereotypies, absent or impaired mobility (gross motor skills), loss of communication skills (including eye contact) and inability to independently conduct activities of daily living. Symptoms also include seizures, disorganized breathing patterns, an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis), and sleep disturbances. Currently, there are no FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of Rett syndrome.
 COVID-19
 We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to mitigate interruptions to our clinical programs, research efforts and other business activities and to monitor the safety and well-being of our employees, patients and communities, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and COVID-19 variants, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.

Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties to manufacture our products undergoing late-preclinical testing and anticipate using third parties for all clinical and commercial manufacturing. We do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution, or testing. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and good project management to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities. We will continue to expand and strengthen our network of third-party providers but may also consider investing in additional internal manufacturing capabilities in the future if there is a technical need, or a strategic or financial benefit. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose procedural and documentation requirements. At a minimum these regulations govern record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance. Our systems, procedures and contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations and are assessed through regular monitoring and formal audits. 
 Drug substance 
 Oligonucleotide drug substance requirements for our most advanced programs can be readily met by a variety of domestic and international contractors. Many of these contractors are also able to source all the required raw materials, which allows us to consolidate raw material procurement and drug substance manufacturing activities with a single supplier. To ensure supply chain continuity, we plan to establish supply agreements with alternative suppliers as appropriate. As part of each development program, efforts will be made to invest in process changes to improve purity and yield as warranted. 
 Future drug substance compositions may require different manufacturing capabilities, which will be addressed through either expanded capability with existing contractors or establishing manufacturing supply relationships with new contractors. These changes in composition may also require new supply chain agreements with contractors that specialize in raw material manufacturing. Our internal personnel will work to identify and establish relationships with contractors that may be ideally suited to meeting these new manufacturing requirements. 
 Drug product 
 In the near future, we expect all our oligonucleotide drug products to consist of drug substance formulated in either saline, buffered saline, or some other diluent appropriate for intrathecal, intraocular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. These types of formulations can be manufactured using common processes and readily available materials. We are establishing agreements with a variety of contractors that are suitably equipped to manufacture, package, and test these types of oligonucleotide drug product formulations for subsequent shipment to clinical sites. Several of these manufacturers would also be capable of formulation and packaging for commercial use. 
 Competition 
 The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, and the genetic medicines fields, are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge in the field of biologics, RNA splicing, and antisense oligonucleotide chemistry provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 While therapeutic modalities, including gene therapy, gene editing, modified RNA and protein-based drugs, are currently being developed to address monogenic diseases, most of these approaches are focused on autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant gain-of-function diseases. The nature and fundamental limitations of these approaches make them less suited for addressing the underlying cause of autosomal dominant haploinsufficiencies. Other next generation antisense oligonucleotides have also generally had limited success in upregulating gene expression of haploinsufficiencies, due to a focus on indirectly and weakly validated mechanisms of action such as targeting microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs that are associated with a gene transcript. We are pioneers in developing disease-modifying therapies to treat haploinsufficiencies and are uniquely positioned to exploit this significant opportunity with our TANGO platform.

If our current product candidate, STK-001, is approved for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, it may compete with other products currently marketed or in development. Currently marketed ASMs range from cannabidiols, such as Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex, Fintepla® (fenfluramine) from UCB, to GABA receptor agonists, such as clobazam and stiripentol, to glutamate blockers, such as topiramate. Companies such as Ovid Therapeutics/Takeda, Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Eisai Pharmaceuticals, Epygenix, Longboard Pharmaceuticals, CAMP4, Encoded Therapeutics and others are also developing treatments for Dravet syndrome. Many of the currently marketed ASMs are available as generics. In addition, numerous compounds are in clinical development for treatment of epilepsy. To our knowledge, the clinical development pipeline includes cannabinoids, 5-HT release stimulants, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase inhibitors, and sodium channel antagonists from a variety of companies. Importantly, we believe none of the drugs in clinical development address the underlying genetic cause of Dravet syndrome. 
 Our second product candidate, STK-002, is in development for treatment of ADOA. There are no products currently marketed or in clinical development for treatment of ADOA. To our knowledge, there are also very limited preclinical development efforts beyond our product candidate. PYC Therapeutics is developing a cell penetrating peptide PMO conjugated to ASO for treatment of ADOA.   
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of the entry of our products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of other drugs. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement. 
 Reimbursement 
 The regulations that govern pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription biopharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, a drug company can obtain regulatory approval for a product in a country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of that product. 
 A drug company’s ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if one or more products are successfully brought to the market, these products may not be considered cost effective, and the amount reimbursed for such products may be insufficient to allow them to be sold on a competitive basis. Third-party payors who reimburse patients or healthcare providers, such as government plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are seeking to reduce the prices charged or the amounts reimbursed for biopharmaceutical products. 
 Significant delays can occur in obtaining reimbursement for newly-approved drugs or therapeutic biologics, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug or therapeutic biologic is approved by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that covers a drug company’s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. 
 Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover a drug company’s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may be based on payments allowed for lower cost drugs or therapeutic biologics that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs or therapeutic biologics may be reduced 
 23

by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs or therapeutic biologics from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among, other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. Our patent portfolio, including in-licensed patents and patent applications, is intended to cover, but is not limited to, our technology platforms, product candidates and components thereof, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that are commercially important to our business. We also rely on trade secret protection of our confidential information and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, platforms and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our position in our TANGO platform and product candidates. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; to defend against challenges and assertions by third parties of their purported intellectual property rights; and to operate without infringement of valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 
With respect to our TANGO platform, we have exclusively licensed intellectual property for our TANGO technology from the University of Southampton and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which includes issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that cover the TANGO mechanisms. As of December 31, 2022, the issued U.S. patents, issued foreign patents, pending U.S. patent applications and pending foreign patent applications that we have licensed from the University of Southampton are anticipated to expire between 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2022, the issued U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications and pending foreign patent applications that we have licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory are anticipated to expire in 2035, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
Separately, we have obtained patents and filed patent applications with claims that are intended to cover compositions of matter of oligonucleotides designed to target specific elements in genes for many genetic diseases that we believe are amenable to upregulation of target protein expression using our TANGO platform. As of December 31, 2022, the issued U.S. patents, the issued foreign patents and any patents that may issue from the currently pending patent applications, including PCT international applications, U.S. patent applications, and foreign patent applications, are expected to expire between 2036 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to STK-001, as of December 31, 2022, we have exclusively licensed U.S. patents that cover the mechanism of action of STK-001, as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. The issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2022, we also own U.S. patents, pending U.S. patent applications, foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications relating to STK-001, and the U.S. patents any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 With respect to STK-002, as of December 31, 2022, we have exclusively licensed U.S. patents that cover the mechanism of action of STK-002, as well as foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. The issued patents and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2035 and 2036, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2022, we also own pending U.S. patent applications, and pending foreign patent applications relating to STK-002, and any patents that may issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the 
 24

term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO. For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. For more information on patent term extensions, see “Business—Government regulation: The Hatch-Waxman Act—Patent term extension”. In the future, if and when our biopharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Our currently issued patents will likely expire on dates ranging from 2035 to 2038, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2036 to 2043, unless we receive patent term extension or patent term adjustment, or both. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of genetic therapy has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in the patent laws and rules, either by legislation, judicial decisions, or regulatory interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, importing or otherwise commercializing any of our patented inventions, either directly or indirectly, will depend in part on our success in obtaining, defending and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our platform and product candidates and the methods used to manufacture them. Moreover, our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our platform’s product candidates. The area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our TANGO platform and product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related platforms or product candidates or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our TANGO platform and product candidates. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. For these reasons, we may have competition for our TANGO platform and product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before any product candidate can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent. For this and other risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and product candidates, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
 We have filed for trademark protection of the “Stoke Therapeutics” mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and foreign trademark organizations. We have registered, and intend to maintain, the trademark “Stoke Therapeutics” in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in numerous other jurisdictions, including but not limited to the European Union, China, India, and Canada.
 We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality 
 25

and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions. Despite these efforts, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. 
 We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in relation to the resulting know-how or inventions. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.” 
 License and research agreements 
 In July 2015, we entered into a worldwide license agreement, or the CSHL Agreement, with CSHL, with respect to TANGO patents. Under the CSHL Agreement, we receive an exclusive (except with respect to certain government rights and non-exclusive licenses), worldwide license under certain patents and applications relating to TANGO. The CSHL Agreement obligates us to make payments that are contingent upon certain milestones being achieved. We are also required to pay royalties, tiered based on the scope of patent coverage for each licensed product, ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a mid-single digit percentage on annual net sales. These royalty obligations apply on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a CSHL patent covering the applicable licensed product or (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the applicable licensed product. In addition, if we sublicense the rights under the CSHL Agreement, we are required to pay a maximum of twenty percent of the sublicense revenue to CSHL, which may be reduced to a mid-teens or a mid-single digit percentage upon achievement of certain clinical milestones for the applicable licensed product. Finally, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $0.01 million, which amount is creditable against any owed royalty or milestone payments. The maximum aggregate potential milestone payments payable total approximately $0.9 million. Additionally, certain licenses under the CSHL Agreement require us to reimburse CSHL for certain past and ongoing patent related expenses, however there were no expenses related to these reimbursable patent costs during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. In February 2023, we delivered a notice of termination of the CSHL Agreement to CSHL, and we expect the CSHL Agreement to be terminated within 90 days of such notice. We do not expect the termination of the CSHL Agreement to have a significant impact on the intellectual property underlying any of our current product candidates, including STK-001 and STK-002, or our continued development of the TANGO platform.
 In April 2016, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the University of Southampton (the “Southampton Agreement”), whereby we acquired rights to foundational technologies related to our TANGO technology. Under the Southampton Agreement, we receive an exclusive, worldwide license under certain licensed patents and applications relating to TANGO. Under the Southampton Agreement, we may be obligated to make additional payments that are contingent upon certain milestones being achieved, as well as royalties on future product sales. These royalty obligations survive until the latest of (i) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering a subject product or (ii) the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity for the subject product in a country. In addition, if we sublicense its rights under the Southampton Agreement, we are required to pay a mid-single digit percentage of the sublicense revenue to the University of Southampton. As of December 31, 2022, we had paid $0.7 million under the Southampton Agreement as a result of entering into the Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. license and collaboration agreement in January 2022 (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K). Additionally, certain licenses under the Southampton Agreement require us to reimburse the University of Southampton for certain past and ongoing patent related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022 these expenses were $0.02 million compared to $0.12 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 Government Regulation 
 FDA approval process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with 
 26

applicable U.S. regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as a clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing followed by submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. Data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials are required to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical requirements include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, pharmacology and toxicity studies in animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. The clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin after a safe to proceed communication is received from the FDA.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard designed to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles, qualifications and responsibilities of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order a clinical hold, which is the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. If FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (“IRB”), for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug generally for a specific indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances, including (1) where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible or (2) when in conjunction with other confirmatory evidence. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $3,117,218 for fiscal year 2022, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently $369,413 for each prescription drug product. These fees are typically increased annually. Sponsors of applications for drugs granted Orphan Drug Designation are exempt from these user fees. 
 27

FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. FDA may request additional information rather than file an NDA. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before FDA files it. Once the submission is accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth review. FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months of the date of submission of the new drug application to FDA; the target review period for priority review drugs is six months from the date of filing (accepted for review by the FDA) of the new drug application. Priority review can be applied to an application for a drug that treats a serious condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over existing treatments or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an external drug advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians, statisticians, patient representatives and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 
 Before approving an NDA, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even after an applicant submits additional information, FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. FDA may also require a REMS for a drug that is already on the market if it determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS plan is necessary to ensure that the products benefits outweigh its risks.  
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 Fast Track Designation, Breakthrough Designation, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review 
 
The following four FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review. 
 Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. Fast Track Designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions so that an approved product can reach the market expeditiously. If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, and FDA may review sections of the NDA before the full 
 28

application is complete. This rolling review is available if, in agreement with the FDA, the applicant provides, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information. However, the FDA does not start the review clock for the application until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by FDA if they believe that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging data in the development process.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation may be granted by the FDA to the development of a new drug and also for a new use or indication of an approved drug. This designation requires preliminary clinical evidence of a treatment effect that may represent substantial improvement over available therapies for the treatment of a serious condition. FDA expects that such evidence generally would be derived from early phase trials such as phase 1 or 2 trials. For purposes of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, preliminary clinical evidence refers to evidence that is sufficient to indicate that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement in effectiveness or safety over available therapies. A Breakthrough Therapy Designation conveys more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program. FDA also has an organizational commitment to involve senior management in such guidance. Such guidance may include holding meetings with the sponsor and review team throughout the development of the drug, providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the non-clinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as possible, and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.
 The FDA’s accelerated approval pathway is available under FDA’s accelerated approval regulations and under the FDCA for drugs that have been granted Fast Track designation. FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous and mandatory post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by FDA. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (“FDORA”) was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval.  FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study.  FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.
 A drug candidate is eligible for priority review, or review within a six-month time frame from the time an NDA is filed by FDA, if the drug candidate is intended for the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious or life-threatening condition, demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need, or provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs.
 Orphan Drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such 
 29

as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and an exemption from the NDA user fee. 
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program 
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved marketing application for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease. The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application. 
 A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application. A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA or a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years; in general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S.; the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review; the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition); the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by FDA; and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population. Before NDA approval, FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher. 
 To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher. If FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA is approved, FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA. FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the product’s approval. 
 
The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA or biologics license application, or BLA, and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA or BLA. The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify FDA of is intent to submit the voucher with the NDA or BLA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA or BLA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee ($1,226,651 in fiscal year 2022). FDA must take action on an NDA or BLA under priority review within six months of filing the NDA or BLA by FDA. 
 On December 27, 2020, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program was extended. Under the current statutory sunset provisions, after September 30, 2024, FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. Without further statutory amendments, after September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers.  
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. FDA also may require post-marketing testing or studies, known as Phase 4 commitments, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 30

Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. With certain exceptions, the PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the “BPCA”), provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or nonpatent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
 Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The government recently released a regulation and policy to expand and enhance the requirements related to registering and reporting the results of clinical trials, which may result in greater enforcement of these requirements in the future.
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 31

Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, can be the subject of a three-year period if the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to the approval of the application. FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change during the exclusivity period.
 Patent term extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for extension and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other healthcare laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. 
 Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, the ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 32

Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits, among other things, the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offeror or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the storage, use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of security of individually identifiable health information. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 
 Further, pursuant to the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (the “CMS”) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report annually information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance practice nurses and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such providers, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The reported data is made available in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. Some states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justifying price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Certain states and local jurisdictions also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 Efforts to ensure that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. If a drug company’s operations are found to be in violation of any such requirements, it may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA, exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement or other federal or state government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, and reputational harm. Although effective compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, these risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action for an alleged or suspected violation can cause a drug company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business, even if such action is successfully defended. 
 Possible change in law or policy
 Healthcare reforms that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, could result in further reductions in coverage and levels of reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, increases in rebates payable under U.S. government rebate programs and additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical product prices.   Healthcare reform proposals recently culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (the “IRA”), which will, among other things, allow the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D (excluding drugs and biologics that are designated and approved for only one rare disease or condition), although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 
 33

years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2022 for Medicare Part D and January 2023 for Medicare Part B, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part D and Part B drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation. In addition, the IRA will eliminate, beginning in 2025, the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.  It is unclear to what extent other statutory, regulatory, and administrative initiatives will be enacted and implemented. 
 Foreign regulation 
 Clinical trials
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. For clinical trials, many countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application similar to the process in the United States. However, the specific requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials vary greatly from country to country. In the European Union, for example, clinical trials are governed by the new EU Regulation on Clinical Trials (Reg. EU No. 536/2014) (the “CTR”) that has become applicable on January 31, 2022. The CTR stipulates the process of obtaining competent authority approval for clinical trials. Under the CTR, trial sponsors submit their application for approval via an EU Portal. While the procedure for approval is conducted in a coordinated manner among the concerned EU Member States as provided under the CTR, the approvals will still have to be granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States where a trial takes place. The CTR has streamlined the process for the application and granting of the approvals in comparison with the predecessor legislation, Directive 2001/20/EC on clinical trials (the “CTD”). However, the process of obtaining clinical trial approval in the EU is still complex and can significantly delay the start of a multinational clinical trial.
 Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on December 31, 2020, different rules apply in the United Kingdom from the European Union. 
 Approval and reimbursement
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval or licensing of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence marketing of the product in those countries. The approval processes for both approval and marketing of commercial drugs vary from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 
 The requirements governing the product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 
 To obtain regulatory approval of a medicinal product under EU regulatory systems, a sponsor must submit a marketing authorization application. The grant of marketing authorization in the EU is governed by Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, commonly known as the Community Code and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorization and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), commonly referred to as the EMA Regulation. In addition, Regulation 1394/2007/EC on advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMP”) lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue engineered products. The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”) is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMP. The role of CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for an ATMP candidate. EMA then provides a final opinion regarding the application for marketing authorization. The European Commission grants or refuses marketing authorization after the EMA has delivered its opinion.
 Innovative medicinal products are authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies, in whole or in part, on data in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved medicinal product). Applications for marketing authorization for innovative 
 34

medicinal products must contain the results of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials conducted with the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is sought. 
 EU legislation provides for a system of regulatory data and market exclusivity. According to Article 14(11) of the EMA Regulation, and Article 10(1) of the Community Code, upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities approved on the basis of complete independent data package benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder, or MAH, obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the innovator is able to gain the period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an application with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials. Depending upon the timing and duration of the EU marketing authorization process, products may be eligible for up to five years’ supplementary protection certificates, or SPC, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. Such SPC extend the rights under the basic patent for the drug.
 Products authorized as “orphan medicinal products” in the EU are entitled to benefits additional to those granted in relation to innovative medicinal products. In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the incentives derived from orphan medicinal product status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Further guidance on such criteria is provided in European Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 of 27 April 2000 laying down the provisions for implementation of the criteria for designation of a medicinal product as an orphan medicinal product and definitions of the concepts “similar medicinal product” and “clinical superiority”. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and following grant of a marketing authorization, EMA and the EU Member States’ competent authorities are not permitted to accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization or accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization, for the same therapeutic indication of a similar medicinal product for ten years following grant or authorization. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant may receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The 10-year market exclusivity that an orphan drug enjoys may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product during the 10-year period of market exclusivity for the same therapeutic indication at any time if:
  
• | The second applicant can establish in its application that its product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The holder of the marketing authorization for the original orphan medicinal product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar to obligations imposed in the United States, medicinal products authorized in the EU may be subject to post-authorization obligations, including the obligation to conduct Post Marketing Safety Studies (“PASS”) or Post Marketing Efficacy Studies (“PAES”).
 35

Reimbursement for medicinal products is still an area that is not harmonized in the EU, but largely governed by EU Member States’ laws. At EU level, Council Directive 89/105/EEC (the “Price Transparency Directive”) aims to ensure that pricing and reimbursement mechanisms established in EU Member States are transparent and objective, do not hinder the free movement and trade of medicinal products in the EU and do not hinder, prevent or distort competition on the market. The Price Transparency Directive does not, however, provide any guidance concerning the specific criteria based on which pricing and reimbursement decisions are to be made in individual EU Member States. Neither does it have any direct consequence for pricing or levels of reimbursement in individual EU Member States. The national authorities of the individual EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices and/or reimbursement of medicinal products for human use. Individual EU Member States adopt policies according to which a specific price or level of reimbursement is approved for the medicinal product. Other EU Member States adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territory either, on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries, or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Furthermore, some EU Member States impose direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market.
 Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in EU Member States. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of the use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the national healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
 The outcome of HTA may influence the pricing and reimbursement status for specific medicinal products within individual EU member states. The extent to which pricing and imbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of a specific medicinal product vary between the EU Member States.
 A new EU Regulation on HTA was adopted on December 13, 2021, Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2021 on health technology assessment and amending Directive 2011/24/EU (“HTA Regulation”). It will become applicable on January12, 2025. The HTA Regulation covers new medicines and certain new medical devices, “providing the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas.” Member states will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas: 1) joint clinical assessments focusing on the most innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients; 2) joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities; 3) identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early; and 4) continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technology, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.
 In the United Kingdom and following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, EU medicines regulation has been adopted as standalone United Kingdom legislation with some amendments to reflect procedural and other requirements with respect to marketing authorizations and other regulatory provisions.
 In order to market a medicinal product in the United Kingdom, a license or marketing authorization must be obtained from the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”). The United Kingdom legislation includes multiple assessment routes for applications for medicinal products, including a 150-day national assessment or a rolling review application. Further, and for a transitional period until December 31, 2023, the MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure. In addition, the MHRA has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU member states.
 The MHRA reviews applications for orphan designation at the time of a marketing authorization application or as part of a subsequent variation to that authorization. To qualify for orphan designation, a medicine must meet certain criteria in the United Kingdom including that the medicine for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, the prevalence of the condition must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that the marketing would generate sufficient returns to justify investment and no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment must exist in Great Britain or, if such a method exists the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. On grant of a marketing authorization with orphan status, the medicinal product will benefit from up to 10 years of market exclusivity from similar products in the approved orphan indication starting from the date of first approval of the product in Great Britain.
 36

The United Kingdom has adopted new legislation, the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 and may make changes to the licensing or authorization of medicines in the future. The separate UK authorization system, albeit with transitional recognition procedures in the UK, may lead to additional regulatory costs. In addition, further regulatory costs will be incurred with respect to the lack of mutual recognition of batch testing and related regulatory measures between the European Union and the United Kingdom.
 Reimbursement in the United Kingdom for use by public payors (National Health Service) organizations may depend on a positive technology assessment by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”). A positive recommendation by NICE would lead to an obligation to fund, subject to terms of that approval, by NHS organizations. In assessing any new medicinal product, NICE will take into account clinical as well as the economic value of the product.
 Failure to obtain positive reimbursement recommendations or failure to obtain government and third-party payor reimbursement coverage in foreign countries may affect the marketability and commercial sales of any product candidates for which regulatory approval is received.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
