Business Overview
We responsibly produce several of the raw materials needed for clean energy and advanced technologies, including uranium, rare earth elements and vanadium. 
 13


Our primary product is U3O8 (also known as natural uranium concentrate or yellowcake), which, when further processed, becomes the fuel for the generation of clean nuclear energy. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, nuclear energy provides nearly 20% of the total electricity and 50% of the clean, carbon-free electricity generated in the U.S. The Company generates revenues from extracting and processing materials for the recovery of uranium, vanadium and REEs for our own account, as well as from toll processing materials for others.
Energy Fuels is engaged in conventional and ISR uranium extraction and recovery, along with the exploration, permitting, and evaluation of uranium properties in the U.S. The Company also extracts and recovers vanadium from certain of its uranium projects, as market conditions warrant. In 2021, the Company commenced its ramp-up to commercial production of REE carbonate (“RE Carbonate”), another byproduct of the uranium recovery process, and produced and sold commercial quantities of RE Carbonate in 2021 and 2022 and plans to continue its RE Carbonate sales in 2023. To further its REE initiatives, the Company is currently undertaking enhancements and modifications to existing circuits at the Mill for the planned commercial separation of neodymium-praseodymium (“NdPr”) oxide from its RE Carbonate for sale in 2024, while at the same time producing a “heavies” (Sm+) RE Carbonate for sale in 2024. The Company also continues to evaluate the potential to recover radioisotopes from its existing process streams needed for emerging TAT cancer therapeutics.
The Company’s Mill, located near Blanding, San Juan County, Utah, is the only conventional uranium, vanadium and REE recovery facility operating in the U.S., having a licensed capacity of over 8 million pounds of U3O8 per year. In addition to uranium, the Mill can recover vanadium as a co-product of mineralized material produced from certain of its projects in Colorado and Utah and from solutions in its tailings impoundment system, as market conditions warrant. The Mill is also currently producing RE Carbonate from various uranium- and REE-bearing ores acquired from third parties and is in the process of developing planned REE separation capabilities at the Mill. The Company is also securing its own sources of uranium- and REE-bearing monazite sands, and in February 2023 acquired the Bahia Project in Brazil (see “Material Transactions,” “2022 Corporate Developments” and Item 2, “The Bahia Project,” below), in furtherance of a fully integrated U.S.-based REE supply chain. The Company continues to engage in active discussions to secure other sources of monazite sands, thereby diversifying its supply base and strengthening its REE business. In addition, Energy Fuels recovers uranium from other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional material, referred to as “Alternate Feed Materials,” at its Mill, thereby recycling materials back into the market that would otherwise be lost to direct disposal.
With its uranium, vanadium, REE and potentially radioisotope production, the Mill is working to establish itself as a critical minerals hub in the U.S. Uranium is the fuel for carbon-free, emission-free baseload nuclear power, and one of the cleanest forms of energy in the world. The REEs we are now producing are used for the manufacture of permanent magnets for electric vehicles (“EVs”), wind turbines and other clean energy technologies. The radioisotopes we are evaluating for recovery from our REE and uranium processing streams have the potential to provide materials needed for emerging TAT cancer-fighting therapeutics. The very heart of our business – uranium and rare-earth production and recycling – helps us play a big part in addressing global climate change, reducing air pollution, and making the world a cleaner and healthier place. 
The Company owns conventional uranium, uranium/vanadium and heavy mineral properties and projects in various stages of exploration, permitting, and evaluation, as well as fully permitted uranium and uranium/vanadium projects on standby. 
Energy Fuels also owns the Nichols Ranch Uranium Recovery Facility in Wyoming (the “Nichols Ranch Project”), which is a fully permitted uranium ISR facility with a licensed capacity of 2 million pounds of U3O8 per year. The Nichols Ranch Project is currently being maintained on standby. 
ISR Operations
The Company conducts its ISR activities through its Nichols Ranch Project in northeast Wyoming, which it acquired in June 2015 through its acquisition of Uranerz Energy Corporation (“Uranerz”).
The Nichols Ranch Project includes: (i) a licensed and operating ISR processing facility (the “Nichols Ranch Plant”); (ii) licensed and operating ISR wellfields (the “Nichols Ranch Wellfields”); (iii) additional licensed ISR wellfields planned for future production (the “Jane Dough Property”), and; (iv) a licensed satellite ISR uranium project (the “Hank Project”), which will include an ISR satellite processing plant (the “Hank Satellite Plant”) that, when constructed, will produce loaded-resin, and associated planned wellfields (the “Hank Property”). See “The Nichols Ranch ISR Project” under Item 2 below. Also through the acquisition of Uranerz, the Company acquired the West North Butte property (the “West North Butte Property”) and the North Rolling Pin property (the “North Rolling Pin Property”), as well as the Arkose Mining Venture (the “Arkose Mining Venture”), which is a joint venture of Wyoming ISR properties held 81% by Energy Fuels. 
The Nichols Ranch Project is an ISR facility currently on standby that recovers uranium through a series of injection and recovery wells. Using groundwater fortified with oxygen and sodium bicarbonate, uranium is dissolved within a deposit. The 
 14


uranium-bearing groundwater is then collected in a series of recovery wells and pumped to the Nichols Ranch Plant where the uranium is extracted from the water. The Nichols Ranch Plant creates a yellowcake slurry that is transported by truck to the Mill, where it is dried and packaged into drums that are shipped to uranium conversion facilities.
Construction of the Nichols Ranch Plant, other than the elution, drying and packaging circuits, was completed in 2013, and it commenced uranium recovery activities in the second quarter of 2014. In September of 2015, the Company commenced construction of an elution circuit at the Nichols Ranch Plant, which was completed and began operations in February 2016. The Nichols Ranch Project was placed on standby in 2020. As a result, the Company recovered de minimis pounds of U3O8 from the Project in 2022 and expects to recover de minimis quantities of U3O8 in 2023. Nichols Ranch is expected to be able to ramp back up to commercial production levels with limited required capital within approximately twelve months of a production decision. See Part II, Item 7 “Outlook: ISR Activities.”
The Company entered into a definitive agreement in November 2022 to sell its Alta Mesa ISR Project for total consideration of $120 million, which closed on February 14, 2023 (see “Material Transactions,” below).
Conventional Operations
The Company conducts its conventional uranium, REE, vanadium and potential medical radioisotope extraction and recovery activities through the Mill, which is the only operating conventional uranium, REE and vanadium processing facility in the United States. The Mill located near Blanding, San Juan County, Utah, is centrally located such that it can conveniently and cost-effectively be fed by a number of the Company’s uranium and uranium/vanadium projects in Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, as well as by ore purchases or toll milling arrangements with third parties in the region, as market conditions warrant.
The Mill is licensed to process 2,000 tons of ore per day and over 8 million pounds of U3O8 per year. It is primarily a uranium recovery facility but can also recover REEs and vanadium. The Mill is also evaluating the potential to recover certain radioisotopes from its existing process streams that can be used for medical purposes. In addition, the Mill can recycle other uranium-bearing materials not derived from conventional ore, known as Alternate Feed Materials, for the recovery of uranium, alone or in combination with other metals. 
The Mill has historically operated on a campaign basis, whereby mineral processing occurs as mill feed, contract requirements, as market conditions warrant. Over the years, Company-owned and third-party owned conventional uranium properties in Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico have been both active and on standby in response to changing market conditions. From 2007 through 2014, running on a campaign basis, the Mill recovered on average over 1 million pounds of U3O8 per year from conventional sources, including its La Sal complex of uranium and uranium/vanadium projects (the “La Sal Project”), Daneros Project and Tony M property in Utah (the latter two of which were sold in 2021, see Part I, Item 1 “Development of the Business — Major Transactions over the Past Five Years”); its Arizona 1 project (the “Arizona 1 Project”) and its Pinenut project (the “Pinenut Project”) (which is currently in an advanced state of reclamation) in Arizona, and Alternate Feed Materials. During 2018, the Mill recovered 215,719 pounds of U3O8 from processing tailings pond solutions and 561,628 pounds from processing Alternate Feed Materials, of which a total of 82,709 pounds were for the Company’s account and 448,919 pounds were for the account of third parties under a tolling arrangement. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recovered and packaged approximately 162,000 pounds of its final uranium product, U3O8, at the Mill, which was added to the Company’s finished product inventory. The Mill recovered an additional small quantity of uranium, which was retained in-circuit and was not packaged in 2022. During 2022, the Mill also focused on its mixed RE Carbonate production and produced approximately 205 tonnes of high-purity, partially separated mixed RE Carbonate while working to secure additional monazite ore feedstock to increase production. The Company also continued to maintain its Nichols Ranch ISR facility on standby, as well as maintain its Alta Mesa ISR facility (which was sold in February 2023, see “Material Transactions,” below) on standby. 
During 2023, the Company does not plan to recover any pounds of uranium at the Mill, other than uranium from its monazite processing which will likely remain in circuit and not be packaged in 2023, but is instead focusing its uranium efforts on preparing its La Sal, Beaver, Whirlwind and Pinyon Plain projects for future potential production while its Nichols Ranch Project and other conventional mining properties remain on standby. The Company completed the purchase of 181,052 pounds of U.S. origin U3O8 during Q4 2022 and is under contract to purchase an additional 120,000 pounds of U.S.-origin U3O8 during Q1 2023. The Company expects uranium inventories to total approximately 587,000 pounds of U3O8 at year-end 2023, subject to currently unplanned uranium spot sales and purchases.
