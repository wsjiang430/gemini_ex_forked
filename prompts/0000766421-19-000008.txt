ITEM 1. OUR BUSINESS

Alaska Air Group is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1985 that operates two airlines, Alaska and Horizon. Alaska was organized in 1932 and incorporated in 1937 in the state of Alaska. Horizon Air is a Washington corporation that was incorporated and began service in 1981. It was acquired by Air Group in 1986. Virgin America has been a member of Air Group since it was acquired in 2016. In 2018, Virgin America and Alaska combined operating certificates to become a single airline, and legally merged into a single entity. The Company also includes McGee Air Services, an aviation services provider that was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska in 2016. 

Alaska and Horizon operate as separate airlines, with individual business plans, competitive factors and economic risks. Together with our regional partner airlines, we fly to 115 destinations with over 1,200 daily departures through an expansive network across the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Costa Rica. With global airline partners, we provide our guests with a network of more than 900 destinations worldwide. During 2018, we carried an all-time high 46 million guests and earned consolidated net income under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $437 million compared to net income of $960 million in 2017. Our adjusted net income was $554 million, which excludes merger-related costs, special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments. Refer to "Results of Operations" in Management's Discussion and Analysis for our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. 
We organize the business and review financial operating performance by aggregating our business in three operating segments, which are as follows:

• | Mainline - includes scheduled air transportation on Alaska's Boeing or Airbus jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S., and in parts of Canada, Mexico, and Costa Rica.


• | Regional - includes Horizon's and other third-party carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the U.S. under capacity purchase agreements (CPA). This segment includes the actual revenues and expenses associated with regional flying, as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by Air Group on behalf of the regional operations.


• | Horizon - includes the capacity sold to Alaska under CPA. Expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs and maintenance costs.

Our purpose is "creating an airline people love." The "ing" is to recognize that we are never done; we are continually working to improve. We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively. It is important to us that we achieve our objective as a socially responsible company that values not just performance, but also our people, the communities we serve, and the environment. 
In 2018, we focused much of our energy on the integration of Virgin America, completing over 95% of our integration milestones. In January 2018, Alaska and Virgin America received a Single Operating Certificate (SOC) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which recognizes Alaska and Virgin America as one airline. In April 2018, we transitioned to a single Passenger Service System (PSS), which allows us to provide one reservation system, one website and one inventory of flights to our guests. This transition to a single PSS enables us to unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition, and to provide consistent branding to our guests at all airport gates, ticketing, and check-in areas.
The two most important milestones we have yet to complete include combining the maintenance operations of Boeing and Airbus, and reconfiguring our Airbus fleet. In 2018, we painted 33 Airbus aircraft with the Alaska livery and we are in process of reconfiguring all Airbus aircraft to achieve a cabin experience for our guests that is consistent with our Boeing fleet. In early 2019, we will also complete the integration of our crew management systems and aim to reach a collective bargaining agreement with our aircraft technicians, the last remaining labor group that has not yet reached a joint collective bargaining agreement.
With the integration largely behind us, we remain committed to our vision to become the favorite airline for people on the West Coast. The acquisition of Virgin America positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the U.S., with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers. To do so, we believe we need to meet our guests' evolving needs by offering a relevant network and schedule, upgrading our onboard offerings, and retaining our unique West Coast vibe. Some of the more notable product enhancements underway include adding high-speed satellite connectivity to our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets, updating and expanding our airport lounges, and working with the Port of Seattle to open a state-of-the-art 20-gate North Satellite Concourse

at Sea-Tac Airport, including a 15,000 square-foot flagship lounge. We have also introduced new food and beverage menus, which include more fresh, local, and healthy offerings including salads, protein plates, and fresh snacks, as well as new beverage offerings, including craft beers, juices and an updated wine selection.
We are also active in the communities we serve and strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship. In 2018, Air Group donated $17 million in cash and in-kind travel to over 1,300 charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered more than 44,000 hours of community service, related to youth and education, medical research, and transportation. One of our leadership principles is to "give back" and we are proud of the efforts and voluntarism of our employees. As recognition of our community leadership, financial stability and the fact that our combined fleet is one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient in North America, we ranked higher than any other North American airline for the second year in a row on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 
We continued to generate profits in 2018, marking our 15th consecutive year with adjusted net income. Our liquidity and capital position remain strong, positioning us among other high-quality industrial companies. Due to our strong financial health and outlook, we are one of only three U.S. airlines with investment grade credit ratings. The cash generated by our continued success enables us to invest in our business to deliver profitable growth, enhance our guests' experience, and improve our financial position. 
Looking to the future, our vision is to become the West Coast's favorite airline. To do this, we will focus on the following areas:
Safety
Safety is the most important thing we do. We have an unwavering commitment to run a safe operation, and we will not compromise this commitment in the pursuit of other initiatives. Alaska and Horizon were the first U.S. major airlines to receive FAA validation and acceptance of their Safety Management Systems (SMS) in 2016. In 2018, we continued using SMS to safely and consistently guide our integration with the legacy Virgin America operation. Report It!, a new mobile safety reporting application, made it easier than ever for employees to file safety reports. Once again, in 2018, 100% of our Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians completed the requirements for the FAA's "Diamond Certificate of Excellence" award. This marks the 17th consecutive year Alaska has received the award, and the 17th time in the last 19 years Horizon has received this award. In 2018 we were also included as one of only two U.S. airlines on the AirlineRatings.com list of the world's Top 20 safest airlines. We also believe that maintaining safe operations, through adherence to well-defined processes, and ensuring every Air Group employee is aware of their individual contribution to our operation, is critical to ensuring on-time performance. The rigor we apply to running a safe operation has resulted in Alaska consistently being one of the top airlines in North America for on-time performance; and Horizon recognized as the leader in on-time performance in 2018 among regional airlines.
Delivering Low Costs
We believe that our low-fare model gives us a competitive advantage by providing significant value to our guests. We also know that, in order to provide low fares in our growing network, while generating strong returns for our shareholders, it is imperative for us to maintain a competitive cost structure. In 2018, our unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, increased 3.1% on a consolidated basis. Although our unit costs are expected to rise again in 2019 primarily due to slower capacity growth, a higher mix of Regional flying, and general wage inflation, we have increased our focus on lowering overhead, improving productivity, and managing vendor costs. We are also actively managing fuel costs by flying larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft, which has increased our fuel efficiency as measured by available seat miles flown per gallon by 1.3% over the last five years. As we work to finalize the integration of our Airbus operations, we are committed to achieving our stated cost and revenue synergy goals. We have a long track record of effective cost control, and we remain keenly committed to protecting our unit cost advantage relative to competitors.
Enabling Our Advantage
Paramount to becoming the West Coast favorite airline is enabling and demonstrating Our Advantage. We do so by delivering great service, great value and providing generous rewards. 

• | Genuine and Caring Service - Providing genuine and caring service to our guests is key to our success, and is demonstrated daily by our employees. As proof, in 2018, Alaska ranked first in the J.D. Power and Associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the 11th year in a row. Alaska was also recognized for excellent service by Condé Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure magazine, continuing an achievement earned by Virgin America for the preceding ten years.

• | Low Fares and Great Value - We offer the highest guest relevance of any carrier from the West Coast, with a 20% lower cost structure than legacy carriers. Competition in our markets is significant, and we know that we must defend our customer base as we grow our network presence by providing guests with an increased choice of schedule times and fares. In 2018, we introduced our Saver Fare product, which will offer greater choice for our guests, allowing them to purchase and pay for the ticket type and other amenities they value most. This, combined with enhancements to our onboard product, will enable us to continue to deliver significant value to our guests. 

We are also focused on providing meaningful utility and routes to our guests. From our West Coast hub cities, we lead all other airlines in non-stop markets, daily flights and seat share. In the past two years, we have significantly expanded our network utility in California, adding 21 new routes and nearly doubling our number of daily flights. We also have focused our new routes announced for 2019 in those areas which connect our guests to high demand markets in the lower 48 states and Hawaii, including 18 daily departures from Paine Field-Snohomish County Airport in Everett, Washington to eight West Coast markets expected to launch in March 2019.

• | Generous Mileage Plan - Our award winning Mileage PlanTM is another way we build long-term guest relationships and enable Our Advantage. We maintain a distance-based frequent flier program, which rewards all fliers regardless of the price they paid for their tickets. In 2018, we leveraged our greater network utility to significantly grow our Mileage PlanTM membership and credit card holders, especially in the state of California. We also offered promotions like Buy One Get One Free companion fares and new redemption benefits, including using miles for hotel redemptions (with access to over 400,000 hotels worldwide), redeeming miles on Finnair flights and adding Aer Lingus as a new global partner.


• | West Coast Vibe - In 2018, we tailored many of our amenities to highlight our West Coast roots. We relaunched our First Class and Main Cabin food menus featuring fresh and local West Coast items, as well as local craft beers and wines. To keep up to speed with the evolving needs and preferences of our West Coast guests, we continue to expand and enhance our on-board amenities, including seat-back power, free movies, TV content and texting. In 2018, we also began installation of next-generation satellite-based Wi-Fi on all of our Mainline aircraft, which will provide our guests with greatly improved on-board internet speed and connectivity. Finally, we continue to connect with West Coast guests through key sponsorships including Russell Wilson, Kevin Durant, the San Jose Sharks, San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Portland Timbers and more.

Being One Team
Our success depends on our more than 23,000 employees living our values every day to deliver superior customer service as a single team. We know engaged employees deliver higher productivity, superior execution and better guest experiences, which is why investing in our people is imperative to our future success. 
In 2018, we focused on our culture to ensure every employee feels valued, informed and engaged. It is a top priority to ensure our employees know where we are, where we are going and how we will get there. To this end, we have implemented new and enhanced communication vehicles, including weekly Leader Look Ahead and periodic live-streamed webcasts, to provide employees better information and a stronger connection to organizational priorities. Additionally, we launched Flight Path - a program that brings employees together through leader-led sessions to inform, engage and set the course for our business and culture. Our efforts were recognized by Forbes Magazine in 2018, who recognized Alaska as one of America's Best Employers for the fourth year in a row.
Aligning our employees' goals with Air Group's goals has been an important contributor to our strong track record of accomplishments and financial performance. The majority of Alaska and Horizon employees participate in our Performance-Based Pay (PBP) and Operational Performance Rewards (OPR) programs, which encourage employees to work together to achieve metrics related to the Company's strategy, including safety, profitability, on-time performance, low costs, customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction. Over the last five years, our incentive programs have paid out on average more than one month's pay for most employees. In 2018, we rewarded our employees with $147 million under these incentive programs.

AIR GROUP
Our airlines operate different aircraft and missions. Alaska operates a fleet of narrowbody passenger jets on primarily longer-haul capacity. Alaska contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Peninsula Aviation Services, Inc. (PenAir), a subsidiary of RAVN Air Group, Inc., for shorter-haul capacity, such that Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights. Horizon operates Embraer 175 (E175) regional jet aircraft and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a CPA. The majority of our revenues are generated by transporting passengers. The percentage of revenues by category is as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016(a) | 2015 | | 2014

MAINLINE
Our Mainline operations include Boeing 737 (B737) and Airbus family (A319, A320, and A321neo) jet service offered by Alaska. We offer extensive passenger service from the western U.S. throughout the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Our largest concentrations of departures are in Seattle, Portland, and the Bay Area. We also offer cargo service throughout our network and have dedicated cargo aircraft that operate primarily to and within the state of Alaska. 

In 2018, we carried 36 million revenue passengers in our Mainline operations. At December 31, 2018, our Mainline operating fleet consisted of 162 Boeing 737 jet aircraft and 71 Airbus A320 family jet aircraft compared to 154 B737 aircraft and 67 Airbus aircraft as of December 31, 2017.

REGIONAL

Our Regional operations consist of flights operated by Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir. In 2018, our Regional operations carried approximately 10 million revenue passengers, primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. Horizon is the largest regional airline in the Pacific Northwest and carries approximately 71% of Air Group's regional revenue passengers. 
Based on 2018 Horizon passenger enplanements on regional aircraft, our most significant concentration of regional activity was in Seattle and Portland. At December 31, 2018, Horizon’s operating fleet consisted of 26 E175 jet aircraft and 39 Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. The regional fleet operated by SkyWest consisted of 32 E175 aircraft.

FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM 
Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan™ provides a comprehensive suite of frequent flyer benefits. Miles can be earned by flying on our airlines or on one of our 17 airline partners, by using an Alaska Airlines credit card, or through other non-airline partners. Alaska's extensive list of airline partners includes carriers associated with each of the three major global alliances, making it easier for our members to earn miles and reach elite status in our frequent flyer program. Through Alaska and our global partners, Mileage Plan™ members have access to a large network of over 900 worldwide travel destinations. Further, members can receive up to 40,000 bonus miles upon signing up for the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card and meeting a minimum spend threshold, and earn triple miles on Alaska Airlines purchases. Alaska Airlines Visa Signature cardholders and small business cardholders in the U.S., and Platinum and World Elite Mastercard cardholders in Canada, also receive an annual companion ticket that allows members to purchase an additional ticket for $99 plus taxes, with no restrictions or black-out dates, and a free first checked bag for up to six people traveling on the same itinerary. Earned miles can be redeemed for flights on our airlines, or our partner airlines, for hotel stays via mileageplanhotels.com, or for upgrades to First Class on Alaska Airlines. We believe all of these benefits give our Mileage Plan™ members more value for their travel.
Mileage Plan™ revenues, including those in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, represented approximately 13% of Air Group's total revenues in 2018. Mileage Plan™ helps drive revenue growth by attracting new customers and building customer loyalty through the benefits that we provide.

AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER AIRLINES
Our agreements fall into three different categories: Frequent Flyer, Codeshare and Interline agreements. Frequent Flyer agreements enable our Mileage PlanTM members to earn mileage credits and make redemptions on one of our 17 domestic and international partner airlines. 
Codeshare agreements allow one or more marketing carriers to sell seats on a single operating carrier that services passengers under multiple flight numbers. The sale of codeshare seats can vary depending on the sale arrangement. For example, in a free-sale arrangement, the marketing carrier sells the operating carrier's inventory without any restriction; whereas in a block space arrangement, a fixed amount of seats are sold to the marketing carrier by the operating carrier. The interchangeability of the flight code between carriers provides a greater selection of flights for customers, along with increased flexibility for mileage accrual and redemption. 
Interline agreements allow airlines to jointly offer a competitive, single-fare itinerary to customers traveling via multiple carriers to a final destination. An interline itinerary offered by one airline may not necessarily be offered by the other, and the fares collected from passengers are prorated and distributed to interline partners according to preexisting agreements between the carriers. Frequent flyer, codeshare and interline agreements help increase our traffic and revenue by providing more route choices to our guests. 
Alaska has marketing alliances with a number of airlines that provide frequent flyer and codesharing opportunities. Alliances are an important part of our strategy and enhance our revenues by:

• | offering our guests more travel destinations and better mileage credit/redemption opportunities, including elite qualifying miles on U.S. and international airline partners;


• | giving our Mileage PlanTM program a competitive advantage because of our partnership with both unaffiliated international carriers and carriers from all three major worldwide alliances;


• | giving us access to more connecting traffic from other airlines; and


• | providing members of our alliance partners’ frequent flyer programs an opportunity to travel on Alaska and our regional partners while earning mileage credit in our partners’ programs.


Most of our codeshare relationships are free-sale codeshares, where the marketing carrier sells seats on the operating carrier’s flights from the operating carrier’s inventory, but takes no inventory risk. Our marketing agreements have various termination dates, and one or more may be in the process of renegotiation at any time. Our codeshare and interline agreements generated 5%, 6%, and 8% of our total marketed revenues as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

CARGO AND OTHER REVENUE
The Company provides freight and mail services (cargo). The majority of cargo services are provided to commercial businesses and the United States Postal Service. The Company satisfies cargo service performance obligations and recognizes revenue when the shipment arrives at its final destination, or is transferred to a third-party carrier for delivery.
The Company also earns other revenue for lounge memberships, hotel and car commissions, and certain other immaterial items not intrinsically tied to providing air travel to passengers. Revenue is recognized when these services are rendered and recorded as Cargo and other revenue.
GENERAL
The airline industry is highly competitive and subject to various uncertainties, including economic conditions, volatile fuel prices, a largely unionized work force, the need to finance large capital expenditures and the related availability of capital, government regulation—including taxes and fees, and potential aircraft incidents. Airlines have high fixed costs, primarily for wages, aircraft fuel, aircraft ownership and facilities rents. Because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly based on the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline’s operating and financial results. In other words, a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact to our operating and financial results. Passenger demand and ticket prices are, in large measure, influenced by the general state of the economy, current global economic and political events, and total available airline seat capacity.
In 2018, the airline industry's profits declined when compared to 2017, primarily due to rising fuel prices, higher labor costs, and increased competitive fare actions reducing ticket prices. Despite some of these headwinds, the industry reported profits in 2018. In the current industry environment, airlines are making significant investments in airports, more fuel-efficient planes and new services to differentiate their customer service offering. Thus, the level of competition is expected to continue to increase.

FUEL
Our business and financial results are highly affected by the price and the availability of aircraft fuel. The cost of aircraft fuel is volatile and outside of our control, and it can have a significant and immediate impact on our operating results. Over the past five years, aircraft fuel expense ranged from 18% to 32% of operating expenses. Fuel prices are impacted by changes in both the price of crude oil and refining costs and can vary by region in the U.S.

The price of crude oil on an average annual basis for the past five years have ranged from a low of $43 per barrel in 2016 to a high of $93 in 2014. For us, a $1 per barrel change in the price of oil equates to approximately $20 million of fuel cost annually. Said another way, a one-cent change in our fuel price per gallon will impact our expected annual fuel cost by approximately $8 million per year.
Refining margins, which represent the price of refining crude oil into aircraft fuel, are a smaller portion of the overall price of jet fuel, but have also contributed to the price volatility in recent years. Over the last five years, average annual West Coast refining margin prices have fluctuated between $13 per barrel to a high of $24 per barrel in 2018.
Generally, West Coast jet fuel prices are somewhat higher and more volatile than prices in the Gulf Coast or on the East Coast. Our average raw fuel cost per gallon increased 28% in 2018, after increasing 21% in 2017 and decreasing 19% in 2016.
The percentages of our aircraft fuel expense by crude oil and refining margins, as well as the percentage of our aircraft fuel expense of operating expenses, are as follows:

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016(a) | 2015 | | 2014
Crude oil | 68 | % | | 66 | % | 69 | % | | 62 | % | 72 | %
Refining margins | 25 | % | | 23 | % | 20 | % | | 26 | % | 18 | %
Other(b) | 7 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | % | | 12 | % | 10 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %
Aircraft fuel expense | 25 | % | | 22 | % | 18 | % | | 22 | % | 32 | %


(a) | Includes information for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.


(b) | Other includes gains and losses on settled fuel hedges, unrealized mark-to-market fuel hedge gains or losses, taxes and other into-plane costs.

We use crude oil call options as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices. Call options effectively cap our pricing for crude oil, limiting our exposure to increasing fuel prices for about half of our planned fuel consumption. With call options, we are hedged against spikes in crude oil prices, and during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. We begin hedging approximately 18 months in advance of consumption.
We believe that operating fuel-efficient aircraft is the best hedge against high fuel prices. Air Group's fuel-efficiency rate expressed in available seat miles flown per gallon (ASMs/g) improved from 76.9 ASMs/g in 2014 to 77.9 ASMs/g in 2018. Maintaining a young, fuel-efficient fleet has not only reduced our fuel consumption rate, but also the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that our aircraft emit.
COMPETITION
Competition in the airline industry is intense and unpredictable. Our competitors consist primarily of other airlines and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation. Competition can be direct, in the form of another carrier flying the exact non-stop route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities non-stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. We compete with other domestic airlines and a limited number of international airlines on nearly all of our scheduled routes. Our largest competitor is Delta Airlines Inc. (Delta), who has significantly increased its capacity in Seattle over the past several years. Approximately 77% of our capacity to and from Seattle competes with Delta. As we have grown in California and have expanded our transcontinental route offerings, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also become large competitors and have increased their capacity in markets we serve. Our California and transcontinental routes have a higher concentration of competitors when compared to our historical route structure, which was predominately concentrated in the Pacific Northwest. Based on schedules filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation, we expect the amount of competitive capacity overlap with all carriers to increase by more than 4% in the first quarter of 2019, weighted based on our network. 
 11

We believe that the following principal competitive factors are important to our guests:


• | Fares and ancillary services

Ticket and other fee pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the increased availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. Pricing is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, market-specific capacity, market share per route/geographic area, cost structure, fare vs. ancillary revenue strategies, and demand. 
For example, airlines often discount fares to drive traffic in new markets or to stimulate traffic when necessary to improve load factors. In addition, traditional network carriers have been able to reduce their operating costs through bankruptcies and mergers, while low-cost carriers have continued to grow their fleets and expand their networks, potentially enabling them to better control costs per available seat mile (the average cost to fly an aircraft seat one mile), which in turn may enable them to lower their fares. These factors can reduce our pricing power and that of the airline industry as a whole.
Domestic airline capacity is dominated by four large carriers, representing over 80% of total seats. One of our advantages is our low fare with high value position in the industry. However, given the large concentration of industry capacity, some carriers in our markets may discount their fares substantially to develop or increase market share. Fares that are substantially below our cost to operate can be harmful if sustained over a long period of time. We will defend our core markets and, if necessary, redeploy capacity to better match supply with demand. We believe our strong financial position and low cost advantage enables us to offer competitive fares while still earning returns for our shareholders.

• | Safety

Safety is our top priority and is at the core of everything we do. In 2018, we were again ranked by AirlineRatings.com as one of only two U.S. airlines in the Top 20 safest airlines in the world. We also received our 17th Diamond Award of Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration, recognizing both Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their commitment to training.


• | Customer service and reputation

We compete with other airlines in areas of customer service such as on-time performance, guest amenities—including first class and other premium seating, quality of on-board products, aircraft type and comfort. In 2018, Alaska Airlines ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers by J.D. Power and Associates for the 11th year in a row. Additionally, in 2018 we completed installation of Premium Class service on our B737 aircraft which provides extra legroom, early boarding, premium snacks and a complimentary alcoholic beverage.
We also began reconfiguring the interior and livery of our Airbus fleet in 2018. The new livery and interior reconfiguration will provide guests with one consistent brand experience across the Mainline fleet. Airbus livery updates are expected to be complete in 2019, while the interior reconfiguration is expected to wrap up in early 2020. We also began installation of next-generation Gogo inflight satellite based Wi-Fi on our entire Boeing and Airbus fleets, which is also planned to be complete in 2020.
Our employees are a key element of our product. We have a highly engaged workforce that strives to provide genuine and caring service to our guests both at the airport and onboard. We heavily emphasize our service standards with our employees through training and education programs and monetary incentives related to operational performance and guest surveys.

• | Routes served, flight schedules, codesharing and interline relationships, and frequent flyer programs

We also compete with other airlines based on markets served, the frequency of service to those markets and frequent flyer opportunities. Some airlines have more extensive route structures than we do and they offer significantly more international routes. In order to expand opportunities for our guests, we enter into codesharing and interline relationships with other airlines that provide reciprocal frequent flyer mileage credit and redemption privileges. These relationships allow us to offer our guests access to more destinations than we can on our own, gain exposure in markets we do not serve and allow our guests more opportunities to earn and redeem frequent flyer miles. Our Mileage Plan™ offers some of the most comprehensive benefits to our members with the ability to earn and redeem miles on 17 partner carriers. In 2018, we added Finnair to our list of codeshare partners, and a number of new interline partners.
 12

In addition to domestic or foreign airlines that we compete with on most of our routes, we compete with ground transportation in our short-haul markets. To some extent, our airlines also compete with technology, such as video conferencing and internet-based meeting tools that have changed the need for, or frequency of, face-to-face business meetings.
TICKET DISTRIBUTION

Our tickets are distributed through three primary channels:


• | Direct to customer: It is less expensive for us to sell through our direct channel at alaskaair.com. We believe direct sales through this channel is preferable from a branding and customer-relationship standpoint in that we can establish ongoing communication with the guest and tailor offers accordingly. As a result, we continue to take steps to drive more business to our website. 


• | Traditional and online travel agencies: Both traditional and online travel agencies typically use Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to obtain their fare and inventory data from airlines. Bookings made through these agencies result in a fee that is charged to the airline. Many of our large corporate customers require us to use these agencies. Some of our competitors do not use this distribution channel and, as a result, have lower ticket distribution costs.


• | Reservation call centers: Our call centers are located in Phoenix, AZ, Kent, WA, and Boise, ID. We generally charge a $15 fee for booking reservations through the call centers.

Our sales by channel are as follows: 

 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 (a) | 2015 | | 2014
Direct to customer | 63 | % | | 62 | % | 61 | % | | 60 | % | 57 | %
Traditional agencies | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 23 | % | | 23 | % | 25 | %
Online travel agencies | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | %
Reservation call centers | 4 | % | | 5 | % | 5 | % | | 6 | % | 6 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


(a) | Includes results for Virgin America for the period December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS
Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our profitability is generally lowest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to fewer departures and passengers. Profitability typically increases in the second quarter and then reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of vacation travel. However, we have significantly moderated the impact of seasonality of our operations through continued growth from the West Coast to leisure destinations, like Hawaii and Costa Rica, and expansion to leisure and business destinations in the mid-continental and eastern U.S.
In addition to passenger loads, factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include: 

• | pricing initiatives by us or our competitors,

•      changes in fuel costs, 

• | increases in competition at our primary airports,


• | general economic conditions and resulting changes in passenger demand, and


• | increases or decreases in passenger and volume-driven variable costs.


Many of the markets we serve experience inclement weather conditions in the winter, causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft, canceling flights and accommodating displaced passengers. Due to our geographic area of operations, we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, particularly in the state of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, than some of our competitors who may be better able to spread the impact of weather-related risks over larger route systems. We also are 
 13

susceptible to congested air space and Air Traffic Control delays due to our heavy concentration of departures from Seattle and San Francisco. 
No material part of our business, or that of our subsidiaries, is dependent upon a single customer, or upon a few high-volume customers.
EMPLOYEES
Our business is labor intensive. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 23,376 (17,520 at Alaska, 4,052 at Horizon, and 1,804 at McGee Air Services) active full-time and part-time employees. Wages and benefits, including variable incentive pay, represented approximately 41% of our total non-fuel operating expenses in 2018 and 39% in 2017. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2018 we paid approximately $25 million in one-time bonuses to employees as a result of tax reform. 
Most major airlines, including Alaska and Horizon, have employee groups that are covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBA). Airlines with unionized work forces generally have higher labor costs than carriers without unionized work forces, and they may not have the ability to adjust labor costs downward quickly enough to respond to new competition or slowing demand. 
As part of the integration, we have been working to bring represented work groups under single collective bargaining agreements. The process for combining work groups begins with the union filing a petition with the National Mediation Board (NMB), at which point the NMB performs a review to assess a ‘single carrier determination’ for the airlines. Following this single carrier determination, the NMB makes a representation determination depending on size of the pre-merger bargaining units and will either extend the certification if one is significantly larger than the other or require a vote. Once representation is determined, the NMB certifies the union as the bargaining representative for the work group. The parties must also work together to achieve agreed upon single collective bargaining agreements. Integration also requires the pre-merger work groups to agree upon and finalize integrated seniority lists. As of December 31, 2018, four of our five unionized groups at Alaska have joint collective agreements and integrated seniority lists in place. This is a major milestone just 24 months after the official close of the acquisition of Virgin America in December 2016. A tentative agreement reached with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) was rejected by Boeing technicians. We will continue to work with AMFA and our technicians to reach a transition agreement.
At December 31, 2018, labor unions represented 84% of Alaska’s, 45% of Horizon’s, and 87% of McGee Air Services' employees. 
Our relations with U.S. labor organizations are governed by the Railway Labor Act (RLA). Under the RLA, collective bargaining agreements do not expire but instead become amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the NMB to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in self-help.

REGULATION

GENERAL

The airline industry is highly regulated, most notably by the federal government. The Department of Transportation (DOT), the the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the FAA exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.
 16



• | DOT: A domestic airline is required to hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT in order to provide passenger and cargo air transportation in the U.S. Subject to certain individual airport capacity, noise and other restrictions, this certificate permits an air carrier to operate between any two points in the U.S. Certificates do not expire, but may be revoked for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders or the terms of the certificates. While airlines are permitted to establish their own fares without government regulation, the DOT has jurisdiction over the approval of international codeshare agreements, marketing alliance agreements between major domestic carriers, international and some domestic route authorities, Essential Air Service market subsidies, carrier liability for personal or property damage, and certain airport rates and charges disputes. International treaties may also contain restrictions or requirements for flying outside of the U.S. and impose different carrier liability limits than those applicable to domestic flights. The DOT has been active in implementing a variety of “consumer protection” regulations, covering subjects such as advertising, passenger communications, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delay response. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the DOT from time to time for alleged violations of consumer protection and other economic regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | FAA: The FAA, through Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs), generally regulates all aspects of airline operations, including establishing personnel, maintenance and flight operation standards. Domestic airlines are required to hold a valid air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. Pursuant to these regulations, we have established, and the FAA has approved, our operations specifications and a maintenance program for each type of aircraft we operate. Each maintenance program provides for the ongoing maintenance of the relevant aircraft type, ranging from frequent routine inspections to major overhauls. From time to time, the FAA issues airworthiness directives (ADs) that must be incorporated into our aircraft maintenance program and operations. All airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the FAA from time to time for alleged violations of FARs or ADs. At this time, we are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.


• | TSA: Airlines serving the U.S. must operate a TSA-approved Aircraft Operator Standard Security Program (AOSSP), and comply with TSA Security Directives (SDs) and regulations. Under TSA authority, we are required to collect a September 11 Security Fee of $5.60 per one-way trip from passengers and remit that sum to the government to fund aviation security measures. Airlines are subject to enforcement actions that are brought by the TSA from time to time for alleged violations of the AOSSP, SDs or security regulations. We are not aware of any enforcement proceedings that could either materially affect our financial position or impact our authority to operate.

The Department of Justice and DOT have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters. The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services. Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act. To the extent we continue to fly to foreign countries and pursue alliances with international carriers, we may be subject to certain regulations of foreign agencies and international treaties.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY MATTERS

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, OSHA, and other federal agencies have been authorized to create and enforce regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under these federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations. We maintain our safety, health and environmental programs in order to meet or exceed these requirements.
In the future there may be legislation to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions. Over the course of several years, we have transitioned to more fuel-efficient aircraft fleets and reduced our emissions with the goal of continuing that trend.
The Airport Noise and Capacity Act recognizes the rights of airport operators with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as they do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Authorities in several cities have established aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews. We believe we have sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions.

Although we do not currently anticipate that these regulatory matters, individually or collectively, will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, new regulations or compliance issues that we do not currently anticipate could have the potential to harm our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods.
 17

INSURANCE
We carry insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts deemed adequate to protect our interests and property and to comply both with federal regulations and certain credit and lease agreements. The insurance policies principally provide coverage for Airline Hull, Spares and Comprehensive Legal Liability, War and Allied Perils, and Workers’ Compensation. In addition, we currently carry a Cyber Insurance policy in the event of security breaches from malicious parties. 
We believe that our emphasis on safety and our state-of-the-art flight deck safety technology help to control the cost of our insurance.
