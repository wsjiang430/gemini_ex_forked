Pursuant to the terms of the Cancellation Agreement, Mr. Dawei Li and Mr. Yunfei Li agreed to cancel the Debts in exchange for 3,431,373 and 1,666,667 shares of common stock of the Company, respectively (collectively, the “Shares”) at an exchange price of $1.02 per share. Upon receipt of the Shares, the creditors released the Company from any claims, demands and other obligations relating to the Debts. The Cancellation Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the creditors. The creditors do not have registration rights with respect to the Shares.


In the meanwhile, due to the growing environmental pollution problem, the Chinese government has been providing vigorous support to the development of new energy facilities and vehicles for several years. It is expected that we will be able to secure more potential orders from the new energy market, especially from the electric car market. We believe that with the booming market demand in high power lithium ion products, we can continue as a going concern and return to profitability.
 
In 2015, to promote the development of electric vehicles industry, the Chinese central government issued a subsidy policy named Notice of 2016-2020 New Energy Vehicles Promotion with Financial Support, which regulated subsidies for consumers in purchase of electric vehicles from central government and local government. According to the policy, it regulates a certain subsidy standard for various types of electric vehicles in connection with the endurance mileage, battery pack energy density, energy consumption level, which means new energy vehicles providing long driving range and high technical performance will get higher subsidies. For the purposes of establishing a long-term mechanism for the administration of energy conservation and new energy vehicles, and promoting the sound development of the automobile industry, Chinese government reduced the subsidy standard for electric vehicles once a year while made several other policies to stimulate the increase of new energy vehicles. On December 26, 2017, the Chinese central government issued a policy for exemption of purchase tax for electric vehicles for another three years until 2020.


On September 28, 2017, Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology issued a new policy named Measures for Parallel Administration of the Average Fuel Consumption and New Energy Vehicle Credits of Passenger Vehicle Enterprises (Measures for Parallel Administration). According to the Measures for Parallel Administration, Chinese government will calculate and examine the Average Fuel Consumption Credits and New Energy Vehicle Credits of passenger vehicle enterprises. If the enterprises get negative credits on the declaration day, the production of high-fuel consumption vehicles will be suspended. The positive credits of average fuel consumption of passenger vehicle enterprises may be carried forward or transferred among affiliated enterprises. A passenger vehicle enterprise’s negative credits of new energy vehicles shall be subject to compensation and zeroing through purchasing positive credits of new energy vehicles. Accordingly, the automobile industry should produce more new energy vehicles or pay money to other enterprises to get positive credits if their credits are negative. The Measures for Parallel Administration became effective on April 1, 2018.


We believe these policies in the long term will result in a healthy development of the new energy vehicles market as a whole. However, in the short term many electric vehicle manufacturers are inevitably adversely impacted by the decreasing subsidy, and the price of EV batteries in Chinese market decreased sharply as a result. Given the adverse market environment, we focused our resources on the existing cylindrical batteries for UPS market and temporarily reduce the investment on R&D of new products for electric vehicle market and cut down the EV batteries selling before the market stabilizes.
 
In September 2018, we transferred a patented proprietary high capacity prismatic battery technology, which we had been developing since 2017, to BAK Shenzhen, with a consideration of RMB85,144,500 (approximately $12.8 million).

Our Corporate History and Structure 
 
We conduct our current business through the following two wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China that we own through BAK Asia, a holding company formed under the laws of Hong Kong, and a 90% owned subsidiary of CBAK Power, one of our wholly-owned operation subsidiaries in China:

● | CBAK Trading, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on August 14, 2013, focuses on the wholesale of lithium batteries and lithium batteries’ materials, import & export business and related technology consulting service; and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | CBAK Power, located in Dalian, China, incorporated on December 27, 2013, focuses on the development and manufacture of high-power lithium batteries. 
● | CBAK Suzhou, located in Suzhou, China, incorporated on May 4, 2018, focuses on the development and manufacture of new energy high power battery packs. 

 
Almost all of our business operations are conducted primarily through our Chinese subsidiaries. The chart below presents our current corporate structure:
 

Our Products 
 
The use of new materials have enabled the configuration of high-power lithium battery cells to contain much higher energy density and higher voltage and have a longer life cycle and shorter charge time than other types of lithium-based batteries. These special attributes, coupled with intrinsic safety features, are suitable for batteries used for high-power applications, such as electric cars, electric bicycles, electric tools, energy storage and uninterruptible power supply, or UPS.
 
We believe high power lithium batteries represent the main direction of the development of new energy vehicle technologies according to the “13th Five-Year Plan” published by the Chinese government.
 
Our Dalian manufacturing facilities focus on the development and manufacture of high power lithium batteries, for use in the following end applications:
 

Battery Cell Type | End applications* 
---------------------------+--------------------------------------
High-power lithium battery | Electric bus [6,000-20,000]

Key High Power Lithium Battery Applications 
 
End-product applications that are driving the demand for high power lithium batteries include electric vehicles, such as electric cars, electric buses, hybrid electric cars and buses; light electric vehicles, such as electric bicycles, electric motors, sight-seeing cars; and electric tools, energy storage, uninterruptible power supply, and other high power applications.
Electric Vehicles
 
An electric vehicle, sometimes referred to as an electric drive vehicle, uses one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles include electric cars, electric buses, electric trains, electric lorries, electric airplanes, electric boats, and hybrid electric vehicles, plug in hybrid electric vehicles and electric spacecraft. Electric cars and electric buses are propelled by one or more electric motors powered by rechargeable battery packs. Electric cars and buses have the potential to significantly reduce city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions. Electric cars and buses are also expected to have less dependence on oil. World governments are pledging significant funds to fund the development of electric vehicles and their components due in part to these advantages. Due to these factors and a lithium battery’s relatively environmentally-friendly, light-weight and high-capacity features, the demand for lithium batteries in the field of electric cars and buses is increasing.
 
Due to such recent trends as renewed concerns relating to the availability and price of oil, increased legal fuel-efficiency requirements and incentives, and heightened interest in environmentally-friendly or “green” technologies, hybrid electric vehicles are likely to continue to attract substantial interest from vehicle manufacturers and consumers. Hybrid electric vehicles include automobiles, trucks, buses, and other vehicles that combine a conventional propulsion system with a rechargeable energy storage system to achieve better fuel economy than conventional vehicles. As these vehicles tend to be large and heavy, their rechargeable energy storage system generally consists of a large quantity of rechargeable high-power lithium cells.
 
The year 2014 was seen as the first real year for the development of China’s new energy vehicle industry by many industry insiders. After explosive growth in 2017, the production and sales of new energy vehicles continued to grow tremendously in 2018. According to Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China (“MIIT”), from January to December 2018, the production of new energy vehicles in China reached 1,270,000 units - up 43.4 percent year-on-year; and sales in China reached 1,256,000 units - up 61.7 percent year-on-year. As the core mechanism for new energy vehicles, the power battery industry has also recently welcomed an unprecedented growth. According to the Development Program for the Energy Efficient and New Energy Vehicle Industry 2012-2020 designed by the State Council of the PRC, some major objectives are: to enthusiastically advance innovation in power battery technologies; scientifically plan the industrial layout; focus on developing power battery industry clusters; and actively promote the mass production of power batteries. With the recent introduction of a number of supporting policies, the production of power batteries for vehicles has grown remarkably.
 
Light Electric Vehicles
 
Light electric vehicles include bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles, with rechargeable electric motors. Due to their relatively small size and light design, approximately 10-150 high-power lithium cells can be used to power light electric vehicles. The electric bicycle market in China is huge.
Energy Storage
 
Energy storage mainly means storage of electric energy by battery, inductor, and capacitor. Battery energy storage is mainly used for storage of emergency supply, battery car, and redundant energy of power plants.
Electric Tools
 
Electric tools such as drills, saws and grinders are used for both commercial and personal use. Due to high power requirements, many electric tools have historically used small combustion engines, used heavier nickel metal hydride batteries or relied on external power sources. Manufacturers of electric tools, such as Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., the Bosch Group, Metabowerke GmbH and Rigid Tool Company have begun to use lithium-ion technology. The market for portable high-powered electric tools is rapidly growing and has prompted many users, both commercial and personal, to replace or upgrade their current power tools.

Uninterruptible Power Supplies (“UPS”)
 
A UPS provides emergency power from a separate source when utility power is not available. The most common type of battery used in UPS is Sealed Lead-Acid, however, due to the lithium battery’s relatively small size, light design and environmentally-friendly features, the demand for lithium batteries in this industry is increasing.
Revenue by Products
 
Before June 30, 2014, we derived our revenues from BAK International and its subsidiaries which produced prismatic cells, cylindrical cells, lithium polymer cells and high-power lithium batteries. Since July 1, 2014, our revenue has been mainly from Dalian CBAK Power for sale of batteries manufactured by BAK Tianjin under outsourcing arrangements. Starting from October 2015, we generated revenues from high-power lithium battery cells manufactured by Dalian CBAK Power as well as batteries outsourced from BAK Tianjin, BAK Shenzhen and other manufacturers. The following table sets forth the breakdown of our net revenues by product types:

 | Fiscal Years ended |

Sales and Marketing
 
We plan to build an extensive sales and service network in China, highlighted by our presence in the regions where China’s main EV and LEV productions is located, such as Beijing, Shandong Province, Guangdong Province, Sichuan Province and three provinces in Northeast China. We intend to gradually establish post-sales service offices in these areas to serve brand owners and pack manufacturers in each designated area as currently our marketing department at headquarters is responsible for our promoting efforts. In doing so, our sales staff works closely with our customers to understand their needs and provide feedback to us so that we can better address their needs and improve the quality and features of our products.
 
We also engage in marketing activities such as attending industry-specific conferences and exhibitions to promote our products and brand name. We believe these activities are conducive in promoting our products and brand name among key industry participants.
 
Suppliers
 
The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries include electrode materials, cases and caps, foils, electrolyte and separators. Cost of these raw materials is a key factor in pricing our products. We believe that there is an ample supply of most of the raw materials we need in China. We are seeking to identify alternative raw material suppliers to the extent there are viable alternatives and to expand our use of alternative raw materials.
 
We aim to maintain multiple supply sources for each of our key raw materials to ensure that supply problems with any one supplier will not materially disrupt our operations. In addition, we strive to develop strategic relationships with new suppliers to secure a stable supply of materials and introduce competition in our supply chain, thereby increasing our ability to negotiate better pricing and reducing our exposure to possible price fluctuations.

We believe that we are able to leverage our low-cost advantage to compete favorably with our competitors. Compared to Korean and Japanese battery makers, we are able to source our needs for skilled labor and raw materials locally and economically. Compared to Chinese battery makers, we believe we have higher consistency and safety in product quality, which enables us to compete favorably with local competitors.
 
Research and Development 
 
The R&D of next-generation advanced lithium battery and its key materials – characterized by high energy density, high security, long-lasting life, and low cost – as well as the training of related technical talents, have become a major demand in the development of advanced electric vehicles in China. We have reached strategic cooperation agreements with Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics of Chinese Academy of Sciences (“DICP”), Dalian Maritime University and Dalian Jiaotong University. Under the agreements, these institutions and us will jointly research and develop the next-generation key technologies and materials with an aim to produce the most powerful battery worldwide.
 
We have an advanced R&D center in Dalian, receiving almost all the R&D achievements, R&D equipment and staff of BAK Tianjin. BAK Tianjin began its R&D manufacturing and distribution of high-power lithium battery and battery modules in December 2006, for use in electric cars, electric bicycles, UPS, and other applications.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
As we conduct our manufacturing activities in China, we are subject to the requirements of PRC environmental laws and regulations on air emission, waste water discharge, solid waste and noise. The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. We aim to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We have built environmental treatment facilities concurrently with the construction of our manufacturing facilities, where waste air, waste water and waste solids we generate can be treated in accordance with the relevant requirements. We outsource our disposal of solid waste we generate in the Dalian facility to a third party contractor. Certain key materials used in manufacturing, such as cobalt dioxide, electrolyte and separators, have proven innocuous to worker’s health and safety as well as the environment. We are not subject to any admonitions, penalties, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we are named as a defendant for violation of any environmental law or regulation. We do not have any reasonable basis to believe that there is any threatened claim, action or legal proceedings against us that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
