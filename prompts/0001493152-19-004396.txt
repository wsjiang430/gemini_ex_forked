Overview of Our Business
 
Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc. is a global medical technology company focused on the design, development, and commercialization of a comprehensive portfolio of orthobiologics and spinal implants. Our products are used by orthopedic spine surgeons and neurosurgeons to treat a variety of spinal disorders in the cervical, thoracolumbar, and interbody spine.
Our Offices
 
Our headquarters and manufacturing facility are located at 664 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714. Our telephone number is (406) 388-0480. We also have two other facilities on the Montana campus, located at 600 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714, and at 732 Cruiser Lane, Belgrade, Montana 59714. All our properties are leased.
Our Corporate History
 
We began operations in 1998 as a spin out of the Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University, or the CBE, and incorporated as “Bacterin, Inc.” in the state of Montana in January 2000. Through a series of transactions and corporate events, we eventually became Bacterin International Holdings, Inc. (“Bacterin”), which on March 7, 2011, began trading our common stock on the NYSE Amex, now known as the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “BONE.”
 
On July 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of X-spine Systems, Inc. (“X-spine”) for approximately $60 million in cash, repayment of approximately $13 million of X-spine debt, and approximately 4.24 million shares (0.4 million shares post reverse split) of Xtant common stock. X-spine is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of implants and medical devices for use in orthopedic spinal surgeries. As a result of this transaction, X-spine became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bacterin International Holdings, Inc.

At the close of business on July 31, 2015, we changed our corporate name to “Xtant Medical Holdings, Inc.” On August 6, 2015, Xtant formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Xtant Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation to facilitate the integration of Bacterin and X-spine. On October 15, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE MKT under the ticker symbol “XTNT.” X-spine is engaged in the development, manufacturing and sale of implants and medical devices for use in orthopedic spinal surgeries. Xtant, Bacterin and X-spine are jointly referred to herein as the “Company”.
 
On May 8, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Aurora Management Partners Inc. (“Aurora”) to assist us in restructuring efforts. Pursuant to this agreement, David Baker served as Chief Restructuring Officer of the Company and certain additional Aurora personnel, referred to as Deputy Restructuring Officers, assisted in the restructuring efforts. As part of our restructuring, we completed a significant debt restructuring in the beginning of 2018 pursuant to which then outstanding indebtedness amounting to an aggregate of $76.6 million in principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest, was converted into shares of our common stock and we issued an additional 946 thousand shares of common stock to certain of our lenders in a private placement. As a result of this debt restructuring, ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (“ROS”) and OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities II, LP (“Royalty Opportunities” and together with ROS, our “lenders”), which are funds affiliated with OrbiMed Advisors LLC (“OrbiMed”), collectively own approximately 70% of our outstanding common stock. Although our agreement with Aurora terminated on November 8, 2018 and David Baker no longer serves as Chief Restructuring Officer, certain Aurora personnel continue to provide financial and accounting assistance to us under a separate agreement.
 
Industry and Market Overview
 
The orthopedic biomaterials market consists of materials that are organic, inorganic or synthetic in nature. These materials are implanted or applied in or near the indicated bone to facilitate healing, encourage bone tissue augmentation, compensate in areas where bone tissue is depleted and restore structure to allow for repair. Orthopedic biomaterials are capable of producing specific biological action or regenerative responses that are beyond what is observed in normal healing. These materials are often used as substitutes to autograft materials, which are taken from a harvest site in the patient to patch or repair the wounded or unhealthy site.
 
Fixation is often instrumental in allowing the body to heal and regenerate tissue. It provides the constructive support necessary for reestablishing stability, by immobilizing the regenerative site, and relieving stress. Fixation can also help hold the biomaterial in place in order to achieve a better outcome. Examples of fixation products can include, but is not limited to, plates, screws, pins, rods, spacers, and staples, and may be made from various metals and polymer materials.

Our Orthobiologics Products
 
Our biomaterial products include OsteoSponge®, OsteoSponge® SC, OsteoSelect® DBM putty, OsteoSelect Plus DBM putty, OsteoWrap®, OsteoSTX®, and our new line of 3Demin® products, as described below, as well as other allografts:

● | OsteoSponge is a form of demineralized bone matrix made from 100% human bone. Derived from trabecular (cancellous) bone, OsteoSponge provides a natural scaffold for cellular in-growth and exposes bone-forming proteins to the healing environment. The malleable properties of OsteoSponge enable it to conform to, and fill, most defects. Upon compressing the allograft, OsteoSponge springs back to completely fill the void. Its unique mechanical and biological properties make OsteoSponge an ideal bone graft for use in various orthopedic practices including spine, neurology, cranial/maxillofacial, trauma, plastic/reconstruction and general procedures where new bone growth is needed. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | OsteoSponge SC is a form of OsteoSponge designed to fill bony defects in the subchondral region of joints. We have received permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which is a Federal agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, to market this product as a subchondral bone void filler and are currently marketing it as such. 
● | OsteoSelect DBM Putty is engineered with the surgeon in mind. With outstanding handling characteristics, OsteoSelect is designed to be easily molded into any shape and compressed into bony voids. Bacterin has validated a low-dose, low-temperature gamma sterilization process to provide maximum osteoinductive potential while still affording device level sterility. Every production batch of OsteoSelect is tested for osteoinductive bone growth characteristics allowing us to make that unique marketing claim. 
● | OsteoSelect PLUS combines the exceptional cohesive characteristics of OsteoSelect DBM Putty with demineralized cortical chunks. OsteoSelect PLUS is designed to deliver differentiated handling properties and insure patient safety through validated, terminal sterilization. Each lot of OsteoSelect PLUS DBM is tested for osteoinductivity in vivo prior to being released. OsteoSelect PLUS is indicated as a bone void filler and bone graft substitute in the pelvis, extremities, and posterolateral spine. 
● | OsteoWrap is 100% human cortical bone demineralized through a proprietary process to make the graft flexible while maintaining allograft integrity. This product has various applications in orthopedic, neurological, trauma, oral/maxillofacial and reconstructive procedures. OsteoWrap can wrap around non-union fractures to assist with fusion, can act as a biologic plate or can be used in conjunction with a hardware plate system. Additionally, this product provides the surgeon with superior handling characteristics as the allograft can be easily sized using surgical scissors or a scalpel and will withhold sutures or staples for fixation. 
● | OsteoSTX are demineralized cortical sticks processed from human allograft bone. Utilizing our patented demineralization technology, the grafts are flexible and feature osteoinductive properties. The nature of demineralized cortical bone provides all the necessary elements for bone regeneration. OsteoSTX are designed for posterolateral spine surgery applications ranging from one-level to multi-level fusions, including scoliosis procedures. 
● | 3Demin is a family of allografts that maximizes osteoconductivity and the osteoinductive potential of human bone. They consist of 100% demineralized cortical bone with excellent, malleable handling characteristics, and are distributed as a sterile allograft. Bacterin’s 3Demin products are easily hydrated with any biocompatible liquid, making them an ideal option for various bone grafting applications. They are most commonly used in spinal fusion procedures. 

 
All of our biologics are terminally sterilized and packaged to enhance the safety of our grafts for our physician customers and their patients.

It is intended for spinal fusion procedures at one or two contiguous levels of the lumbosacral spine (L2 − S1 inclusive) in skeletally mature patients for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. 

Technology and Intellectual Property
 
We rely upon patents, trademarks, and trade secrets to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others.
Patents
 
Our policy is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries when we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. We do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent.
 
As of December 31, 2018, our fixation patent portfolio includes over 53 issued patents globally and 1 patent application pending, and our biologics patent portfolio includes over 14 issued patents globally and over 12 patent applications pending.
 
We expect that additional patent applications will be filed and prosecuted as inventions are discovered, technological improvements and processes are developed, and specific applications are identified. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain final approval of any patents.
 
Trademarks
 
We have registered, and continue to seek registration, of trademarks and continuously monitor and aggressively pursue users of names and marks that potentially infringe upon our registered trademarks. We currently own the following registered trademarks under the Bacterin name: OsteoSponge ®, OsteoVine ®, OsteoWrap ®, OsteoLock ®, BacFast ®, OsteoSelect ®, Elutia ®, OsteoSTX ®, hMatrix ®, 3Demin®, BACTERINSE ®, and Circle of Life ®. Under the X-spine name, we own the following registered trademarks: SILEX®, X-SPINE®, IRIX®, CAPLESS®, CERTEX®, CALIX®, H-GRAFT®, SPIDER, X90®, HYDRAGRAFT®, BUTREX®, FORTEX®, AXLE®, FIXCET®, Capless® and X-spine’s square design logo.
Trade Secrets
 
To safeguard our proprietary knowledge and technology, we rely upon trade secret protection and non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and third-party collaboration partners with access to our confidential information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will adequately protect against the unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or that third parties will not be able to independently develop similar technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any agreements concerning confidentiality and non-disclosure will not be breached, or if breached, that we will have an adequate remedy to protect us against losses. Although we believe our proprietary technology has value, because of rapid technological changes in the medical industry, we also believe that proprietary protection is of less significance than factors such as the intrinsic knowledge and experience of our management, advisory board, consultants and personnel and their ability to identify unmet market needs and to create, invent, develop and market innovative and differentiated products.

Donor Procurement
 
We have agreements with multiple recovery agencies, and we continue to expand our network for access to donor tissue in anticipation of increased demand. We expect to be able to continue to build our network for donor tissue as our processing capabilities and sales increase.
Sales and Marketing
 
We distribute our products in the United States through a distribution network of over 300 commissioned independent sales agents and stocking agents. We also maintain a national accounts program to enable our agents to gain access to independent health delivery network hospitals and through group purchasing organizations.
 
Our international footprint includes distribution partners in Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Australia, and certain Pacific region countries.
 
Competition
 
There are various public and private organizations that offer both, fixation and orthobiologics to their customers. The market is dominated by large competitors including Medtronic plc, Johnson and Johnson, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., Nuvasive, Inc., and Globus Medical, Inc. Together, we believe these large competitors have almost 80% market share. We compete with these larger competitors and several others including RTI Surgical, Inc., SeaSpine Holdings Corporation, OrthoFix Medical Inc., Alphatec Holdings, Inc., as well as dozens of privately-owned companies. We also compete with tissue banks that do not offer spinal fixation products, such as AlloSource International, Inc., LifeNet Health, and MTF Biologics.
Government Regulation
 
We are registered with the FDA as a manufacturer of human cellular and tissue products (“HCT/Ps”) as well as medical devices, and we are an accredited member in good standing of the American Association of Tissue Banks. We meet all licensing requirements for the distribution of HCT/Ps in states with licensing requirements, including Florida, California, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Oregon, and New York. Our industry is highly regulated, and we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our customers.
 
Our fixation products and instrumentation systems are regulated as medical devices and therefore are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, as well as by other domestic and international regulatory bodies. These regulations govern multiple activities that Xtant and suppliers, licensors and partners perform and will continue to perform. These regulated activities include product design and development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, safety, premarket clearance, advertising and promotion, product marketing, sales and distribution, post-market surveillance and post-market adverse event reporting. All products currently marketed by Xtant are regulated as HCT/Ps or have received 510(k) clearances.

Human Tissue
 
Human tissue products have been regulated by the FDA since 1993. In May 2005, three new comprehensive regulations went into effect that address manufacturing activities associated with HCT/Ps. The first requires that companies that produce and distribute HCT/Ps register with the FDA. The second provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate tissues and is referred to as the “Donor Eligibility” rule. The third rule governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule. Together, they are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and communicable disease transmission to recipients. Several of our products including OsteoSponge and OsteoWrap are regulated as HCT/Ps as determined by the Tissue Reference Group and regulated under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”) and 21 CFR Part 1271.
Medical Devices
 
Our medical devices require the clearance of the FDA prior to sale within the United States. The FDA process requires a premarket notification, or a 510(k) submission, to the FDA to demonstrate that the medical device is safe and effective and is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. Applicants must compare the device to one or more similar devices that are commercially available in the United States (known as the “predicate device”) and make and support a claim of substantial equivalency to such predicate device. Support for such claims must include descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data. In some cases, data from clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) submission. The FDA must then issue an order finding substantial equivalency before the devices may be commercially distributed in the United States. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health Division of the FDA governs HCT/Ps that are regulated as medical devices, including our OsteoSelect DBM putty.
 
The discussion of what data is needed is sometimes conducted in a formal process called the Pre-Submission process whereby companies meet with the FDA to discuss the data needed for clearance. If the FDA finds the applicant’s device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device, it will send a letter to the applicant stating that fact. This allows the applicant’s device to be commercially distributed in the United States. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health division of the FDA governs the clearance of conventional medical devices such as our spinal hardware as well as some of the HCT/Ps that are also regulated as medical devices, such as our OsteoSelect DBM putty.
 
Another procedure for obtaining marketing authorization for a medical device is the “de novo classification” procedure. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous premarket approval or “PMA” requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A company files for a de novo approval when it does not have a predicate to which it can claim substantial equivalence. Once a de novo application is reviewed and approved, it results in the device having a Class II status and future devices from the company or a competitor may use the company de novo-approved device as a 510(k) predicate. A de novo approval is reserved for Class II moderate risk devices and a company must show that special controls can be created which subsequent applicants can follow to obtain a 510(k) clearance. The advantage of the de novo approval is that it requires less data than a PMA. The disadvantage is that it may require more data than a 510(k) and most often will include human clinical data. FDA is increasingly moving devices with slightly different proposed indication statements or different technological features off the 510(k) path and on to the de novo path resulting in more time and expense for the company.

The process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k) or a PMA.
 
In the future, Xtant may decide to strategically commercialize products in the United States that would require a PMA, but there are no plans to do so at the present time. Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA.
 
International Regulation
 
Many foreign countries have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country or to obtain a CE Certificate of Conformity may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and the related requirements may differ. Some third-world countries accept CE Certificates of Conformity or FDA clearance or approval as part of applications of approval for marketing of medical devices in their territory. Other countries, including Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan, require separate regulatory filings.
 
To market our product devices in the member countries of the European Union, we are required to comply with the European Medical Device Directives and to obtain CE mark certification. CE mark certification is the European symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Device Directives. Under the European Medical Device Directives, all medical devices must qualify for CE marking. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to one of our products, a recognized European Notified Body must assess our quality systems and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the European Medical Device Directives. We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements. In March 2019, our Notified Body informed us that we are at risk of losing our CE mark on several products for failing to comply with post market clinical follow up requirements. We are working with our Notified Body to remediate this nonconformance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate this matter on a timeline that is satisfactory to the Notified Body. If this risk were to materialize, we may be required to remove the effected products from the EU market countries until remediation is complete.
 
The new European MDR intended to replace the current Medical Device Directives came into force May 2017. Manufacturers of approved medical devices will have until May 2020 to transition their devices to meet the requirements of the MDR. After May 2020, manufacturers are offered a grace period which further extends the transition time for some medical devices. We are currently reviewing our product portfolios, quality system and processes in an effort to meet the new regulations within the timeframes we are afforded, although no assurance can be provided that we will be able to do so. Our failure to meet these new regulations would cause us to lose our CE mark certification.
 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
 
Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to Xtant’s business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal health care programs, such as by Medicare or Medicaid. The concerns that the Anti-Kickback Statute addresses are multiple, but primary among them are, first, that the federal government pays/reimburses health care providers for the true acquisition cost of goods and services provided to patients served by government programs. The government does not want, for example, health care providers obtaining manufacturer discounts which are not disclosed to the government on cost report forms submitted for reimbursement to the government. The government wants to be the beneficiary of such discounts. Second, for that reason, the government wants transparency in the billing process which discloses such discounts to the government. Third, the government does not want purchasing, prescription or referral decisions for medical devices biased by economics unrelated to the best choices for a patient.
 
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. Remunerative relationships with physicians in which manufacturers give health care providers gifts or pay for entertainment, sporting events, trips or other perquisites, may be viewed as an attempt to buy loyalty to the manufacturer’s products. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs as well as any third-party payors, including commercial insurers.
 

11
--

 

Further, federal legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively “PPACA”), among other things, clarified the intent requirements of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. Specifically, a person or entity can be found to have violated the statutes without actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the PPACA amended the Social Security Act to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Recent amendments to the Federal False Claims Act provide that a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is also a violation of the Federal False Claims Act, subjecting healthcare entities to treble damages and mandatory penalties for each false claim or statement.
 
Additionally, the civil Federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The purpose of the Federal False Claims Act is to prevent manufacturers from causing or inducing inappropriate prescriptions leading to an inappropriate government reimbursement. It often comes into play where a manufacturer suggests or assists a health care provider to bill for an off-label, uncovered use. It also can occur when the reimbursement advice given by a manufacturer results in inappropriate reimbursement claims from “upcoding,” miscoding, “stretched” coding, the use of inappropriate modifiers or inappropriate care settings. These behaviors can result in the government paying for products or procedures that should not be reimbursed by the federal government. The manufacturer must be truthful and not misleading in the reimbursement advice it gives to customers.
 
Actions under the Federal False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the Federal False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the Federal False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare companies throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices, as well as federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the Federal False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
 
The Federal False Claims Act amendments in 2009 and 2010 expanded the scope of the liability for health care entities generally to potentially reach violations of regulatory duties, such as good manufacturing practices. There have been large settlements in the life sciences arena related to FDA regulatory violations for promotional activities and good manufacturing practice.
 
Even in instances where a company may have no actual liability, the Federal False Claims Act private citizen provisions (qui tam) allow the filing of Federal False Claims Act actions under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the United States Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit.
 
Federal False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the health industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim or statement. Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, health care companies resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may awarded in litigation proceedings. They may be required, however, to enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs to companies to ensure compliance.

The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (including physician family members) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians. A manufacturer’s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year, and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for “knowing failures.” Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements.
 
If a governmental authority were to conclude that Xtant is not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Xtant and its officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. Our United States operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). We are required to comply with the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded United States corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of “off books” slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Xtant’s currently approved products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in spinal and orthopedic surgery and if covered by third-party payors, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Accordingly, healthcare providers in the United States generally rely on third-party payors, principally private insurers and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of a spine surgery in which Xtant products are used. Sales volumes and fees for Xtant products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. Third-party payors perform analyses on new technologies to determine if they are medically necessary before providing coverage for them. These third-party payors may still deny reimbursement on covered technologies if they determine that a device used in a procedure was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Particularly in the United States, third-party payors continue to carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products.
 
In the United States, a large percentage of insured individuals receive their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs pay their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month and, consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use Xtant products.
 
The overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will likely continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. Government or private third-party payors cannot be guaranteed to cover and reimburse the procedures using Xtant products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. In addition, it is possible that future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will adversely affect the demand for Xtant products or the ability to sell them on a profitable basis.
 
Internationally, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary substantially from country to country and include single-payor, government-managed systems as well as systems in which private payors and government managed systems exist side-by-side. Xtant’s ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using company products under the healthcare payment systems in such markets. A number of countries may require Xtant to gather additional clinical data before recognizing coverage and reimbursement for its products.
