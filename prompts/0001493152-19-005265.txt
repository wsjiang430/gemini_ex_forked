Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on November 29, 2011, under the name Quatra-Rad, Inc. and our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our two directors. On February 29, 2012, we amended our Certificate of Incorporation to change our name to Quarta-Rad, Inc. On July 16, 2012, we amended and restated its Certificate of Incorporation to increase its authorized shares of common stock to 50,000,000, $0.0001 par value from 1,500, no par value and effected a 10,000 to 1 forward split. On February 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to our Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation to correct it for inadvertently excluding the 10,000 to 1 forward stock split, which our shareholders and directors approved on June 29, 2012. From November 29, 2011 (inception) through May 2012, we had limited operations. Commencing in May 2012, we began sales and implemented our business plan to distribute detection devices, including but not limited to Geiger counters, to homeowners and interested customers in North America by selling them on consignment on behalf of a related party owned by our majority shareholder and which are purchased from a company owned by our minority shareholder. We also purchase the products directly from the company owned by our minority shareholder and sell them to independent third party resellers. A Geiger counter is an instrument used for measuring ionizing radiation. It detects radiation such as Beta particles, Gamma rays and X-rays using the ionization produced in a Geiger–Müller tube, which gives its name to the instrument. We do not currently manufacture any of the products that we sell. We intend to continue to target homebuilders and home renovation contractors for the sale of products and resellers that market to these customers. Our business activities are now focused on expanding our Internet sales. We have established a fiscal year end of December 31. Initially we sold the products on consignment on behalf of Star Systems Corporation, a Japanese company owned by Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder, and purchase products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., a Russian company owned by Alexey Golovanov, our minority shareholder, which we sell to independent third party resellers. Commencing in 2013, we began selling the products directly to third parties through Internet sales.

On November 29, 2011, we issued 1,500 pre-split shares of our no par value common stock, valued at $1 per share, to our 2 founders, which includes 1,200 pre-split common shares to our chief executive officer, Victor Shvetsky and 300 pre-split common shares to our president, Alexey Golovanov in exchange for organizational services incurred in our formation valued at $1,200 and $300, respectively. We believe that our present capital is sufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. However, we believe that we will require between $75,000 to $310,000 in cash in 2019 to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation (See Item 7). To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, then we intend to use our existing cash or raise additional capital from investors through the sale of our common stock or from loans or advances from our majority shareholder. Our majority shareholder has orally agreed to advance us the funds without interest and has agreed to defer repayment until we are able to repay him. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we raised $65,230 from 34 investors through the issuance of our common stock pursuant to our registration statement. No additional funds were raised in 2017 or 2018.
 
Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801-1186 and our telephone number is (302) 887-9916 and email contact is info@quartarad.com. Our URL address is www.quartarad.com.
 
Business
 
We commenced operations in May 2012, by selling products on consignment from a company owned by our majority shareholder. In 2012, we purchased products from a company owned by our minority shareholder and sold them to a company owned by our majority shareholder and to third party resellers. We believe the terms of those sales were arms-length. In 2012, we began use of the Internet as well as the services of an independent sales representative to market the products to homeowners and interested customers in North America and the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties. We market the products to homebuilders and home renovation contractors. We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources. In 2011, our operations were devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities as well as related party and third party sales, which included:

1. | Formation of the Company; 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Development of our business plan; 
3. | Evaluating various detection devices; 
4. | Research on marketing channels/strategies for our detection devices and the industry; 
5. | Secured our website domain www.quartarad.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and 
6. | Research on future products to distribute. 
7. | Consignment sales on behalf of a related party. 
8. | Sales to third party resellers. 

 
In May 2012, we commenced our business operations by selling products on consignment from a related party company and developing our distribution network. In June 2012, we began to utilize our website to market the products we sell on consignment to our potential customers. We also began implementing our business plan by promoting these products for sale on various websites. We also engaged independent, third party distributors to sell the products. In 2013, increased our Internet presence and increased our sales whereby the majority of our sales were from unrelated third parties. From 2014 to the present, we have continued to sell the products through the Internet to unrelated third parties. During 2018, our ability to sell through our distributor in the UK was suspended due to an ongoing UK VAT examination, we are currently exploring new partners for EU distribution.
 
We believe that our principal source of revenue will continue to come from Internet sales and sales to resellers of the following products:
 
Radiation Detection Equipment
 
RADEX RD1503 – basic model of a hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market.
 
RADEX RD1706 – enhanced model of a hand-held radiation detector; additional radiation counter provides for a more accurate results (confirmed by JQA – Japan Quality Assurance organization), vibration alarm and several additional functions improve on the RD1503 design specifications.
 
RADEX RD1008 – high-end radiation detection device that provides readings for Gamma- and Beta- radiation values separately. Equivalent devices from other manufacturers cost 5-10 times more.
 
RADEX RD1212 – new model of hand-held radiation detector for the consumer market. It includes all the functionality of RD1503 model as well as ability to store measured values in memory for later transfer to PC. This device comes with newly developed software, RadexRead, developed by Quarta-Rad Inc to further enhances the RADEX family of Geiger counters by combining the power of PC and Internet, allowing the user to visualize and share their measurements with other RADEX consumers.
 
RADEX RD1212-BT – upgraded version of RD1212 with Bluetooth, now capable of linking to smartphones or tablets to transfer data in real time. Also measures atmospheric pressure and air temperature. Special Android/iOS application for smartphones can be used alongside with this product.
 
RADEX RD ONE – compact personal radiation detector, smaller and less expensive than any of the other models. Besides the size, the device has additional features such as: counts accumulative dose, can display measurements in CPMs and links via USB cord to PC for data transfer and analysis. Other standard features include audio/vibration alarm and adjustable alarm thresholds like on all other models. New analytical software was created to chart and analyze received data.

Radon Detection Equipment
 
RADEX MR106N – Radon gas detector with digital read-out of the results (in volume of air); readings calculated every 4 hours and saved in the onboard memory log.
 
RADEX M107 – simple Radon gas detector that provides visual/audio alarm when a certain (or legal) threshold is reached.
 
EMI Detection Equipment
 
RADEX EMI50 – hand-held device that provides real-time measuring of Electric Field Strength (in kiloVolt/meter) and Electro Magnetic Field (in microTesla).
 
Light and brightness Detection Equipment
 
RADEX Lupin – Light Meter, Pulse meter and Lucimeter. A hand-held device that measure illumination, brightness and flicker ratio of LED screens, any type of light bulbs or monitors at work or at home. RadexLight Software allows PC connection and data transfer. Spectral sensitivity is identical to a human eye, which separates this model from the competition.
 
Although we have commenced our marketing sales campaign with our own resources and are selling products through online retailers and through resellers, we believe that we need additional capital to increase our sales and expand our marketing program. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to cost effectively purchase and sell the products and market them through the Internet and through distributors. We intend to rely on our Chairman and President’s relationships in the industry to supply us with products and introduce us to resellers. We also intend to market our website to the home renovation industry to solicit orders for the sale of products. There can be no guarantee or assurance that our Chairman or President and/or our website will enable us to purchase products on attractive terms that will allow us to resale them to independent third party distributors.
 
No assurance can be given that the products we purchase will be sold to resellers and, if sold to them, will return an investment or make a profit. To achieve the goal of purchasing products on favorable terms, we plan to be selective in our choice of suppliers and work with our shareholders’ companies as well as other cost-effective suppliers.
 
Major advantages that can be capitalized on immediately are:
 

● | existing brand recognition of RADEX name; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | existing product line up that can be sold now; 
● | access to device library that are in the prototyping stage for a quicker push into production and sales phases; 
● | access to Quarta-Rad, Ltd. engineers and its proprietary tech library that would allow for quick prototyping and manufacture of devices based on reports from the field sales-force; and 
● | Exclusive distribution rights for the RADEX brand in the United States, Canada and the European Union 



Quarta-Rad, Ltd.’s proprietary tech library is combination of source code, database, firmware and hardware used for measuring and displaying radiation measurements. The source code is for the: (i) RD1212 web program; (ii) RD1212 BT application for Android and iPhone; (iii) Web RadexRead; and (iv) database of radiation measurements. The Web RadexRead and database of radiation measurements are owned, managed, and controlled by us. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns and controls the firmware source code used by all Radex series as well as the hardware design. Victor Shvetsky, our CEO, is in charge of developing and maintaining any technical libraries we own. Quarta-Rad, Ltd. owns any technical library components.
 
Financing Strategy
 
Our ability to increase our inventory will depend on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall inventory planning and management will rest with our management. For each detection device product, we plan to purchase, management will need to assess the market and our financing needs to acquire product at cost-effective prices. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever purchase product on cost-effect terms or employ independent distributors to effectively sell the products.
 
Once we determine our inventory needs, there are various methods of obtaining the funds needed to complete the purchase of the detection devices. Examples of financing alternatives include the assignment of our rights to purchase order financing. Alternatively, we may form a limited liability company or partnership where we will be the managing member or the general partner and raise funds to finance inventory. We may also obtain favorable pre-sales commitments from various customers such as home restoration contractors, distributors and developers. These various techniques, which are commonly used in the industry, can be combined to finance our inventory without a major bank financing.

Distribution Arrangements
 
Effective distribution is critical to the economic success of the detection devices, particularly when made by a small company without sufficient marketing resources. We have negotiated a few independent distribution agreements.
 
We intend to continue to distribute the products in the United States through existing independent distributors and the Internet. Our primary emphasis will be on marketing to homebuilders, home renovation contractors and general contractors. In addition, we intend to also target direct consumers via the Internet through online retailers and through national and regional retailers.
 
To the extent that we may engage in distribution of the products in foreign markets, we will be subject to all of the additional risks of doing business abroad including, but not limited to, government censorship, currency fluctuations, exchange controls, greater risk of “piracy” copying, and licensing or qualification fees.
 
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the nature of the distribution arrangements, if any, that we may secure for the detection devices we sell.
 
We believe that the catastrophic events such as the March 11, 2011 nuclear accident in Japan will drive consumers and the market to radiation detection devices and other detection devices will either be in demand from the construction community and will be cost effective for the consumer and the industry professional.
 
We believe that effective Internet advertising along with participation in trade shows is the quickest and most cost effective method to let consumers know about the products. Additionally, large resellers and distributors will require promotional packages that we will need to develop and produce.
 
Competition
 
The detection device industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as United Technologies Corporation, Radiation Alert, Osun Technologies, Lutron, General Tools, Mazur Instruments, First Alert, Inc./BRK Brands, Inc., which is wholly owned by Sunbeam Corporation, as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us.
 
The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of customer service, the quality of finished products and price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality finished products depends primarily on our manufacturers’ standards and the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver the Products we sell. We believe we will compete effectively in all of these areas.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer detection devices at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to obtain more experienced employees than we can.
 
Intellectual Property Rights
 
We do not currently have any intellectual property rights. In the summer of 2013, Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director developed a software program called RadexRead, which Quarta-Rad, Ltd is using in the manufacture of its RD1212 products that we purchase as party of our inventory. We are not incurring any additional costs or benefits from Mr. Shvetsky’s ownership of this software and, there are no current plans for Mr. Shvetsky to sell the software to the Company or contribute it for additional shares of our common stock.
Status Of Any Publicity Announced New Products And Services
 
In late 2013, we began distributing a new product named RD1212, which we believe has a sleek new design. It has the ability to store measurements in internal memory and transfer this data to a personal computer (“PC”). The RadexRead software utilized in this device allows users to view values retrieved from the Geiger counter, map them on Google Maps, and share their data with other Radex users.

We estimate that the cost for us to purchase software from an independent party that performs the same functions as RadexRead would be approximately $30,000. This software allows us to retrieve data from the RD1212 device to a Windows PC, analyze it, and geo-tag the values and place them on Google Map. The software offers an interactive view of the world map with readings other Radex RD1212 users can, at their option, submit.
 
We believe RadexRead brings numerous advantages to us over our competition, specifically:
 

● | RadexRead distinguishes the products we sell from other Geiger counters in its price range by providing free visualization software; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | RadexRead, to the best of our knowledge, is the only software for Geiger counters in the RD1212 price range that allows users to mark radiation values collected by Geiger counters and place them on a map; 
● | RadexRead is the only software in this Geiger counter class that allows users to share their data with each other over the Internet; 
● | RadexRead is designed for use by users with little or no scientific background, making it simple and fun to collect, visualize and share radiation measurements with the community; and 
● | RadexRead allows us to further increase its visibility through collaboration with Safecast, a worldwide volunteer organization that collects radiation data. RadexRead gives user an option of saving data online and submit its radiation and geographical data shared with other users to Safecast monitoring network. 

 
We believe RadexRead has increased RADEX’s appeal over our competition and helped RD1212 become one of our top selling Geiger counters, despite the product’s manufacturer’s suggested retail price being almost forty percent higher than the previous top-selling device, the low-cost RD1503.
 
Our Website
 
Our website is located at www.quartarad.com and provides a description of our company, the products we sell and our contact information including our address, telephone number and e-mail address.
Trademarks And Patents
 
We do not have any registered trademarks or patents.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applied to businesses, such as payroll taxes on the state and federal levels. Sales of the products we sell on consignment or sell to independent, third party distributors and services we may provide internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control. Violations of export control rules could result in suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation. Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts. We believe that we are in conformity with all applicable laws in the states we conduct business and the United States.
Research and Development
 
From our inception through September 30, 2014, we have not spent any money on research and development activities. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we have begun spending money on research and development for a new software program that we may license to others and $155,000 to our related party supplier for the development of a new product for us to sell. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we spent approximately $95,000, $59,000 and $4,000, respectively, on research and development with our related party. We have paid an independent contractor to improve and upgrade our website and Victor Shvetsky, our majority shareholder and director, has developed, at no cost to us, a software program called RadexRead, which we allow Quarta-Rad, Ltd. to use in the manufacture of the RD1212 products we purchase from them. We also entered into an agreement with our related party developer for $180,000 to develop software for the device RADEX AQ.
Employees
 
Presently, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors who devote their time as needed to our business and expect to devote 10 hours per week.
