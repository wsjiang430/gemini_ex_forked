Overview
 
Electromed, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Electromed” or the “Company”) develops, manufactures, markets and sells innovative products that provide airway clearance therapy, including the SmartVest® Airway Clearance System (“SmartVest System”) and related products, to patients with compromised pulmonary function with a commitment to excellence and compassionate service. Our goal is to make High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (“HFCWO”) treatments as effective, convenient, and comfortable as possible, so our patients can breathe easier and live better with improved respiratory function and fewer exacerbations.
 
We employ a direct-to-patient and provider model, through which we obtain patient referrals from clinicians, manage insurance claims on behalf of our patients, and deliver the SmartVest System to patients, training them on proper use in their homes. This model allows us to directly approach patients and clinicians, whereby we disintermediate the traditional durable medical equipment (“DME”) channel and capture both the manufacturer and distributor margins. We also sell our products in the acute care setting for patients in a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were admitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance. Electromed was incorporated in Minnesota in 1992. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American under the ticker symbol “ELMD.”
 
The SmartVest System features a programmable air pulse generator, a therapy garment worn over the upper body and a connecting hose, which together provide safe, comfortable, and effective airway clearance therapy. The SmartVest System generates HFCWO, an airway clearance therapy. One factor of respiratory health is the ability to clear secretions from airways. Impaired airway clearance, when mucus cannot be expectorated, may result in labored breathing and/or inflammatory and immune systems boosting mucus production that invites bacteria trapped in stagnant secretions to cause infections. Studies show that HFCWO therapy is as effective an airway clearance method for patients who have compromised pulmonary function as traditional chest physical therapy (“CPT”) administered by a respiratory therapist. However, HFCWO can be self-administered, relieving a caregiver of participation in the therapy, and eliminating the attendant cost of an in-home care provider. We believe that HFCWO treatments are cost-effective primarily because they reduce a patient’s risk of respiratory infections and other secondary complications that are associated with impaired mucus transport and often result in costly hospital visits and repeated antibiotic use.
 
The SmartVest System is designed for patient comfort and ease of use which promotes adherence to prescribed treatment schedules, leading to improved airway clearance, patient outcomes, a reduction in healthcare utilization and quality of life. We offer a broad range of garments, referred to as vests and wraps, in sizes for children and adults that allow for tailored fit. User-friendly controls allow patients to administer their daily therapy with minimal or no assistance. Our direct product support services provide patient and clinician education, training, and follow-up to ensure the product is integrated into each patient’s daily treatment regimen. Additionally, our reimbursement department assures we are working on behalf of the patient by processing their physician paperwork, providing clinical support and billing the applicable insurance provider. We believe that the advantages of the SmartVest System and the Company’s customer services to the patient include:
 

● | improved quality of life; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduction in healthcare utilization; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | independence from a dedicated caregiver; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | consistent treatments at home; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improved comfort during therapy; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | eligibility for reimbursement by private insurance, federal or state government programs or combinations of the foregoing.

Our Products 
 
Since 2000, we have marketed the SmartVest System and its predecessor products to patients suffering from bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). Our products are sold into the home health care market and the acute care setting for patients in a post-surgical or intensive care unit, or who were admitted for a lung infection brought on by compromised airway clearance. Accordingly, our sales points of contact include adult pulmonology clinics, cystic fibrosis centers, neuromuscular clinics and hospitals.
 
We have received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market the SmartVest System to promote airway clearance and improve bronchial drainage. In addition, Electromed is certified to apply the Conformité Européenne (“European Conformity” or “CE”) marking for HFCWO device sales in all European Union countries and approved for HFCWO device sales in other, select international countries. The SmartVest System is available only with a physician’s prescription.
 
The SmartVest System is currently available in two models – SV2100 and SQL® – both of which are sold into home care and hospital markets. We are in the process of phasing out the SmartVest SV2100 product but will support and service SV2100 pursuant to the product warranty.
 
As part of our growth strategies, we periodically evaluate opportunities involving products and services, especially those that may provide value to the respiratory homecare and institutional market.
 
The SmartVest SQL System
 
The SmartVest SQL System consists of an inflatable therapy garment, a programmable air pulse generator and a patented single-hose that delivers air pulses from the generator to the garment. The SmartVest SQL is designed for maximum comfort and lifestyle convenience, so patients can readily fit therapy into their daily routines. The SmartVest SQL was designed significantly smaller, quieter, and lighter than its predecessor, and offers features that make it easier to use and enable greater patient freedom.
 

● | Patented single-hose design: A single-hose delivers oscillations to the SmartVest garment, which we believe provides therapy in a more comfortable and unobtrusive manner than a two-hose system. Oscillations are delivered evenly from the base of the SmartVest garment, extending the forces upward and inward in strong but smooth cycles surrounding the chest. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Open system design with active inflate – active deflate: The active inflate – active deflate mechanism of the SmartVest System provides patients a more comfortable treatment experience by allowing them to take deep breaths and breathe more easily without feeling restricted. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Soft-fabric garment is lightweight and comfortable: The SmartVest garment is lightweight and designed to resemble an article of clothing. Quick fit Velcro®-like closures allow for a secure, comfortable fit without bulky straps and buckles. The simple design creates a broad size adjustment range to ensure a properly tailored fit to accommodate pediatric and adult patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patented Soft Start® and 360° garment oscillation coverage: Soft Start gently fills the garment to acclimate the patient to therapy and minimize “vest creep.” All SmartVest garments provide 360° oscillation coverage, which delivers simultaneous treatment to all lobes of the lungs. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Smaller, quieter and lighter: The SmartVest SQL System is 25% smaller, 5db quieter and 30% lighter than the SmartVest SV2100. The SmartVest SQL is the lightest and overall quietest HFCWO generator on the market, weighing less than 16 pounds, making it easier for patients to use and integrate HFCWO therapy into their daily lives. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Programmable generator with user-friendly device operation: The SmartVest SQL features multiple operating modes, including ramp, and options for saving, locking and restoring protocols. Further, an enhanced pause feature allows the physician to program dedicated time(s) for the patient to clear secretions. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
SmartVest Connect 
 
In June 2017, we launched the SmartVest SQL with SmartVest Connect® wireless technology, a personalized HFCWO therapy management portal for patients with compromised pulmonary function. The SmartVest SQL with wireless technology features built-in cellular connectivity, offering healthcare teams and patients access to treatment information to better collaborate in making patient-centered care decisions. SmartVest Connect is available to pediatric and cystic fibrosis patients, and targeted adult pulmonary clinics using a wirelessly enabled SmartVest SQL system. We expect to launch SmartVest Connect with Bluetooth™ technology and supporting mobile applications in fiscal 2020.
 
Other Products
 
We market the Single Patient Use (“SPU”) SmartVest and SmartVest Wrap® to health care providers in the acute care setting. Hospitals issue the SPU SmartVest or SmartVest Wrap to an individual patient for managing airway clearance. Both SPU products provide full coverage oscillation and facilitate continuity of care because they introduce the patient to our product and may encourage use of the SmartVest System for home care, which can be provided to patients with a chronic condition upon discharge.
 
Distribution of the Aerobika® Oscillating Positive Expiratory Pressure (“OPEP”) device, a drug-free, hand-held device with a proprietary pressure-oscillation dynamic that provided intermittent resistance and created positive pressure and oscillations simultaneously, in the U.S. home care market, which was effectuated through a distributor agreement with Monaghan Medical Corp., was discontinued in November 2018.
 
Our Market
 
We estimate the total served U.S. market for HFCWO in 2018 was approximately $180 million to $200 million. We believe our business model is supported by many market trends related to an aging population and growing awareness by physicians of diseases and conditions for which patients can benefit from using HFCWO therapy. Indications for when HFCWO may be prescribed are not specific to any one disease. A physician may elect to prescribe HFCWO when he or she believes the patient will benefit from improved airway clearance and external chest manipulation is the treatment of choice to enhance mucus transport and improve bronchial drainage.
 
The SmartVest System is prescribed for patients with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, and neuromuscular conditions such as cerebral palsy and ALS. We believe that bronchiectasis represents the fastest growing diagnostic category and greatest potential for HFCWO growth in the United States. Bronchiectasis is an irreversible, chronic lung condition characterized by enlarged and permanently damaged bronchi. The condition is associated with recurrent lower respiratory infections, inflammation, reduction in pulmonary function, impaired respiratory secretion clearance, increased hospitalizations and medication use, and increased morbidity and mortality.
 
We are driven to make life’s important moments possible – one breath at a time by leading the HFCWO therapy market in clinical evidence that supports the therapeutic imperative of clearing excess mucus from the lungs. Electromed is the only HFCWO therapy company with multiple published clinical outcome studies demonstrating a significant improvement in quality of life and reduction in exacerbation rates, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and antibiotic prescriptions in bronchiectasis patients using SmartVest.1-4 Leading in clinical evidence to support SmartVest as a treatment for bronchiectasis patients will remain a focus in fiscal 2020.
 
We believe that bronchiectasis is under recognized and underdiagnosed but is experiencing a surge in clinical interest and awareness, including the relationship to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), commonly referred to as bronchiectasis COPD overlap syndrome (“BCOS”). The overlap of bronchiectasis and COPD increases exacerbations and hospitalizations, reduces pulmonary function, and increases mortality. Several recent studies have estimated prevalence of bronchiectasis, which we believe are helpful for estimating a range of the market size.
 

● | Aksamit (2017) found 20% (n=350) of patients with bronchiectasis enrolled in the U.S. Bronchiectasis Research Registry (“BRR”) between 2008 and 2014 also had COPD and 29% (n=515) also had asthma.1 Other studies have found that the overlap between bronchiectasis and COPD is currently observed in 27% to 57% of patients with COPD. 6–8 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Chalmers (2017) found that prevalence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD ranged from a low of 4% to as high as 69% with mean prevalence of 54%. In many studies in patients with COPD, the presence of bronchiectasis was associated with reduced lung function, greater sputum production, more frequent exacerbations and increased mortality versus those with COPD alone.9 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seitz (2012) estimated that 190,000 unique cases of bronchiectasis were diagnosed in Medicare patients in 2007 and bronchiectasis prevalence increased 8.7% annually between 2000 and 200710. Based on historic growth in prevalence and assuming a constant growth rate, the estimated number of bronchiectasis diagnoses in 2018 exceeded 470,000. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Weycker (2017) projected 4.2 million adults in the United States over 40 years may have bronchiectasis, suggesting there is a large pool of patients with undiagnosed disease.11 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These studies indicate a wide range of potential prevalence of bronchiectasis patients from a low of 470,000 to as high as 4.2 million patients in the United States. We also believe that it is difficult to estimate from these studies which patients will need or benefit from HFCWO. The U.S. BRR indicated 15% of the patients included in the registry were prescribed HFCWO as part of their treatment plan. Using that study data, we estimate that, within the diagnosed Medicare population of 470,000, approximately 15% or 70,000 have been prescribed HFCWO. We believe that bronchiectasis is underdiagnosed in the U.S. based on clinical study evidence. We also believe that HFCWO is under prescribed for bronchiectasis patients. By applying approximately 15% HFCWO penetration of diagnosed Medicare patients to the Weycker clinical study to the estimated 4.2 million prevalence of bronchiectasis in the U.S., we derived that the HFCWO opportunity may be 630,000 forecasted units. (See Figure 1).
 
Estimated HFCWO Market Opportunity - Bronchiectasis Patients (U.S.) – Figure 1
 


The heightened awareness of bronchiectasis speaks to the growing body of clinical evidence supporting treatments to improve symptoms and manage disease progression. In 2019, an observational comparative retrospective cohort study published in BMC Pulmonary Medicine evaluated the efficacy of a treatment algorithm in 65 patients with radiographic and symptom confirmed bronchiectasis, centered on initiation of HFCWO therapy with the SmartVest System.4 Patients were treated per the algorithm if they reported greater than two exacerbations in the previous year and symptoms, including chronic cough, sputum production, or dyspnea. Results show that at one-year: exacerbations requiring hospitalization and antibiotic use were significantly reduced, and mean FEV1 remained stable post enrollment, suggesting early initiation of HFCWO therapy may slow the otherwise normal progression of the disease.

Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our products and services with physicians, clinicians, patients, and third-party payers. Because the sale of the SmartVest System requires a physician’s prescription, we market to physicians and health care providers as well as directly to patients. The vast majority of our revenue comes from domestic home care sales through a physician referral model. We have established our own domestic sales force, which we believe is able to provide superior education, support and training to our customers. Our direct U.S. sales force works with physicians and clinicians, primarily pulmonologists, in defined territories to help them understand our products and services and the value they provide to their respective patients. As of June 30, 2019, we had 40 field sales employees, including four regional sales managers, 34 clinical area managers (“CAMs”) and two clinical educators. We also have developed a network of approximately 250 respiratory therapists and health care professionals across the U.S. to assist with in-home SmartVest patient training on a non-exclusive independent contractor basis. These independent contractors are credentialed by the National Board for Respiratory Care as either Certified Respiratory Therapists or Registered Respiratory Therapists.
 
Of the $30.6 million of our revenue derived from the U.S. in our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 (“fiscal 2019”), approximately 95% represented home care and 5% represented hospital sales. Due to readmission penalties associated with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as reconciled by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the “PPACA”), for certain diseases and conditions including COPD and pneumonia, we believe opportunities for further growth exist for HFCWO therapy because the device used by a patient in a hospital may influence the choice of device prescribed at discharge. We expect to achieve future sales, earnings, and overall market share growth with increasing home care referrals by educating and building awareness of diseases and conditions that may benefit from HFCWO, like bronchiectasis, with physicians and patients and the value of the SmartVest System’s differentiated features and benefits.
 
We generate sales leads through multiple channels that include visits to pulmonology clinics and medical centers, participation in medical conferences, maintenance of industry contacts to increase the visibility and acceptance of our products by physicians and health care professionals, participation with patient organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as well as through patients by word of mouth and traffic to our website and social media channels. We continue to evaluate opportunities to offer the SmartVest System through selected Home Medical Equipment (“HME”) distributors. We entered into agreements with two HME distributors, one national and one regional, to distribute and sell the SmartVest system in the United States home care market. The Company expects to continue its direct sales channel as its primary homecare revenue source. Sale of the SmartVest system through HME distributors has begun in targeted geographies in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

The addition of an HME distribution network would expand our access to physicians and hospitals in certain areas of the United States and would be expected to support our other growth strategies. In addition, we place advertisements in leading medical magazines and journals.
 
Additionally, because the availability of reimbursement is an important consideration for health care professionals and patients, we must also demonstrate the effectiveness of our products to public and private insurance providers. The availability of reimbursement exists primarily due to an established Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) code for HFCWO. A HCPCS code is assigned to services and products by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Because our product has an assigned HCPCS code, a claim can be billed for reimbursement using that code.
 
International Marketing 
 
Approximately 2.4% and 1.8% of our net revenues were from sales outside the U.S. in our fiscal 2019 and our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”), respectively. We sell our products outside the U.S. primarily through independent distributors specializing in respiratory products. Through June 30, 2019, the majority of our distributors operated in exclusive territories. Our principal distributors are located in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Europe, Southeast Asia, and South and Central America. Units are sold at a fixed contract price with payments made directly from the distributor, rather than being tied to reimbursement rates of a patient’s insurance provider as is the case for domestic sales. Our sales strategy outside the U.S. is to focus our corporate resources on maintaining our current distributors with less emphasis on contracting with new distributors.
 
Third-Party Reimbursement
 
In the U.S., individuals who use the SmartVest System generally will rely on third-party payers, including private payers and governmental payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of using the SmartVest System. Our homecare revenue comes from reimbursement from commercial payors, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs and direct patient payments. Reimbursement for HFCWO therapy and the SmartVest System varies among public and private insurance providers.
 
A key strategy to grow sales is achieving world class customer service and support for our patients and clinicians. We do this with an established and effective reimbursement department working on behalf of the patient by processing physician paperwork, seeking insurance authorization and processing claims. The skill and knowledge gained and offered by our reimbursement department is an important factor in building our revenue and serving patients’ financial interests. Our payment terms generally allow patients to acquire the SmartVest System over a period of 1 to 15 months, which is consistent with reimbursement procedures followed by Medicare and other third parties. The payment amount we receive for any single referral may vary based on a number of factors, including Medicare and third-party reimbursement processes and policies. The patient retains the risk of reimbursement to the Company in the event of non-payment by third-party payers.
 
Our SmartVest System is reimbursed under HCPCS code E0483. Currently, the Medicare total allowable amount of reimbursement for this billing code is approximately $12,000. The allowed amount for state Medicaid programs range from approximately $8,000 to $12,000, which is similar to commercial payers. Actual reimbursement from third-party payers can vary and can be significantly less than the full allowable amount. Deductions from the allowable amount include co-payments, deductibles and/or maximums on durable medical equipment, decrease the reimbursement received from the third-party payer. Collecting a full allowable amount depends on our ability to obtain reimbursement from the patient’s secondary and/or supplemental insurance if the patient has additional coverage, or our ability to collect amounts from individual patients.
 
Most patients are able to qualify for reimbursement and payment from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance or combinations of the foregoing. We expect that subsequent generations of HFCWO products also will qualify for reimbursement under Medicare Plan B and most major health plans. However, some third-party payers must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. In addition, we face the risk that new or modified products could have a lower reimbursement rate, or that the levels of reimbursement currently available for our existing products could decrease, which would hamper our ability to market and sell that product. Consequently, our sales will continue to depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, even though our devices may have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. The manner in which reimbursement is sought and obtained varies based upon the type of payer involved and the setting in which the procedure is furnished.

Research and Development
 
Our R&D capabilities consist of full-time engineering staff and several consultants. We periodically engage consultants and contract engineering employees to supplement our development initiatives. Our team has a demonstrated record of developing new products that receive the appropriate product approvals and regulatory clearances around the world.
 
During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we incurred R&D expenses of approximately $583,000 and $251,000, or 1.9% and 0.9% of net revenues, respectively. As a percentage of sales, we expect spending on R&D expenses to remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”) as compared with fiscal 2019 with engineering resources focusing on next generation product enhancements and other market opportunities, including SmartVest Connect with Bluetooth technology and supporting mobile applications.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
As of June 30, 2019, we held 17 U.S. and 25 foreign issued patents covering the SmartVest System and its underlying technology and had 19 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. These patents and patent applications offer coverage in the field of air pressure pulse delivery to a human in support of airway clearance. One of our foreign patents will expire during fiscal 2020.
 
We generally pursue patent protection for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices in foreign countries that we have identified as key markets for our products. These markets include the European Union, Canada, Japan, and other countries.
 
We also have received ten U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, one registration in each of Canada, Peru and Japan, one pending international registration and one through the Madrid Protocol for India.
 
Manufacturing 
 
Our headquarters in New Prague, Minnesota includes a dedicated manufacturing and engineering facility of more than 10,000 square feet and we are certified on an annual basis to be compliant with ISO 13485 quality system standards. Our site has been audited regularly by the FDA and the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), in accordance with their practices, and we maintain our operations in a manner consistent with their requirements for a medical device manufacturer. While components are outsourced to meet our detailed specifications, each SmartVest System is assembled, tested, and approved for final shipment at our manufacturing site in New Prague, consistent with FDA, Underwriters Laboratory, and ISO standards. Many of our vendors are located within 100 miles of our headquarters, which enables us to closely monitor our component supply chain. We maintain established inventory levels for critical components and finished goods to assure continuity of supply.
Product Warranties
 
We provide a warranty on the SmartVest System that covers the cost of replacement parts and labor, or a new SmartVest System in the event we determine a full replacement is necessary. For home care SmartVest Systems initially purchased and currently located in the U.S. and Canada, we provide a lifetime warranty to the individual patient for whom the SmartVest System is prescribed. For sales to institutions within the U.S., and for all international sales, except Canadian home care, we provide a three-year warranty.

Competition
 
The original HFCWO technology was licensed to American Biosystems, Inc. (now Advanced Respiratory, Inc. (“ARI”), part of Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc.), which, until the introduction of our original MedPulse Respiratory Vest System® in 2000, was the only manufacturer of a product with HFCWO technology cleared for market by the FDA (ARI’s The Vest® Airway Clearance System). ARI has also received FDA 510(k) clearance for the Monarch™ Airway Clearance System, a mobile device that uses pulmonary oscillating discs. Respiratory Technologies, Inc., doing business as RespirTech, received FDA clearance to market their HFCWO product, the inCourage® Airway Clearance Therapy. In August 2017, Royal Phillips acquired RespirTech. Both ARI and RespirTech employ a direct-to-patient model, and recently Royal Phillips announced plans to offer its HFCWO device through selected HME distributors.
 
The AffloVest® (the “AffloVest”) from International Biophysics Corporation (“IBC”) also participates in the same market as our SmartVest System. IBC received FDA 510(k) clearance for its device in 2013. IBC primarily sells its device through DME companies who distribute home care medical devices and supplies. Clinical and cost-effective evidence, technology innovations, including wireless connectivity, and HFCWO product features and benefits, such as size, weight of the generator, reputation for patient and reimbursement services, and sales effectiveness of field personnel, have become the key drivers of HFCWO product sales.
 
Alternative products for administering pulmonary therapy include: Positive Expiratory Pressure; OPEP; Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation; CPT and breathing techniques. Physicians may prescribe some or all of these devices and techniques, depending upon each patient’s health status, severity of disease, compliance, or personal preference. We believe our primary competitive advantages over alternative treatments are patient comfort, ease of use, and the effectiveness of HFCWO treatment. Because HFCWO is not “technique dependent,” as compared to most other pulmonary therapy products, therapy begins automatically once power is provided and remains consistent and controlled for the duration of treatment.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
Medicare and Medicaid
 
Recent government and private sector initiatives in the U.S. and foreign countries aim at limiting the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, and are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices that result in better clinical outcomes. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement the program will pay for particular procedures or treatments, restricting coverage for certain products or services, and implementing other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Many private insurance programs look to Medicare as a guide in setting coverage policies and payment amounts. These initiatives have created an increasing level of price sensitivity among our customers.
Home Medical Equipment Licensing
 
Although we do not fall under competitive bidding for Medicare, we often must satisfy the same licensing requirements as other DME providers that qualify for competitive bidding. In response to out-of-state businesses winning the competitive bidding process, which had a significant impact on small local DME businesses, many states have enacted regulations that require a DME provider to have an in-state business presence, specifically through state HME licensing boards or through state Medicaid programs. In order to do business with any patients in the state or to be a provider for the state Medicaid program, a DME provider must have an in-state presence. In addition to Minnesota, our corporate headquarters, we have a licensed in-state presence in four other states. In-state presence requirements are different from state to state, but generally require a physical location that is staffed and open during regular business hours. We are licensed to do business in all states except for Hawaii.
Product Regulations
 
Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices, and compliance with these laws and regulations entails significant costs for us. Our regulatory and quality assurance departments provide detailed oversight in their areas of responsibility to support required clearances and approvals to market our products.
 
 8

 

In addition to the clearances and approvals discussed below, we obtained ISO 13485 certification in January 2005 and receive annual certification of our compliance with ISO quality standards.
 
FDA Requirements
 
We have received clearance from the FDA to market our products, including the SmartVest System. We may be required to obtain additional FDA clearance before marketing a new or modified product in the U.S., either through the 510(k) clearance process or the more complex premarket approval process. The process may be time consuming and expensive, particularly if human clinical trials are required. Failure to obtain such clearances or approvals could adversely affect our ability to grow our business.
 
Continuing Product Regulation
 
In addition to its approval processes for new products, the FDA may require testing and post-market surveillance programs to monitor the safety and effectiveness of previously cleared products that have been commercialized and may prevent or limit further marketing of products based on the results of post-mark surveillance results. At any time after marketing clearance of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) requirements and/or current medical device reporting regulations. Product approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial market clearance. The failure to comply with regulatory standards or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims.
 
We must register annually with the FDA as a device manufacturer and, as a result, are subject to periodic FDA inspection for compliance with the FDA’s QSR requirements that require us to adhere to certain extensive regulations. In addition, the federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. We also must maintain certain certifications to sell products internationally, and we undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications.
 
Advertising and marketing of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. Competitors and others also can initiate litigation relating to advertising and /or marketing claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved or uncleared claim of use, we may need to modify our training or promotional materials or be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions that may result in civil fines or criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they determine that our promotional or training materials constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties.
 
European Union and Other Regions
 
European Union rules require that medical products receive the right to affix the CE marking, demonstrating adherence to quality standards and compliance with relevant European Union Medical Device Directives. Products that bear CE marking can be imported to, sold or distributed within the European Union. We obtained clearance to use CE marking on our products in April 2005. Renewal of CE marking is required every five years, and our notified body performs an annual audit to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. We have maintained our CE marking in good standing since originally receiving it and most recently renewed it in January 2015. We also require all of our distributors in the European Union and other regions to comply with their home country regulations in our distributor agreements.

The 2010 Healthcare Reform Legislation, medical device excise tax and Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act
 
U.S. healthcare reform legislation (“PPACA”), was enacted into law in March 2010. The PPACA imposes a 2.3% excise tax on certain domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers. To the extent that third-party payers and institutions will not absorb increased costs represented by the tax because of reimbursement or contract limitations, we are not able to offset the tax with increased revenue.
 
Beginning with the third quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we realized a positive impact to operating profit with the adoption of the recent Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which includes a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax effective as of January 1, 2016.
 
On May 22, 2018, we concluded an examination with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) related to federal medical device excise taxes paid on revenue associated with our sales of the SmartVest during our tax periods ended June 30, 2014 through December 31, 2015. As a result, it was determined the SmartVest was eligible for the retail exemption from the medical device excise tax, resulting in the IRS agreeing to a refund of approximately $406,000. This refund was recognized in fiscal 2018 results and full payment was received in July 2018. Furthermore, we expect we will be exempt from the medical device tax after the conclusion of the current two-year medical device tax moratorium, which is scheduled to end on December 31, 2019.
 
Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
 
The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Section 6002 of the PPACA, the “Sunshine Act”) was adopted on February 1, 2013, to create transparency for the financial relationship between medical device companies and physicians and/or teaching hospitals. The Sunshine Act requires all manufacturers of drugs and medical devices to annually report to the CMS any payments or any other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, including but not limited to consulting fees, grants, clinical research support, royalties, honoraria, and meals. This information is then posted on a public website so that consumers can learn how much was paid to their physician by drug and medical device companies. The Sunshine Act requires ongoing data collection and annual management and reporting by us.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal health care laws apply to the marketing of our products and when we or our customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally-funded health care programs. The principal applicable federal laws include:

● | the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits offers to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of inducing or rewarding referrals of items or services reimbursable by a federal health care program; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Stark Law, which prohibits physicians from profiting (actually or potentially) from their own referrals. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs and private third-party payers. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. Enforcement of all of these regulations has become increasingly stringent, particularly due to more prevalent use of the whistleblower provisions under the False Claims Act, which allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties and disbarment from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.

HIPAA/HITECH and Other Privacy Regulations
 
Federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restrict the use and disclosure of such information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) set forth privacy and security standards that govern the use and disclosure of protected electronic health information by “covered entities”, which include healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. Because we provide our products directly to patients and bill third-party payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance companies, we are a “covered entity” and must comply with these standards. Failure to comply with HIPAA/HITECH or any state or foreign laws regarding personal data protection may result in significant fines or penalties and/or negative publicity. In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA/HITECH, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA/HITECH. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
 
The HIPAA/HITECH health care fraud and false statement statutes also prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other medical device companies, our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily manufacturing, sterilization, and disposal processes. We do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
Employees
 
As of June 30, 2019, we had 119 employees. Twelve of our employees were respiratory therapists licensed by appropriate state professional organizations, including all the employees in our Patient Services Department. We also retain approximately 250 respiratory therapists and health care professionals on a non-exclusive independent contractor basis to provide training to our customers in the U.S. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
