Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 We are one of the largest specialty molecular diagnostic laboratories in the world and since our founding in 1992, have tested over 3.0 million patients. We are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah and generated worldwide revenues of $851.1 million during our fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We are a leading precision medicine company acting as a trusted advisor to transform patient lives through pioneering molecular diagnostics. Through our proprietary technologies, we believe we are positioned to identify important disease genes, the proteins they produce, and the biological pathways in which they are involved to better understand the genetic basis of human disease. We believe that identifying these biomarkers (DNA, RNA and proteins) will enable us to develop novel molecular diagnostic tests that can provide important information to solve unmet medical needs.
Our Mission
 Our goal is to provide physicians with critical information to guide the healthcare management of their patients by addressing four major questions a patient may have about their healthcare: 

• | What is the likelihood of my getting a disease?
--+------------------------------------------------


• | Do I have a disease?
--+---------------------


• | How aggressively should my disease be treated?
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | Which therapy will work best to treat my disease?
--+--------------------------------------------------

 Over time, we have developed and plan to develop additional products that answer these important questions in six medical specialties:  oncology, women’s health, urology, dermatology, autoimmune and neuroscience.  We believe that these commercial channels represent markets where there is a significant opportunity for high-value molecular diagnostic tests to positively impact patient care and drive value for the healthcare system.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our strategy is focused on executing the following five critical success factors:
  
1. | Build upon a solid hereditary cancer foundation - In fiscal year 2019, approximately 56 percent of our revenue was derived from the sale of products to assess a patient’s risk for hereditary cancer. Given that this is our most important market and that we are the worldwide leader in hereditary cancer testing, we are focused on maintaining this global leadership position. We are currently working on expanding professional guidelines for hereditary cancer testing to expand the addressable market, and have signed long-term contracts with commercial insurers to ensure pricing visibility going forward. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Grow new product volume – In fiscal year 2019, volume from new products outside of hereditary cancer comprised greater than two-thirds of our overall volume. We are currently less than 10 percent penetrated in the U.S. market with our new products and see significant opportunity for future revenue growth. We are focused on further penetrating these markets and believe in the future our new products could represent the largest component of our revenue.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Expand reimbursement coverage for new products – In the United States, insurance coverage of our new tests range from 5% to 90% of the applicable total addressable market. We are actively working on demonstrating scientific evidence supporting both the clinical efficacy and utility of these products to commercial payors to broaden insurance coverage.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Increase international contribution – Outside of the United States, our first priority is selling kit-based versions of our RNA expression based tests. We currently market one RNA expression based test, EndoPredict, which we acquired through our acquisition of Sividon Diagnostics GmbH. In addition, we are working on kit based versions of Prolaris and myPath Melanoma which we also plan to sell in international markets. In addition, we are providing companion diagnostics and have obtained regulatory approvals in Japan.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Improve profitability – In the fourth-quarter of fiscal year 2017 we launched a new operating margin improvement program called Elevate 2020. The goal of this program is to identify projects that can lead to $50 million in incremental operating income by fiscal year 2020 through leveraging centralized resources, implementing new technology solutions, executing strategic sourcing agreements, and focusing on laboratory efficiency.

Molecular Diagnostic Testing
 Our molecular diagnostic tests are designed to analyze genes, their expression levels and corresponding proteins to assess an individual’s risk for developing disease later in life, accurately diagnose disease, determine a patient’s likelihood of responding to a particular drug, or disease recurrence and assess a patient’s risk of disease progression.  Provided with this valuable information, physicians may more effectively manage their patient’s healthcare.
 Below are the descriptions of our molecular diagnostic tests:
  
• | myRisk™ Hereditary Cancer: DNA sequencing test for assessing the risks for hereditary cancers. Our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test represents the next generation of our existing hereditary cancer testing franchise which we anticipate will eventually replace our current predictive medicine test offerings (BRACAnalysis, BART, Colaris and Colaris AP, and Melaris) with a single comprehensive test. myRisk Hereditary Cancer is designed to determine a patient’s hereditary cancer risk for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, uterine cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer. The test analyzes 35 separate genes to look for deleterious mutations that would put a patient at a substantially higher risk than the general population for developing one or more of the above cancers. All 35 genes in the panel are well documented in clinical literature for the role they play in hereditary cancer and have been shown to have actionable clinical interventions for the patient to lower disease risk or risk of cancer recurrence. The myRisk report presents the myRisk Genetic Test Result and myRisk Management Tool that summarizes published management guidelines related to the patient’s genetic mutation as well as their personal and family history of cancer. myRisk Hereditary Cancer testing identifies more mutation carriers than BRACAnalysis® and COLARIS® combined. We believe the global market for myRisk Hereditary Cancer and all of our hereditary cancer tests is approximately $5 billion annually. myRisk Hereditary Cancer was initially released through an early access launch that began in September 2013. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BRACAnalysis®: DNA sequencing test for assessing the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. Our BRACAnalysis test is an analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for assessing a woman’s risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. A woman who tests positive for a deleterious mutation with the BRACAnalysis test has up to an 87% risk of developing breast cancer and up to a 44% risk of developing ovarian cancer by age 70. As published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers have shown that pre-symptomatic individuals who have a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer can reduce their risk by more than 90% with appropriate preventive therapies. Additionally, BRACAnalysis may be used to assist patients already diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer and their physicians in determining the most appropriate therapeutic interventions to address their disease.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | riskScoreTM: clinically validated personalized medicine tool that enhances our myRisk Hereditary Cancer test. The riskScore test is clinically validated to predict a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer using family history, clinical risk factors and genetic markers. The proprietary algorithm combines proprietary single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and clinical factors to provide women with assessments of their remaining lifetime risk and 5-year risk of developing breast cancer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BRACAnalysis CDx TM: DNA sequencing test for use as a companion diagnostic for use in identifying ovarian and HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA variants eligible for treatment with U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved PARP inhibitors. Approximately 15% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and 10% of metastatic breast cancer patients are BRCA positive. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | GeneSight®: DNA genotyping test to aid psychotropic drug selection for depressed patients. GeneSight® is for use by health-care professionals seeking patient-specific information on gene-drug interactions when contemplating an alteration in neuropsychiatric medication for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are suffering with refractory moderate to very severe depression after at least one prior neuropsychiatric medication failure. Because genes influence the way a person’s body responds to specific medications, the medications may work differently for each person. Using DNA gathered with a simple cheek swab, GeneSight analyzes a patient’s genes and provides individualized information to help healthcare providers select medications that better match the patient’s genes. Multiple clinical studies have shown that when clinicians used GeneSight to help guide treatment decisions, patients were more likely to respond compared to standard of care. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Vectra®: protein quantification test for assessing the disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis. Our Vectra test is a quantitative, objective multi-biomarker blood test validated to measure rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity. Vectra assesses multiple mechanisms and pathways associated with RA disease activity and integrates the concentrations of 12 serum proteins into a single score reported on a scale of 1 to 100. The test may be used throughout the course of a patient’s disease and provides clinicians with expanded insight on disease severity and the risk of radiographic progression. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the global market for Vectra is approximately $3 billion annually. 
  
• | Foresight®: Foresight is a prenatal test for future parents to assess their risk of passing on a recessive genetic condition to their offspring. The test screens for 175 serious and clinically actionable conditions. The test has been shown to have a detection rate of 99% across all ethnicities. Studies have shown that with prior knowledge of recessive genetic conditions, 76% of patients took preventive actions such as in-vitro fertilization with pre-implantation genetic testing to reduce the risk of having an affected offspring. We believe the global market for Foresight is approximately $4B annually.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prequel TM: Prequel is a non-invasive prenatal screening test conducted using maternal blood to screen for severe chromosomal disorders in a fetus. The test uses whole genome sequencing to test for trisomies and monosomies in all 23 chromosomal pairs including the sex chromosomes along with microdeletions associated with common genetic diseases. Prequel has a low test failure rate at less than 1 in 1,000 patients and has been validated in multiple clinical studies to be highly accurate. We believe the global market for Prequel is approximately $4B annually.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prolaris®: RNA expression test for assessing the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. Our Prolaris test is a gene expression assay that assesses whether a patient is likely to have a slow growing, indolent form of prostate cancer that can be safely monitored through active surveillance, or a more aggressive form of the disease that would warrant aggressive intervention such as a radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The Prolaris test was developed to improve physicians’ ability to predict disease outcome and to thereby optimize patient treatment. A study published by Urologic Oncology in June 2018 demonstrated that Prolaris can identify 50% more patients as being suitable for active surveillance without any change in prostate cancer mortality. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the global market for Prolaris is approximately $1.5 billion annually.  
  
• | EndoPredict®: RNA expression test for assessing the aggressiveness of breast cancer. The EndoPredict test is a next-generation RNA expression test used to determine which women with breast cancer would benefit from chemotherapy. EndoPredict predicts the likelihood of metastases to help guide treatment decisions for chemotherapy and extended anti-hormonal therapy. EndoPredict has been shown to accurately predict recurrence in Her 2-, ER+, node negative and node positive breast cancer patients with no confusing intermediate results in 13 published clinical studies with more than 2,200 patients and is CE marked. We believe the global market for EndoPredict is approximately $600 million annually. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | myPath TM Melanoma: RNA expression test for diagnosing melanoma. Our myPath Melanoma test is a gene expression based profile that is performed on biopsy tissue for the purpose of aiding a dermatopathologist in the diagnosis of melanoma. Every year in the United States, there are approximately two million skin biopsies performed specifically for the diagnosis of melanoma. Approximately 14% of these biopsies are classified as indeterminate where a dermatopathologist cannot make a definitive call as to whether the biopsy is benign or malignant. Outcomes for patients are poor if melanoma is not caught in early stages with five year survival rates dropping from 98% for localized to less than 20% for distant stage disease cancer based upon data from the American Cancer Society. We believe myPath Melanoma may provide an accurate tool to assist physicians in correctly diagnosing indeterminate skin lesions. Based upon three clinical validation studies which were published in the Journal of Cutaneous Pathology in 2015, Cancer in 2016 and Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention in 2017, myPath Melanoma has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy of 90 to 95 percent. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe the global market for myPath Melanoma is approximately $1 billion annually. 
  
• | myChoice® HRD: Companion diagnostic to measure three modes of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) including loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions in cancer cells. Our myChoice HRD test is the most comprehensive homologous recombination deficiency test to detect when a tumor has lost the ability to repair double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging drugs such as platinum drugs or PARP inhibitors. The myChoice HRD score is a composite of three proprietary technologies: loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance and large-scale state transitions. Positive myChoice HRD scores, reflective of DNA repair deficiencies, are prevalent in all breast cancer subtypes, ovarian and most other major cancers. In previously published data, Myriad showed that the myChoice HRD test predicted drug response to platinum therapy in certain patients with triple-negative breast and ovarian cancers. Additionally, Myriad has submitted myChoice HRD for premarket approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use as a companion diagnostic in late stage ovarian cancer. It is estimated that 1.4 million people in the United States and Europe who are diagnosed with cancers annually may be candidates for treatment with DNA-damaging agents.

Pharmaceutical and Clinical Services 
 Our pharmaceutical and clinical services consist of the following:
  
• | Through Myriad RBM, we provide biomarker discovery and pharmaceutical and clinical services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical research industries utilizing our multiplexed immunoassay technology. Our technology enables us to efficiently screen large sets of well-characterized clinical samples from both diseased and non-diseased populations against our extensive menu of biomarkers. During the year ended June 30, 2019, Myriad RBM accounted for 4.0% of total revenue. In addition to the fees received from analyzing these samples, we also use this information to create and validate potential molecular diagnostic tests. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Privatklinik Dr. Robert Schindlbeck GmbH & Co. KG (the “Clinic”) is an internal medicine emergency hospital that is considered a specialized hospital for internal medicine and hemodialysis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Molecular Diagnostic Industry and Competition
 The markets in which we compete are rapidly evolving, and we face competition from multiple public companies, private companies, and academic/university laboratories for a number of our laboratory testing services. 
 In the hereditary cancer testing market we have faced increased competition since a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 2013 invalidated some of the key patent claims covering our hereditary cancer testing products. These patents were originally set to begin expiring in 2015.  Since this Supreme Court decision, numerous large reference laboratories, small private laboratories, and academic/university laboratories have launched competing hereditary cancer tests.  Despite the impact from competition, we continue to believe we are the world leader in hereditary cancer testing.
 The market for hereditary cancer testing has evolved dramatically over time. Broad reimbursement coverage for hereditary cancer tests began emerging in the early 2000s and coupled with increased public awareness around genetics and our marketing and promotional efforts, there has been significant growth in testing volumes. One of the largest drivers of growth has been increased testing in asymptomatic patients in the preventive care setting which now comprise over half of all tests performed in the United States. We are working to continue to expand awareness around hereditary cancer testing and expand the number of patients that qualify for hereditary cancer testing under medical guidelines and health insurance coverage policies.
 Another factor influencing the marketplace has been the advent of next generation sequencing. This has allowed the transition from single syndrome tests to targeted pan-cancer panels in a cost effective manner without sacrificing test accuracy. We launched our first pan-cancer panel, myRisk Hereditary Cancer, in September, 2013, and we believe panel based tests will become standard of care in the marketplace based upon their greater sensitivity at finding cancer causing mutations. We have presented multiple studies showing that myRisk Hereditary Cancer can detect greater than 60 percent more deleterious mutations when compared to our legacy hereditary cancer tests.  
 We compete in the hereditary cancer testing market based upon several factors including:
  
1) | the analytical accuracy of our tests
---+-------------------------------------


2) | our ability to classify genetic variants in hereditary cancer genes
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | the quality of our sales and marketing for our products
---+--------------------------------------------------------


4) | the quality of our customer service and support
---+------------------------------------------------

 6

 
5) | turnaround time
---+----------------


6) | additional information about cancer risks provided by riskScore; and
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------


7) | value associated with our test quality
---+---------------------------------------

 We believe that we have substantial advantages in terms of our test accuracy and ability to classify variants. Based on our testing experience of over 2.0 million patients, and our substantial investments in our variant classification program, we have compiled a proprietary database of over 60,000 unique genetic variants in the genes tested by myRisk Hereditary Cancer. We believe this database allows us to provide more accurate results to patients and return a variant of unknown significance (VUS) result to patients less frequently. We have demonstrated that this classification advantage leads to lower long-term healthcare costs and lower utilization of unnecessary healthcare services.
 Given our scale relative to other laboratories in the hereditary cancer testing market, we believe we also have substantial competitive advantages in terms of cost efficiencies and laboratory automation, which leads to faster turnaround times and improved accuracy for our tests.
 In the oncology companion diagnostic market, we currently sell our FDA approved BRACAnalysis CDx test as a companion diagnostic for the prediction of response to a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. Currently we are the only laboratory with an FDA approved germline test for this indication and have received approvals in ovarian and metastatic breast cancer diagnostics from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We also have proprietary tests currently in development including our myChoice HRD assay which we believe could identify a larger population of patients that could respond to PARP inhibitors but are not yet broadly commercially available. We submitted our first application for U.S. Food and Drug Administration premarket approval for myChoice HRD as a companion diagnostic in late stage ovarian cancer in early 2019. We compete in this market based upon the quality and turnaround time of our test, our ability to garner regulatory approvals for new indications, and based upon our proprietary testing methodologies.
 In the urology market, we compete against a small number of public and private companies for our prostate cancer prognostic test, Prolaris. We compete in this market primarily based upon the quality of the clinical data supporting the test, our first mover advantage in the marketplace and the strength of our sales support and customer service. 
 In the autoimmune market, our Vectra test competes primarily against traditional methodologies for assessing rheumatoid arthritis disease activity such as a physician’s clinical assessment of the patient and single marker laboratory tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP). We believe we have the most predictive product on the market to assess rheumatoid arthritis disease activity.
 In the neuroscience market, our GeneSight Psychotropic test meets a significant unmet clinical need and is the leading product for psychotropic drug selection.  It is for use by health-care professionals seeking patient-specific information on gene-drug interactions when contemplating an alteration in neuropsychiatric medication for patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are suffering with refractory moderate to very severe depression after at least one prior neuropsychiatric medication failure. The test is clinically proven to enhance medication selection, helping healthcare providers get their patients on the right medication faster.
 In the prenatal market, we compete against multiple companies including large national reference laboratories, other specialty laboratories, kit based products, and academic/university laboratories with our Foresight and Prequel tests. We compete based upon our test breadth/accuracy, commercial scale in the prenatal market, and the quality of our customer service/informatics tools.
 In the pharmaceutical and clinical services segment, our Myriad RBM division competes against other contract research organizations and academic laboratories for business from pharmaceutical and research customers. 
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our tests through our own direct sales force and marketing efforts in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada. Our United States sales force is comprised of approximately 800 individuals across six separate sales channels. In connection with any additional tests that we may launch, we may expand our existing oncology, women’s health, urology, dermatology, neuroscience and autoimmune care sales forces, or build new sales forces to address other physician specialty groups. In addition to our direct sales force, we have entered into distributor agreements with organizations in selected European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, Asian and African countries.

Research and Development
 We plan to continue to use our proprietary DNA sequencing, RNA expression and protein analysis technologies, including our supporting bioinformatics and robotic technologies, in an effort to efficiently discover important genes and their proteins and to understand their role in human disease.  Based on these biomarkers we plan to develop highly accurate, informative tests that may help physicians better manage their patients’ healthcare. We believe that our technologies provide us with a significant competitive advantage and the potential for numerous product opportunities. For the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had research and development expense of $85.9 million, $70.8 million, and $74.4 million, respectively.  
Acquisitions
 We intend to continue to take advantage of in-licensing or acquisition opportunities to augment our internal research and development programs.  We recognize that we cannot meet all of our research discovery goals internally and can benefit from the research performed by other organizations. We hope to leverage our financial strength, product development expertise, and sales and marketing presence to acquire new product opportunities in our molecular diagnostic areas of focus.
 In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of privately-held Crescendo Bioscience, Inc. (“Crescendo”) for $270 million in cash, which was reduced by the repayment of a loan made to Crescendo and other customary adjustments in accordance with the acquisition agreement.  We believe that the acquisition of Crescendo facilitates our entry into the high growth autoimmune and inflammatory disease market, diversifies our product revenues and enhances our strength in protein-based diagnostics.  The business of Crescendo, including its Vectra® blood test for rheumatoid arthritis disease management, is operated as a wholly owned subsidiary.
 In February 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Clinic for total consideration of $20.1 million.  
 In May 2016, we completed the acquisition of Sividon Diagnostics GmbH (“Sividon”), a leading breast cancer prognostic company, for $39.0 million upfront with the potential for €15.0 million ($17.1 million converted at the June 30, 2019 period end exchange rate) in additional performance-based milestones.  We believe the acquisition brings us the best-in-class breast cancer prognostic test and strengthens our market leading oncology portfolio of high value personalized medicine products.
 In August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Assurex Health, Inc. (“Assurex”) for total consideration of $351.6 million, net of cash acquired of $5.5 million. We believe the acquisition establishes the foundation for our neuroscience business and leverages our existing preventative care business unit with the addition of a product, GeneSight Psychotropic, which has significant growth potential.
 On July 31, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Counsyl, Inc. (“Counsyl”) for total consideration of $405.9 million, consisting of $278.5 million in cash and 2,994,251 shares of common stock issued that were valued at $127.4 million.  The shares were issued and valued as of July 31, 2018 at a per share market closing price of $42.53. We believe the acquisition allows for further entry into the high-growth reproductive testing market, with the ability to become a leader in women’s health genetic testing.
Seasonality
 We experience seasonality in our testing business. The volume of testing is negatively impacted by the summer holiday season which is generally reflected in our fiscal first quarter. Our fiscal second quarter ending December 31 is generally strong as we see an increase in volume from patients who have met their annual insurance deductible. Conversely, fiscal third quarter ending March 31 is typically negatively impacted by the annual reset of patient deductibles.

 We intend to seek patent protection in the United States and major foreign jurisdictions for synthetic nucleic acids, antibodies, biomarker signatures, assays, probes, primers, technologies, methods, processes and other inventions which we believe are patentable and where we believe our interests would be best served by seeking patent protection.  However, any patents issued to us or our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our products or technology or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated or narrowed or found unenforceable.  Any patent applications which we have filed, or will file, or to which we have licensed or will license rights may not issue, and patents that do issue may not contain commercially valuable claims.  In addition, others may obtain patents having claims which cover aspects of our tests or processes which are necessary for or useful to the development, use or performance of our diagnostic products.  Should any other group obtain patent protection with respect to our discoveries, our commercialization of our molecular diagnostic tests could be limited or prohibited.
 9

Others may offer clinical diagnostic genomic laboratory testing services which may infringe patents we control.  We may seek to negotiate a license to use our patent rights or decide to seek enforcement of our patent rights through litigation.  Patent litigation is expensive and the outcome is often uncertain and we may not be able to enforce our patent rights against others.  
 Our tests and processes may also conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others.  In addition, third parties could bring legal actions against us seeking to invalidate our owned or licensed patents, claiming damages, or seeking to enjoin clinical testing, developing and marketing of our tests or processes.  If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could lose patent coverage for our tests, be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license in order to continue to develop or market the relevant test or process.  We may not prevail in any such action, and any license required under any such patent may not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all.  Our failure to maintain patent protection for our test and processes or to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our tests and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, and in the future may determine in some cases that our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents or licenses.  These include some of our genomic, proteomic, RNA expression, mutation analysis, robotic and bioinformatic technologies which may be used in discovering and characterizing new genes and proteins and ultimately used in the development or analysis of molecular diagnostic tests.  We also maintain a database of gene mutations and their status as either harmful or benign for all of our hereditary cancer tests.  To further protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require that our employees and consultants enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements.  However, those confidentiality and invention assignment agreements may not provide us with adequate protection.  We may not be able to protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology and others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies.  If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary rights to our processes or tests, competitors may be able to market competing processes and tests.
 License Agreements
 We are a party to license agreements which give us the rights to use certain technologies in the research, development, testing processes, and commercialization of our molecular diagnostic tests and pharmaceutical and clinical services.  We may not be able to continue to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Additionally, patents underlying our license agreements may not afford meaningful protection for our technology or tests or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated or narrowed, or found unenforceable.  Our failure to maintain rights to this technology could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
 In 2006, Assurex Health, Inc. (now our wholly-owned subsidiary) entered into an agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (“Mayo”), which granted to Assurex an exclusive world-wide license to utilize certain rights of Mayo in intellectual property relating to what is now GeneSight testing.  Under this license agreement we pay Mayo a royalty based on net sales of our GeneSight test.  This license expires upon expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the Mayo agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2024.  Mayo has the right to terminate the agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the agreement.
 In 2006, Assurex Health, Inc. entered into a license agreement with the Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati (“CHMC”) for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain rights of CHMC in intellectual property that could at some point relate to GeneSight testing.  This license agreement has no expiration, but CHMC has the right to terminate the agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement.
 In 2010, Crescendo Bioscience, Inc. (now our wholly-owned subsidiary) entered into a license agreement with the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation (the “OMRF”), for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain intellectual property rights of OMRF including patent applications relating to what is now Vectra testing.  Under this license agreement we pay OMRF a royalty based on net sales of our Vectra test.  This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2031.  OMRF has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement.

In 2012, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (the “UTMDACC”), for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain rights of UTMDACC in intellectual property relating to what is now myChoice® HRD testing.  Under this license agreement we will pay UTMDACC a royalty based on net sales of our myChoice® HRD test, if any.  This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2032.  UTMDACC has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement.
 In 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Children’s Medical Center in Boston (“CMCC”) for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain rights of CMCC in intellectual property relating to what is now myChoice® HRD testing.  Under this license agreement we expect to pay CMCC a royalty based on net sales of our myChoice® HRD test, if any.  This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2032.  CMCC has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement.
 In 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Institut Curie and INSERM (“INSERM”) for the exclusive world-wide right to utilize certain rights of INSERM in intellectual property relating to what is now myChoice® HRD testing.  Under this license agreement we expect to pay INSERM a royalty based on net sales of our myChoice® HRD test, if any.  This license agreement ends on expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the license agreement, which presently is not anticipated to expire until 2032.  INSERM has the right to terminate the license agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the license agreement.
 In 2015, Counsyl, Inc. (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, named Myriad Women’s Health, Inc.) entered into an agreement with Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”), which granted to Counsyl a non-exclusive license to utilize certain rights held by or licensed to Illumina to intellectual property relating to non-invasive prenatal screening and the Prequel test.  Under this license agreement we pay Illumina a royalty based on the volume of Prequel testing administered by us.  This license runs for the term of the Illumina agreement and, in any event, expires upon expiration of the last to expire patent covered by the Illumina agreement.  Illumina has the right to terminate the agreement for the uncured breach of any material term of the agreement.
 Governmental Regulation 
 The services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities.  Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from state and federal health care programs.  The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
 Each of our clinical laboratories must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business.  Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”).  CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely.  CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services.  Our laboratories in Salt Lake City, Utah, Austin, Texas, Mason, Ohio, and South San Francisco, California are CLIA certified to perform high complexity tests.
In addition, CLIA requires each of our certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if performing testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required.  Each of our laboratories periodically tests specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submits the results back to that organization for evaluation.  If one of our laboratories fails to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, then it loses its right to perform testing.  Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of the laboratory’s CLIA certification.
 As a condition of CLIA certification, each of our laboratories is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections.  The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or, a CMS-approved accreditation organization.  Because our laboratories are accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”), which is a CMS-approved accreditation organization, they are typically subject to CAP inspections.  
 11

Our laboratories are licensed by the appropriate state agencies in the states in which they operate, if such licensure is required.  In addition, our laboratories hold state licenses or permits, as applicable, from various states including, but not limited to, California, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Maryland, to the extent that they accept specimens from one or more of these states, each of which requires out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure.  
 If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories or with CLIA, penalties may include suspension, limitation or revocation of the license or CLIA certificate, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment.  Loss of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate or state license may also result in the inability to receive payments from state and federal health care programs as well as private third party payors.  We believe that we are in material compliance with CLIA and all applicable licensing laws and regulations.  
 Food and Drug Administration
 Although the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”) that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not otherwise regulating most LDTs and has not required laboratories that furnish LDTs to comply with the agency’s requirements for medical devices (e.g., establishment registration, device listing, quality systems regulations, premarket clearance or premarket approval, and post-market controls).  More recently, the FDA has indicated that it will apply a risk-based approach to determine the regulatory pathway for all in-vitro diagnostics (“IVDs”), including IVD companion and complementary diagnostic devices, as it does with all medical devices. Accordingly, the regulatory pathway for a IVD will depend on the level of risk to patients, based on the intended use of the IVD and the controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the IVD’s safety and effectiveness. The two primary types of marketing pathways for medical devices are clearance of a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 510(k), and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA.  IVD companion diagnostic devices developed for use with drugs will typically utilize the PMA pathway following a clinical trial performed under an investigational device exemption, or IDE, which is required to be completed before the PMA may be submitted.
 We are developing companion diagnostic tests for use with drug products in development by pharmaceutical companies, such as our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies on PARP inhibitors for the treatment of ovarian, breast and other cancers.  Companion diagnostic tests are currently subject to regulation by the FDA as medical devices.  The FDA issued Guidance on In-Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices in July 2014, which is intended to assist companies developing in vitro companion diagnostic devices and companies developing therapeutic products that depend on the use of a specific in-vitro companion diagnostic for the safe and effective use of the product.  The FDA defined an in-vitro companion diagnostic device (“IVD Companion Dx”) as a device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product.  The FDA expects that the therapeutic sponsor will address the need for an approved or cleared IVD Companion Dx in its therapeutic product development plan and that, in most cases, the therapeutic product and its corresponding companion diagnostic will be developed contemporaneously.  On July 15, 2016, the FDA released a draft guidance entitled, “Principles for Co-development of an In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Device with a Therapeutic Product.  This draft guidance document is intended to be a practical guide to assist therapeutic product sponsors and IVD sponsors in developing a therapeutic product and an accompanying IVD companion diagnostic.
 The FDA has also introduced the concept of a complementary diagnostic that it defines as a test that is not required but which provides significant information about the use of a drug.  A complementary test can help guide treatment strategy and identify which patients are likely to derive the greatest benefit from therapy, and if approved by the FDA information regarding the IVD will be included in the therapeutic product labelling.  Although the FDA has not yet issued any written guidance regarding complementary diagnostics, it has already approved a couple of complementary diagnostics, including a supplementary premarket approval for BRACAnalysis CDx, which was approved in March 2017, as a complementary diagnostic test in ovarian cancer patients associated with enhanced progression-free survival (PFS) when used with Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor Zejula™ (niraparib) maintenance therapy.
 In December 2014, we obtained premarket approval for BRACAnalysis CDx, which is used as a companion diagnostic test to identify ovarian cancer patients who may benefit from AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza™ (olaparib). The premarket approval process is a complex, costly and time consuming procedure.  Approvals must be supported by valid scientific evidence, submitted as part of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), which typically requires extensive data, including quality technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the companion diagnostic. We are currently collaborating with several pharmaceutical companies, including AstraZeneca, Merck, Pfizer, GSK, AbbVie, and others for additional indications and geographical commercialization opportunities for BRACAnalysis CDx, to evaluate the use of several of our tests as companion diagnostics with other drugs.

After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply.  These include: 
  
• | compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, or unapproved uses, or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or approval of PMAs of new devices; withdrawal of clearance or approval; and civil or criminal prosecution.  
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Our laboratories are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
 HIPAA and other privacy laws
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”).  Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions.  The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose.  The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.  
 On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  HITECH expanded and strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new penalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities.  Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”).  
 Under HITECH's breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”).  Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach.  Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and, in some cases depending on the size of the breach; they must be reported through local and national media.  Breach reports can lead to investigation, enforcement and civil litigation, including class action lawsuits.
 We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations and maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law.  We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH.  We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH.  To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis.  However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.  
 13

In May 2016, a complaint was filed with the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OCR”) by four patients alleging deficiencies in our policies regarding information that must be disclosed to patients as part of a “designated record set” under HIPAA.  We proactively reached out to OCR on these issues to explain our compliance with all applicable regulations and OCR guidance.  On April 26, 2019, OCR sent us a closure letter ending its inquiries, which did not require any further action by the Company.
 In addition to the federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories.  Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results.  State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease.  We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal.  However, these laws constantly change and we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business.  Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, significant reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials.  For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S.  This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries.  For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association.  We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
 Transparency Laws and Regulations
 A federal law known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”) requires medical device manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.  Manufacturers must report data for the previous calendar year by the 90th day of the then-current calendar year.  CMS then publishes the data on a publicly available website no later than June 30th.  There are also state “sunshine” laws that require manufacturers to provide reports to state governments on pricing and marketing information.  Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and such laws may also prohibit or limit certain other sales and marketing practices.  These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us.  If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or to otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Reimbursement and Billing
 Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is highly complex.  Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including managed care organizations (“MCO”), and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements.  Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process.  Other factors that complicate billing include:

• | variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patient financial assistance programs;
--+---------------------------------------


• | missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 14

Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:
  
• | a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a state or federal healthcare program; or
--+------------------------------------------


• | the patient.
--+-------------

 Presently, approximately 85% of our revenue comes from private third party payors.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 A variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid.  These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse.  Any overpayments must be repaid within 60 days of identification unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal.  In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.
 Anti-Kickback Laws
 The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program.  “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment.  The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.
 Recognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors intended to protect such arrangements.  Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute.  The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution.  Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals.  The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe.  These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs.  Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.
 Physician Self-Referral Bans
 The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity.  Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including but not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements.  Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs.  In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor. 
 15

State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims
 The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government.  Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.  Specific intent to defraud is not required.  The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action.  Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs.  In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services.  The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.
 International regulations
 We market some of our tests outside of the United States and are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests.  These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing.  On September 26, 2012, the European Commission released the first drafts of the new European Union (“EU”) regulations for medical devices and IVDs that if finalized will impose additional regulatory requirements on IVDs used in the EU.  In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required.  We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.
 Human Resources 
 As of June 30, 2019, we have over 2,600 full-time equivalent employees. Most of our employees are engaged directly in research, development, production, sales and marketing activities. We believe that the success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
