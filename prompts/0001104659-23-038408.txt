Item 1. Business.
Overview
Our mission is to provide high-quality entertainment experiences to audiences around the world. We are a leading, global independent developer and publisher of interactive digital entertainment for consumers around the world. We have built a premier portfolio of premium games designed for use on a variety of platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. ARK: Survival Evolved has been a top-25 selling game on the Steam platform by gross revenue in each year we released ARK downloadable content (“DLC”). Our expertise in technology, in-game ecosystems and monetization of online multiplayer games has enabled us to assemble a broad portfolio of intellectual property across multiple media formats and technology platforms. Our flagship franchise from which we generate the substantial majority of our revenues, ARK: Survival Evolved, is a leader within the sandbox survival genre with over 84.7 million console and PC installs through December 31, 2022. See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Measures.” In the year ended December 31, 2022, ARK: Survival Evolved averaged a total of 305,376 daily active users (“DAUs”) on the Steam and Epic platforms, and we experienced a peak of approximately 1,112,797 DAUs in June 2022. We define “daily active users” as the number of unique users who play any given game on any given day. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated 90.8% and 90.7%, respectively, of our revenues from ARK: Survival Evolved.
Our roots trace back to the beginnings of the massively multiplayer online role-playing games (“MMORPG”), with early titles including Age of Wushu. Our long history provides us with substantial experience that we leverage to identify and invest in promising game development studios and to manage the growth of our games into AAA titles. We collaborate with talented development teams, providing our expertise, capital, technological resources, customer service, marketing strategy and other services to achieve a successful outcome.
We optimize our development pipeline and target specific market segments by publishing games under several specialized brands through our two publishing labels, Snail Games USA and Wandering Wizard. Our distribution strategy utilizes Steam’s early access feature to achieve faster go-to-market times. We utilize proprietary technology, including a versatile game engine and advanced server technology, to heighten artistic detail and increase player engagement.
We attribute our continued success to several differentiating elements.
Perseverance: We are called Snail because we admire a snail’s perseverance in achieving its goals. We maintain a disciplined approach to our game development, financial management and strategic acquisitions as we seek to deliver long-term value.
Innovation: We believe innovation is at the core of a highly engaging entertainment experience. Our titles span from indie to our AAA franchise ARK: Survival Evolved. We created the Wandering Wizard label to allow us to invest and grow indie titles built by bright, passionate teams.
Technology: We utilize advanced and proprietary technologies to drive demand and optimize costs. Our proprietary micro-influencer platform, NOIZ, operated by our subsidiary Eminence Corp, enables us to substantially broaden our influencer base at an advantaged cost, and our game and server technology provide a highly customizable development infrastructure.
Collaboration: We partner with talented independent studios for game development. Development teams, some of which are our wholly owned subsidiaries, are provided capital and other critical resources and are afforded a high degree of autonomy. We believe this model best preserves the culture and creativity of the development team and encourages the development of successful games.
Developers: We believe in the importance of maintaining a broad developer network to ensure the simultaneous development of high-quality games. We have seven internal development studios and we partner with two related-party development studios from AAA to indie located in the United States and internationally.

Experience: Our management team has deep knowledge of the gaming landscape based on more than two decades of experience in the gaming industry. Our Founder, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, Mr. Hai Shi, was a pioneer in sandbox and MMORPG games, and our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tsai, has a deep understanding of game development and publishing with more than 25 years of experience. Our industry experience is foundational to our success in development and publishing and helps us to quickly identify attractive acquisition and partnership opportunities.
Our dedication to providing audiences with high-quality entertainment experiences utilizing the latest gaming technology has produced strong user engagement, continued revenue growth, and increased cash flows. Through December 31, 2022, our ARK franchise game has been played for 3.1 billion hours with an average playing time per user of more than 160.2 hours and with the top 21.0% of all players spending over 100 hours in the game, according to data related to the Steam platform. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net revenue was $74.4 million and $106.7 million, respectively. We have maintained a diversified revenue base across platforms. During fiscal year 2022, approximately 43.5% of our revenue came from consoles, 42.4% from PC and 12.8% from mobile platforms. We had net income of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to net income of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Recent Developments
We have robust plans to bolster our ARK franchise in 2023 with DLCs for existing platforms, new titles and an expansion of our offerings on the Nintendo Switch platform. In February 2023, we announced the release of Ragnarok on the Nintendo Switch platform. Additional Nintendo Switch offerings expected to come in 2023 include release of the Extinction; Valguero, Genesis I, and Crystal Isles DLCs in the second quarter; Lost Island and Genesis II DLCs in the third quarter; followed by The Center DLC and a new map, Fjordur, in the fourth quarter of 2023. We have a significant upgrade of ARK: Survival Evolved planned for the PlayStation, Xbox, Steam and Epic platforms and the release of a new service program on PlayStation and Xbox in the first half of 2023. In the second quarter of 2023 our mobile players can expect to enjoy a complete relaunch of ARK. Lastly, we plan to relaunch our Survival of the Fittest multiplayer online survival arena later this year.
Market Opportunity
We serve a large addressable market in a dynamic industry with strong growth tailwinds. Video games are rapidly growing as an entertainment platform on a global scale given the proliferation of mobile devices and numerous vectors of gaming experience. We are well-positioned to capitalize on economic trends in our markets as we own and/or maintain exclusive license rights to valuable IP that can be monetized through various channels across gaming and digital entertainment. We believe that our current market leadership in video games and growing presence in influencer platform through NOIZ is just our beginning.
We have developed and invested in various successful sandbox survival titles since 2015. Our video game production quality, our history of franchise success, and our technological leadership have contributed to a deeply engaged, global player community, many members of which continue to purchase DLCs for our existing games and related games published under our brand or co-brands. We also offer the advantage of providing equal accessibility to gamers of all experience levels and demographics for our sandbox survival games, allowing us to maximize audience reach. Furthermore, depending on players’ experience and intensity, our platform gives players the flexibility to play on our servers, user-created servers, or private servers, which allows us to target a wider range of gamers and lower operating expenses.
Our Value Proposition
Value proposition for gamers: We aim to provide high-quality entertainment experience to end users. We strive to create the best game play experience for gamers by offering frequent new content and endless game play possibility as key value propositions to our players.
New Content: We continuously incorporate feedback from players to improve existing games and build expansion packs, which are released periodically. DLCs offer gamers a familiar game play in a new virtual world with a different fantasy twist from dinosaurs to Sci-Fi.
Endless Possibility: Our games provide hours of entertainment with features that permit dynamic environmental changes of the virtual world, user-directed conquests, and cooperative or competitive gameplay with other users. Our sandbox games provide players with freedom, without the rules found in other genres such as racing games.

Value proposition for developers: Our business model is dependent on partnerships with developers, and we offer key value propositions of collaborative partnership, culture of innovation and technology to our developers.
Collaborative Partnership: We provide capital, technological resources, customer service, marketing strategy and other services to our video game development partners. We strategize with developers to customize marketing campaigns tailored to target markets. Our founder also provides developers with creative and other advice based on his deep expertise in the industry.
Culture of Innovation: We believe high-quality experiences result from a combination of forward thinking and fearless creativity. We encourage our development teams to experiment with emerging technologies and unique fantasy twists.
Technology: Our developers have access to our advanced development infrastructure as well as our proprietary technology including our micro-influencer technology, NOIZ, which helps brands engage with previously untapped small- to mid-sized influencers.
Our Platform
Our strategic flywheel is anchored by our dedication to delivering high-quality, compelling entertainment experiences and is driven by our capabilities in publishing, developing and creating proprietary technology. Growth in the number of published titles allows us to invest in new development teams and proprietary technology, which expand the number of titles we publish in a self-reinforcing loop. As the quality of our games increases, we are well-positioned to attract more users and more influencers. With increased influencers through our propriety micro-influencer platform, NOIZ, we are able to reach a broader audience and increase user engagement within our games. This drives additional revenue, which we use to increase our developer network and to build proprietary technology. Our technology, along with our collaborative, innovative culture attracts talented developers, which in turn result in an increased number of high-quality games.

Publishing: We derive the majority of our revenue from titles we offer through licensing and publishing agreements. Our ARK franchise is led by our strategic partnership with Studio Wildcard. Our typical publishing cycle includes annual DLC releases for our major franchises, after which we repeat the same publishing cycle to attract new players and continue to entertain our existing players. We seek to bring new fantasy twists and genres to our players with innovative, creative content cultivated from strong partnerships with independent developers and published through our Wandering Wizard label.
Development: We also develop titles using a partnership approach in which we acquire ownership stakes in independent development teams. We preserve a development team’s culture by allowing a high degree of autonomy in its operations, which we believe allows development teams to retain their creative license, while also extracting synergies by utilizing our shared resources including customer service and backend functions. Furthermore, we foster a culture of communication where employees at all levels at our partner studios are able to receive direct feedback from our CEO. We partnered with Donkey Crew to produce Last Oasis, a nomadic survival massively multiplayer online game (“MMO”) with melee combat conquests, and with BTBX.io to produce Life is Feudal II, a sandbox survival game set in medieval times.

Technology: We are early adopters of the latest technology in our games and develop proprietary technology when necessary to address market opportunities. We maintain a flexible infrastructure to efficiently develop virtual worlds with advanced rendering and atmospheric effects across a wide array of video game types. We developed a proprietary micro-influencer marketing platform, NOIZ, to help game streamers and game companies reach a wider audience and diversify marketing spend. We work with our developers to create custom campaigns to optimize reach.
Our Key Strengths
Top-ranked category defining franchise with a track record of growth: Our dedication to our customers and innovative game development has resulted in our position as a top-ranked, category-defining franchise with a track record of growth. Our flagship franchise, ARK: Survival Evolved, is a leader within the sandbox survival genre with over 84.7 million console and PC installs through December 31, 2022. ARK: Survival Evolved has been a top-25 selling game on the Steam platform by gross revenue in each year we released an ARK DLC. As of December 31, 2022, ARK: Survival Evolved reached a peak audience of over 1,112,797 DAUs on PC platforms, and has been played 3.1 billion hours since its release.
Proven expertise in creating successful gaming franchises: We have proven expertise in creating successful gaming franchises. We are a multi-platform publisher with over 13 years of experience in creating culturally influential game titles, while demonstrating financial growth. As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 26 game titles. By recognizing the lucrative potential of the sandbox survival category at its nascent stages, we became a first mover in the category, and we now license and publish leading IP or license to the IP, including the global franchise ARK: Survival Evolved, Atlas, Last Oasis, Dark and Light and Outlaws of the Old West. Our approach to the industry is to create a one-size-fits-all game to draw people into the overall sandbox survival genre. In order to retain players, we invest in game quality to generate additional interest, in addition to spending on advertising. Our collaborative relationships with video game development studios, industry leaders, technology providers and distribution platforms allow us to invest in promising video game projects and manage their growth into AAA video games and entertainment franchises. Our approach creates a continuous cycle of monetization opportunities across our gaming portfolio.
IP portfolio spanning across multiple media formats and technology platforms to captivate end user: We license and own an IP portfolio spanning across multiple media formats and technology platforms to captivate end users. Our primary use of IP is to generate successful video games within and beyond the sandbox survival genre. Currently, our games are available on Xbox Live and Game Pass, PlayStation Network, Steam, Epic Games Store, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, My Nintendo Store and the Amazon Appstore, as well as through traditional retail channels. However, our vision for our valuable IP rights extend far beyond just gaming: our vision extends into media formats such as animation, TV, movies, eSports, and reality TV and interactive media, which we believe has tremendous potential. We have high aspirations across digital media and are poised to enter the animation and television industry with ARK, the Animated Series in 2023.
Collaborative development process between developers and management: We continue to evolve with the industry with our deep pipeline of leading video game franchises such as ARK: Survival Evolved, Atlas, Last Oasis, Dark and Light and Outlaws of the Old West. Our success in game development and in keeping up with industry trends is partially attributed to our collaborative relationships with video game development studios, industry leaders, technology providers and distribution platforms. Our cooperative development process provides for a proprietary scalable model to publish multiple AAA video games based on current trends. We are proud of our collaborative relationship with our developers, as we believe it is truly unique in our industry and one of our main differentiators. We offer developers an ecosystem that aligns incentives and creates an environment for creativity to thrive. In addition to wonderful ideas for games, we value partners who share our vision and culture. After a partnership is formed, we offer developers a direct line of communication to Mr. Shi, our Founder, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, who is viewed as a pioneer in the video game industry and business world. We offer developers freedom by giving them access to the wide breadth of the Snail platform and resources so they can do what they do best: create.
Innovative use and creation of next-gen technologies and platforms: We use innovative technology to serve our customers, allowing us to provide high-quality user experiences and services. Our proprietary video game technology includes a versatile game engine, development pipeline tools, advanced rendering technology and advanced server and network operations, although we also use currently accepted standard industry technologies. Additionally, our customizable development infrastructure provides a framework for efficiently developing all types of video game projects using advanced rendering technologies for realistic lighting, weather and atmospheric effects, for creating new types of virtual assets and for other effects that heighten artistic detail and increase player engagement. Since inception, we have been developing our proprietary engine, Flexi. Unlike mainstream commercial engines, we are developing Flexi to allow us to save on royalty costs and retain ownership of our modifications to engines. We are currently creating an AAA game fully utilizing the Flexi engine to display its advanced capabilities. Most commercial engines are designed for single session 

5



games and a small number of concurrent players in a specific geolocation. Our goal with Flexi, however, is to have the capability to handle a greater number of players in a particular area, which can be utilized for larger games with robust user interactions. Our micro-influencer business, NOIZ, strives to build an influencer marketing platform for brands to directly engage with small to-midsized influencers, through which influencers can reach millions of video game consumers and generate additional revenue at a cost advantage.
Visionary management team well versed in industry and business: We attribute much of our success to our visionary senior management and business development teams, which have a deep understanding of games and global video markets and aim to build innovative products for gamers. Our Founder, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman, Mr. Shi, is also the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Suzhou Snail Digital Technology Co., Ltd. (“Suzhou Snail”), a related party, and is a pioneer in the video game industry and the sandbox survival genre. Mr. Shi is responsible for our overall vision, which has included adapting our business model for the global markets, focusing on premium games and investing in video game development and publishing in North America and Europe. Our Chief Executive Officer, Jim Tsai, has 25 years of experience developing and publishing video games in both Asia and the United States. Our founder and other members of our management and business development teams are seasoned gamers, who lead and provide insight into gaming development from a first-hand user’s perspective. We operate in an ecosystem in which our leaders employ a hands-on approach, as each developer is able to get direct contact with our founder and receive one-on-one feedback and mentorship.
Our Growth Strategy
Continue to grow our successful ARK: Survival Evolved franchise: As one of the most creative and innovative companies in our industry, our primary strategy is to capitalize on our franchise and focus on delivering unique games and content, offering services that extend and enhance the experience, and connecting more players across more platforms. We believe the breadth and depth of our multi-platform, services offerings, and our use of multiple business models and distribution channels provide us with strategic advantages. We have established ourselves as a market leader and will continue to enhance our market-leading gaming franchises including ARK: Survival Evolved, Atlas, Last Oasis, Dark and Light and Outlaws of the Old West. We focus on publishing high-quality content, regularly updating our games after launch to encourage social interactions, adding new content and features, and improving monetization. For example, we have released five paid DLCs since the original release of ARK: Survival Evolved to support further growth in our ARK franchise.
Continue to build a strong pipeline of new content via Snail Games USA and our independent label, Wandering Wizard: Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling new content is at the core of our business. We are always seeking ways to expand our portfolio of franchises, launching new intellectual property or rolling out innovative platforms for gamers to remain engaged and have a unique experience. We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible by offering our content on multiple platforms and delivering compelling experiences across multiple business models. Currently, we have five console and PC games under development that are expected to be released in the next five years. Our independent label, Wandering Wizard, allows us to publish independent games of different graphical quality and different genres at a lower acquisition cost while utilizing our proven development and distribution strategies. Titles published under Wandering Wizard include West Hunt and Expedition Agartha. In addition to spending on advertising, we invest in the research and development of new games as a form of marketing to increase our exposure. We believe that utilizing resources in this manner allows us to better leverage our areas of developmental expertise before launching a title. Each new game serves as an opportunity to market ourselves, expose audiences to the sandbox survival genre, engage with existing players, and monetize our platform’s full breadth of opportunities.
Continue to expand NOIZ, our micro-influencer marketing business, and use the platform to bolster our marketing initiatives and eCommerce revenue: We are focused on reaching more players whenever and wherever they want to play. We believe that we can add value to our network by utilizing content creators and micro-influencers to connect to a world of play by offering an interactive platform for players to engage in. We created our proprietary, full-service marketing platform, NOIZ, where we have direct relationships with influencers and save on third-party costs. NOIZ helps aspiring game streamers and game companies reach a wider audience, diversify marketing spend and income streams, and build their own brands easily and professionally at a large scale. Influencers can join the platform and play for free over a three day period. NOIZ provides speed and payment to influencers, in addition to speed in the execution of marketing campaigns since no large scale agencies are involved. NOIZ benefits all of our marketing and promotional initiatives and serves as a source of eCommerce revenue. NOIZ is designed so that clients can choose to work on campaigns on their own or directly with our creative campaign managers in an end-to-end managed campaign process, with 24/7 support, by paying a fee. The management team at NOIZ is comprised of eSports and gaming industry veterans and has worked with clients such as Square Enix, Sega, Stunlock Studios, Facebook, Sansar, TikTok, Bose, Softgiving, and Omaze. NOIZ directly contributes to our video game growth because each influencer’s stream of our games to their followers is a sales opportunity. Micro- and macro-influencers have taken 

6



advantage of NOIZ’s unique program, through which they receive a portion of the revenue from the video games they help sell. Through NOIZ, we can also collect data used to analyze new trends and self-market our products.
Continue investing in new technologies and platforms to efficiently capitalize on emerging trends: We provide a variety of digitally delivered products and games that are played online and on mobile platforms, such as tablets and smartphones; as such, there are various opportunities for us to grow and enhance profitability. We will continue investing in new distribution channels such as medias of streaming, animation, television and eSports as opportunities in platform distribution as well as DLCs arise to expand our reach and grow our business. We invest in the development of interactive entertainment products for new distribution channels, which incorporate a new technology or business model that enables us to compete more effectively against our peers. For our future games, we ultimately aim to build a metaverse in which users can create their own gameplay content and interact in a virtual world with other players over a secured network. We intend to build our metaverse using our Flexi engine, which will allow for better data management and hosting of significantly more players per server. We intend to hold competitions where players can submit created content and receive rewards, with the potential of incorporation into a new map as DLC with the assistance of our development team.
Scale our operations through international market expansion and strategic acquisitions: In line with our growth strategy, we plan to complete acquisitions to expand our gaming offerings, obtain talent, and expand into new markets. We continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities in areas such as studios, publishers, and agencies. We may also pursue joint ventures or establish subsidiaries with strategic partners as well as make investments in interactive gaming and entertainment business as part of our long-term business strategy. The global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow, and we seek to increase our presence internationally, particularly in South America, where video game demand is expected to increase as the region advances in technology. We have existing relationships and customers in South America which we hope will continue to grow. We retain licensing rights to our intellectual properties in certain regions and intend to build on our existing licensing relationships and also continue to expand on license distribution strategies to grow our international business. As a result, we are actively exploring international strategic opportunities that fit our needs and culture. We also intend to release a Spanish version of NOIZ, expand publishing in South America, increase public relations and game announcements in the region, and grow our number of Spanish translators. We also seek to expand our licensing opportunities to new platforms and other geographies. We are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives, where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our licensing opportunities. We intend to continue to build on our licensing relationships and also continue to expand on distribution strategies to grow our business. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce will enable us to explore more licensing opportunities across various geographic regions.
Our Games
ARK: Survival Evolved: Our flagship franchise, ARK: Survival Evolved, is an action-adventure survival sandbox game set in an open-world environment with a dynamic day-night cycle. Players must survive being stranded on an island filled with roaming dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players. The game, ranked #1 by market share within the sandbox survival genre, released to Early Access in June 2015 and to retail in August 2017. The game supports consoles (PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch), PCs and mobile (Android, iOS). We developed ARK in partnership with Studio Wildcard, and have released five expansion packs, or DLCs.

Last Oasis: Developed in connection with our wholly owned subsidiary, Donkey Crew, Last Oasis is a Nomadic Survival MMO with a focus on PvP, clan warfare and social interactions. Set in the unique world where the Earth has stopped rotating, the last human survivors need to outrun the scorching Sun using giant wind walkers to avoid the ever moving cloud of magic mist. The game was released by Early Access on March 2020, and currently supports consoles (Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S) and PCs.

Atlas: Developed in partnership with Grapeshot Games, Atlas is a pirate themed sandbox survival game. The game features a massive world, using the latest network technology, allowing for an infinite array of islands to explore and inhabit as the players see fit. The game was released by Early Access on December 2018 and supports consoles (Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S) and PCs.
Our Technology
We employ industry standard game engines for the majority of our games, which allows flexibility and accelerated game development. Our proprietary code modifies the game engines to fit the needs and features of our games as necessary, and for franchises like ARK, we are able to leverage that proprietary code in the development of new DLCs for existing games and development of entirely new games. We retain ownership of all code developed for our proprietary engine, Flexi, which is currently being used to develop certain games in our pipeline with the expectation of launching to external developers in the near future.
We offer an industry-leading micro-influencer platform, NOIZ, through which influencers can connect with brands in need. We continue to make technological enhancements to NOIZ, with a focus on streamlining the process to connect brands with influencers, and facilitating and simplifying the agreements that need to be executed between the two parties.
Our Competition
The interactive entertainment market is highly competitive and evolves rapidly as new games, content and features are introduced. We compete with other interactive entertainment companies such as Activision Blizzard, Inc., Electronic Arts Inc., Take-Two Interactive, Zynga, Ubisoft, Epic Games, Tencent, Netmarble, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo primarily for game development on consoles, PCs and mobile devices. Across the sandbox survival game genre, we primarily compete with Embracer Group, Saber Group, Enand Global 7, FunCom, Axolot Games, and Facepunch Studios. We also face competition from other independent developer studios. Important factors in the video game development and publishing industries include innovation, creative and technical talent, game quality, brand recognition, platform compatibility, pricing, accessibility to distribution channels and customer service.
Our micro-influencer platform NOIZ competes against other growth-stage companies in the space, such as Lurkit and Rainmaker Collective, although NOIZ is the only micro-influencer platform currently in the operating stage.
Our broader competitors include other providers of digital entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, streaming and music.
Regulatory Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile application, content, advertising and marketing activities (including sweepstakes, contests and giveaways) and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players and deliver products and services, which significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to include new uses or collection of data that are subject to privacy or security regulations and our operations continue to expand across the globe, our compliance requirements and costs will increase and we may be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny.
For more information regarding risks relating to data privacy and security, see Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal or Regulatory Compliance — Changing data privacy and security laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we or our consumers do business could increase the cost of our operations and subject us to possible sanctions, civil lawsuits (including class action or similar representative lawsuits) and other penalties; such laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our platform and service providers’ actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Intellectual Property
Similar to other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, other technology, and trade secrets that we use to run our games. Other intellectual property includes copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear, and interact with when they are playing our games. Most of the intellectual property we use is licensed to us by third-party game developers. We obtain such intellectual property rights through licenses and service agreements, and such licenses may limit our use of such intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods. We seek to advance and maintain our business through both a combination of licensed and owned intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned the following trademarks related to the business: 15 registered trademarks in the United States and two registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any pending trademark registration applications. As of December 31, 2022, we owned nine registered United States copyrights. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any issued U.S. design patents and one pending U.S. design patent application through one of our subsidiaries, which is scheduled to expire in 2033, assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees. Additionally, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as snailgamesusa.com and playark.com.
A majority of our revenue is derived from licensed intellectual property, such as our ARK franchise. We license the intellectual property underlying our ARK franchise from SDE, the parent company of Studio Wildcard. SDE is controlled by the spouse of Mr. Shi, our Founder, Chief Strategy Officer and Chairman. We entered into an original exclusive software license agreement with SDE in November 2015, for the rights to ARK: Survival Evolved, and subsequently amended and restated such agreement on September 20, 2022 (the “ARK1 License Agreement”). Pursuant to the ARK1 License Agreement, we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to publish and sell ARK: Survival Evolved, and we owe SDE monthly payments of $1.5 million, a 25% royalty on ARK: Survival Evolved revenue, as well as one-time payments of $5.0 million for each additional DLC developed pursuant to the ARK1 License Agreement. The ARK1 License Agreement imposes obligations on us to, among other things, maintain servers and websites, promote ARK: Survival Evolved, pay all necessary game engine fees and take commercially reasonable efforts to protect the game from piracy and hacking. The initial term of the ARK1 License Agreement continues until December 31, 2035, and will renew automatically for three-year terms unless terminated by either party with 365 days’ prior written notice. The ARK1 License Agreement also contains a right of first refusal for any offer to acquire all or any part of SDE’s business on terms consistent with such offer. Pursuant to the ARK1 License Agreement, payments made by us to SDE for any derivative ARK game (such as ARK 2) shall be credited against our payment obligations under the ARK1 License Agreement. In December 2022, we amended the ARK1 License Agreement. The license fee has been restructured so that we will pay 45% of total revenue of ARK 1 as a royalty instead of the $1.5 million monthly fee plus 25% of the total ARK 1 revenue once the sequel, ARK 2, is publicly released. In 2022 and 2021, we paid $18.0 million and $18.0 million, respectively, in license costs and $16.4 million and $20.4 million, respectively, in royalty payments pursuant to the ARK1 License Agreement.
On April 27, 2022, upon payment of $5.0 million, we entered into an agreement with SDE securing our rights to ARK 2 (“ARK2 License Agreement”), on terms similar to the ARK1 License Agreement, with an initial term continuing until December 31, 2037. Pursuant to the ARK2 License Agreement, once ARK 2 has commercially launched, we will begin making monthly payments of $1.5 million, a 25% royalty on ARK 2 and one-time payments of $5.0 million for each additional DLC developed pursuant to the ARK2 License Agreement. The $5.0 million up-front payment will be credited against any future monthly payments to SDE under the ARK2 License Agreement.
In addition to our primary licenses for the ARK franchise, we are also party to other licensing agreements with Suzhou Snail, relating to the intellectual property for our mobile games. Under these license agreements, we receive an exclusive, sublicensable license to use, publish, distribute, market, operate and service games from third parties. The license agreements call for the developers to develop a certain number of titles for us, while we are responsible for the operation and launch of such games including the marketing, strategy, billing, and server maintenance for such games. In these agreements, payment terms will frequently include royalty payments to developers in the low to mid double-digit percentages range and will occasionally include up-front licensing payments. Under these agreements, the developer will own all of the intellectual property, and the agreements can be terminated for breach with a period to cure, for insolvency, or for our nonpayment. In 2022 and 2021, we accrued $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in license costs, which we record as accounts payable - related party.
Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent

on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.
We are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education programs, and legislative activity around the world. For our PC products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.
