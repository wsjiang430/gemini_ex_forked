Business Description
 
CKX Lands, Inc., a Louisiana corporation, began operations in 1930 under the name Calcasieu Real Estate & Oil Co., Inc. It was originally organized as a spin-off by a bank operating in southwest Louisiana. The purpose of the spin-off was to form an entity to hold non-producing mineral interests which regulatory authorities required the bank to dispose of. Over the years, as some of the mineral interests began producing, the Company used part of the proceeds to acquire land. In 1990, the Company made its largest acquisition when it was one of four purchasers that bought a fifty percent undivided interest in approximately 35,575 acres in southwest Louisiana.
 
Today the Company’s income is derived from mineral royalties, timber sales and surface payments from its lands. CKX receives income from royalty interests and mineral leases related to oil and gas production, timber sales, and surface rents. Although CKX is active in the management of its land and planting and harvesting its timber, CKX is passive in the production of income from oil and gas activities in that CKX does not explore for oil and gas or operate wells. These oil and gas activities are performed by unrelated third parties.
 
Oil and gas royalties are paid by the operators who own the wells. Timber income is paid by the highest bidder for the timber. There are several mills that compete for timber. Surface income is received for farming, right of ways or other surface land uses. The prices paid for oil, gas and timber depend on national and international market conditions. Prices paid for surface leases depend on regional and local market conditions.
 
The source of all raw materials for the Company is the land itself. All oil and gas from our lands will eventually deplete, but we have no access to this depletion information. Timber and agriculture are renewable resources. The Company’s three reportable business segments are oil and gas, timber, and surface. Segment revenue and related business segment financial information are included in the notes to financial statements.
 
The Company’s oil and gas income fluctuates as new oil and gas production is discovered on Company land and then ultimately depletes or becomes commercially uneconomical to produce. The volatility in the daily commodity pricing of a barrel of oil or a thousand cubic feet (“MCF”) of gas will also cause fluctuations in the Company’s oil and gas income. Oil and gas revenues were 49% of the Company’s total revenues in 2018 and 53% in 2017.
 
CKX has small royalty interests in 29 different producing oil and gas fields. The size of each royalty interest is determined by the Company’s net ownership in the acreage unit for the well. CKX’s royalty interests range from 0.0045% for the smallest to 7.62% for the largest. As the Company does not own or operate the wells, it does not have access to any reserve information. 
 
Timber income is derived from sales of timber on Company lands. The timber income will fluctuate depending on our ability to secure stumpage agreements in the regional markets, timber stand age, and/or stumpage commodity prices. Timber is a renewable resource that the Company actively manages.

Surface income is earned from various recurring and non-recurring sources. Recurring surface income is earned from lease arrangements for farming, recreational and commercial uses. Non-recurring surface income can include such activities as pipeline right of ways, and temporary worksite rentals.
 
In managing its lands, the Company relies on and has established relationships with real estate, forestry, environmental and agriculture consultants as well as attorneys with legal expertise in general corporate matters, real estate, and minerals.
 
The Company actively searches for additional real estate for purchase in Louisiana with a focus on southwest Louisiana. When evaluating unimproved real estate for purchase, the Company will consider numerous characteristics including but not limited to timber fitness, agriculture fitness, future development opportunities and/or mineral potential. When evaluating improved real estate for purchase, the Company will consider characteristics including but not limited to geographic location, quality of existing revenue streams, and/or quality of the improvements. CKX owns a 100% interest in 7,500 acres and undivided interests ranging from 1.660% to 77.778% in 43,514 acres, resulting in an ownership of approximately 13,991 net acres.
 
CKX does not perform or cause to be performed oil and gas producing activities inasmuch as: (1) we do not search for crude oil or natural gas in their natural states; (2) we do not acquire property for the purpose of exploration or the removing of oil and gas; and (3) we are not involved in construction, drilling and/or production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas.
 
 The Company does not spend any money on research and development.
 
Employees
 
The Company has one employee, who is part-time. The Company is not subject to union contracts nor does the Company have any medical benefit, pension, profit sharing, option or deferred compensation programs.
Customers
 
The Company’s customers are those who have mineral leases on Company lands, purchase timber in competitive bids or execute surface leases for farming, hunting, right of ways or other purposes. During 2018, the Company received approximately 46.41% of its total revenues from the following customers:

Customer | Revenue Type | % of Total Revenue | 
------------------------------+--------------+--------------------+------
Louisiana Timber Procurement | Timber | | 21.26 | %
Pintail Oil & Gas, LLC | Oil & Gas | | 13.13 | %
Texegy Operating Company, LLC | Oil & Gas | | 7.83 | %
Universal Timber Services | Timber | | 7.83 | %

 
Loss of cash receipts from any of these customers or revenue streams would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Environmental and Other Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not need government approval of its principal products or services except that the State of Louisiana must permit the size and location of all oil and gas producing units. The operator of the oil and gas units is responsible for this permitting process.
 
The operators of the wells are responsible for complying with environmental and other governmental regulations. However, should an operator abandon a well located on Company land without following prescribed procedures, the land owners could possibly be held responsible. The Company does not believe this would have a material effect on its financial condition.
