Item 1. | Business

Overview of Lennar Corporation
We are the largest homebuilder in the United States in terms of consolidated revenue, an originator of residential and commercial mortgage loans, and a developer of multifamily rental properties in various U.S. markets primarily through unconsolidated entities. In addition, we are involved in ventures, and have interests in companies, that are engaged in applying technology to purchasing, residing in and selling homes.
Our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising $19.1 billion in revenues, or approximately 93% of consolidated revenues, in fiscal 2018. 
As of November 30, 2018, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other had divisions located in:
East: Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, and South Carolina
Central: Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia
Texas: Texas
West: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington
Other: Urban divisions and other homebuilding related investments, including FivePoint
Our other reportable segments are Lennar Financial Services, Lennar Multifamily and Rialto. Financial information about our Homebuilding, Lennar Financial Services, Lennar Multifamily and Rialto operations, including our former Rialto Capital Management investment and asset management platform ("Rialto Management Group"), which we sold on November 30, 2018, is contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is Item 7 of this Report, and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report. As of December 1, 2018, our reportable segments in addition to homebuilding were Lennar Financial Services, including Rialto Mortgage Finance ("RMF"), Lennar Multifamily and Corporate and Other.
A Brief History of Our Company
Our company was founded as a local Miami homebuilder in 1954. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. During the 1980s and 1990s, we entered and expanded operations in a number of homebuilding markets, including California, Florida and Texas, through both organic growth and acquisitions, such as Pacific Greystone Corporation in 1997. In 2000, we acquired U.S. Home Corporation, which expanded our operations into New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado and strengthened our position in other states. From 2002 through 2005, we acquired several regional homebuilders, which brought us into new markets and strengthened our position in several existing markets. From 2010 through 2013, we expanded our homebuilding operations into Georgia, Oregon, Washington and Tennessee. In 2017, we acquired WCI Communities, Inc. ("WCI"), a homebuilder of luxury single and multifamily homes, including a small number of luxury high-rise tower units, in Florida. In February 2018, we acquired CalAtlantic Group, Inc. ("CalAtlantic"), a major homebuilder which was building homes across the homebuilding spectrum, from entry level to luxury, in 43 metropolitan statistical areas spanning 19 states, and providing mortgage, title and escrow services. As a result, we became the nation's largest homebuilder in terms of consolidated revenues, with fiscal year 2018 revenues of $20.6 billion. 
We are currently focused on maintaining moderate growth in community count and homes sales, reducing homebuilding costs through volume purchasing, increasing the efficiencies in our building process and reducing selling, general and administrative expenses by using technology and innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs. We are also focused on a soft-pivot land strategy, shortening the average time between when we acquire land and when we expect to begin building homes on it. This decreases the percentage of homesites we need to purchase outright versus control through options or other arrangements, as well as increases the rate of return on our homebuilding investment and generating net cash flow. In addition we are focused on our strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies.
In 2017, we decided to increase our focus on our core homebuilding and related finance businesses, and to dispose of some of our non-core businesses. During fiscal 2018 and the early part of 2019, we disposed of our Rialto Management Group, the majority of our retail title business, our title insurance underwriting business and our real estate brokerage business and contracted to sell our business of offering residential mortgages to non-Lennar homebuyers.
In addition to focusing on growing our core operating platforms, Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Financial Services, we have also been focusing on maximizing the value of our other businesses, including Lennar Multifamily, our approximately 40% interest in FivePoint Holdings, LLC ("FivePoint"), a publicly traded company that is developing three large multi-use planned developments in California, and our strategic investments in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies.
Homebuilding Operations
Overview
Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. New home deliveries, including deliveries from unconsolidated entities, were 45,627 in fiscal 2018, compared to 29,394 in fiscal 2017 and 26,563 in fiscal 2016. The increase in fiscal 2018 resulted primarily from the acquisition of CalAtlantic in February 2018. We primarily sell single-family attached and detached homes in communities targeted to first-time, move-up, active adult, and luxury homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home varies depending on product and geographic location. For fiscal 2018, the average sales price, excluding deliveries from unconsolidated entities, was $413,000, compared to $376,000 in fiscal 2017 and $361,000 in fiscal 2016.
We operate primarily under the Lennar brand name. Our homebuilding mission is focused on the profitable development of residential communities. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Strong Operating Margins - We believe our purchasing leverage combined with our attractive land purchases position us for strong operating margins.


• | Everything’s Included® Approach - We are focused on distinguishing our products, including through our Everything’s Included® approach, which maximizes our purchasing power, enables us to include luxury features as standard items in our homes and simplifies our homebuilding operations.


• | Innovative Homebuilding - We are constantly innovating the homes we build to create products that better meet our customers' needs and desires. Our Next Gen® home, or a home within a home, provides a unique new home solution for multi-generational households as homebuyers often need to accommodate children and parents to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses.


• | Flexible Operating Structure - Our local operating structure gives us the flexibility to make operating decisions based on local homebuilding conditions and customer preferences, while our centralized management structure provides oversight for our homebuilding operations.


• | Digital Marketing - We are increasingly advertising homes through digital channels, which is significantly increasing the efficiency of our marketing efforts.


• | Strategic partners and investments - We partner with and/or invest in technology companies that are looking to improve the homebuilding and financial services industry to better serve our customers and increase efficiencies.


• | Soft-pivot land strategy - We are focused on shortening the average time between when we acquire land and when we expect to begin building homes on it.

Diversified Program of Property Acquisition
We generally acquire land for development and for the construction of homes that we sell to homebuyers. Land purchases are subject to specified underwriting criteria and are made through our diversified program of property acquisition, which may consist of:

• | Acquiring land directly from individual land owners/developers or homebuilders;


• | Acquiring local or regional homebuilders that own, or have options to purchase, land in strategic markets;


• | Acquiring land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments until we have determined whether to exercise the options;


• | Acquiring parcels of land through joint ventures or partnerships, which among other benefits, limits the amount of our capital invested in land while helping to ensure our access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures;


• | Investing in regional developers in exchange for preferential land purchase opportunities; and


• | Acquiring land in conjunction with Lennar Multifamily.

At November 30, 2018, we owned 201,648 homesites and had access through option contracts to an additional 68,623 homesites, of which 59,289 homesites were through option contracts with third parties and 9,334 homesites were through 
option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At November 30, 2017, we owned 141,126 homesites and had access through option contracts to an additional 37,527 homesites, of which 32,082 homesites were through option contracts with third parties and 5,445 homesites were through option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which we had investments.
Construction and Development
Through our own efforts and those of unconsolidated entities in which Lennar Homebuilding has investments, we are involved in all phases of planning and building in our residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and improvement of land and design, construction and marketing of homes. We use independent subcontractors for most aspects of home construction. At November 30, 2018, we were actively building and marketing homes in 1,329 communities, including five communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities. This was an increase from 765 communities, including four communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities, in which we were actively building and marketing homes at November 30, 2017.
We generally supervise and control the development of land and the design and building of our residential communities with a relatively small labor force. We hire subcontractors for site improvements and virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. Arrangements with our subcontractors generally provide that our subcontractors will complete specified work in accordance with price and time schedules and in compliance with applicable building codes and laws. The price schedules may be subject to change to meet changes in labor and material costs or for other reasons. Although homebuilders throughout the country have recently encountered shortages of materials and skilled labor, because of our size we have been less affected by these shortages than many of our competitors. We believe that the current sources and availability of raw materials and labor to our subcontractors are in most locations adequate for our planned levels of operation. We generally do not own heavy construction equipment. We finance construction and land development activities primarily with cash generated from operations and corporate debt.
For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.
Marketing
We offer a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up, active adult, luxury and multi-generational homebuyers in a variety of locations ranging from urban infill communities to suburban golf course communities. Our Everything’s Included® marketing program simplifies the home buying experience by including the most desirable features as standard items. This marketing program enables us to differentiate our homes from those of our competitors by including luxury items as standard features at competitive pricing, while reducing construction and overhead costs through a simplified construction process, product standardization and volume purchasing. In addition, we include solar power, built in wireless capability and home automation in many of the homes we sell, which enhances our brand and improves our ability to generate traffic and sales.
We sell our homes primarily from models that we have designed and constructed. We employ new home consultants who are paid salaries, commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of our homes. We also sell homes through independent realtors.
Most recently our marketing strategy has increasingly involved advertising through digital channels including paid search, display advertising, social media and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to our website, www.lennar.com. This has allowed us to attract more qualified and knowledgeable homebuyers and has helped us reduce our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. However, we also continue to advertise through more traditional media, including newspapers, radio advertisements and other local and regional publications and on billboards where appropriate. We tailor our marketing strategy and message based on the community being advertised and the customers being targeted, such as advertising our active adult communities in areas where prospective active adult homebuyers live or will potentially want to purchase.
Quality Service
We continually strive to improve homeowner customer satisfaction throughout the pre-sale, sale, construction, closing and post-closing periods. We strive to create a quality home buying experience for our customers through the participation of sales associates, on-site construction supervisors and customer care associates, all working in a team effort, which we believe leads to enhanced customer retention and referrals. The quality of our homes is substantially affected by the efforts of on-site management and others engaged in the construction process, by the materials we use in particular homes, and by other similar factors.
We warrant our new homes against defective materials and workmanship for a minimum period of one year after the date of closing. Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the 
subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to the homebuyers for the correction of any deficiencies.
Local Operating Structure and Centralized Management
We balance a local operating structure with centralized corporate level management. Our local operating structure consists of homebuilding divisions across the country, each of which is usually managed by a division president, a controller and personnel focused on land entitlement, acquisition and development, sales, construction, customer service and purchasing. This local operating structure gives our division presidents and their teams, who generally have significant experience in the homebuilding industry, and in most instances, in their particular markets, the flexibility to make local operating decisions, including land identification, entitlement and development, the management of inventory levels for our current sales volume, community development, home design, construction and marketing of our homes. We centralize at the corporate level decisions related to our overall strategy, acquisitions of land and businesses, risk management, financing, cash management and information systems.
Backlog
Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of 15% in both 2018 and 2017, and 16% in 2016. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. 
The backlog dollar value including unconsolidated entities at November 30, 2018 was $6.6 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at November 30, 2017 and $2.9 billion at November 30, 2016. We expect that substantially all homes currently in backlog will be delivered in fiscal year 2019.
Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities
We create and participate in joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for use in the ventures' own homebuilding operations. Through these joint ventures, we reduce the amount we invest in potential future homesites, thereby reducing risks associated with land acquisitions, and, in some instances, we obtain access to land to which we could not otherwise have obtained access or could not have obtained access on as favorable terms. As of November 30, 2018 and 2017, we had 59 and 38 Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively, in which we were participating, and our maximum recourse debt exposure related to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures was $65.7 million and $69.2 million, respectively. At November 30, 2018, the 59 unconsolidated joint ventures includes 20 unconsolidated entities in which CalAtlantic or a subsidiary is the participant. This is discussed in greater detail in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.
FivePoint - We own an approximately 40% interest in FivePoint, the publicly traded developer of three large master planned mixed-use developments in California (Newhall Ranch, Great Park Neighborhoods, and the San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point). As of November 30, 2018, the carrying amount of our investment in FivePoint was $342.7 million.
Homebuilding Ancillary Businesses
We have ancillary business activities that are related to our homebuilding business, but are not components of our core homebuilding operations.
Sunstreet - Our solar business is focused on providing homeowners through solar purchases or lease programs, high-efficiency solar power systems that generate much of a home's annual expected energy needs. In fiscal 2018, Sunstreet operated in California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Washington. During the year ended November 30, 2017, we monetized $200 million of future lease payments related to solar systems. 
Strategic Technology Investments - We strategically invest in technology initiatives that help us enhance the homebuying experience, reduce our SG&A and stay at the forefront of homebuilding innovation. Our strategic investments include Opendoor, a company that uses technology to streamline the home buying and selling process; Blend, a company that provides a digital mortgage application platform; Hippo Analytics, a company that provides home insurance in a more efficient and effective way; States Title, a company that builds a predictive analytics platform for title insurers; and Notarize, a company that provides online notarizations. At November 30, 2018, our investment in strategic technology ventures was $117.6 million.

Lennar Financial Services Operations
Residential Mortgage Financing
We offer conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other home mortgage products primarily to buyers of our homes through our financial services subsidiary, Eagle Home Mortgage, LLC, from locations in most of the states in which we have homebuilding operations, as well as some other states. In 2018, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to 73% of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing in areas where we offered services. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from our financial services subsidiaries, as well as from independent mortgage lenders, we believe almost all credit worthy potential purchasers of our homes have access to financing.
During 2018, we originated approximately 36,500 residential mortgage loans totaling $11.1 billion, compared to 31,600 residential mortgage loans totaling $9.0 billion during 2017. Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, a majority of them on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Occasional claims of this type are a normal incident of our loan securitization activities. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position.
We finance our mortgage loan activities with borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities or from our operating funds. At November 30, 2018, Lennar Financial Services had four warehouse facilities maturing at various dates through fiscal 2019 with a total maximum aggregate commitment of $1.9 billion including an uncommitted amount of $950 million. We expect the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. We have a corporate risk management policy under which we hedge our interest rate risk on rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
Title and Other Insurance and Closing Services
During 2018, we provided title insurance and closing services to our homebuyers and others in approximately 118,000 real estate transactions, and issued approximately 297,600 title insurance policies through our underwriter subsidiary, North American Title Insurance Company, compared to approximately 110,000 real estate transactions and 314,800 title insurance policies during 2017. Title and closing services by our insurance agency subsidiaries are provided in 35 states. Title insurance services are provided in 39 states. In December 2018, we agreed to sell to States Title the majority of our retail title insurance business and underwriting business in return for, among other consideration, an ownership interest in States Title. We retained our title agency business that provides services to our homebuyers and rebranded it as CalAtlantic Title.
During 2018, we also provided our homebuyers and others with personal lines, property and casualty insurance products through our insurance agency subsidiary, North American Advantage Insurance Services, LLC, which operates in the same states as our homebuilding divisions, as well as other states. During 2018 and 2017, we issued, as agent, approximately 19,800 and 12,800 new homeowner policies, respectively, and renewed approximately 37,400 and 26,500 homeowner policies, respectively.
Commercial Mortgage Origination
 Our RMF subsidiary originates and sells into securitizations five, seven and ten year first mortgage loans, which are secured by income producing commercial properties. RMF also originates floating rate loans secured by commercial real estate properties, many of which are undergoing transition, including properties undergoing lease-up, sell-out and renovation or repositioning. In order to finance RMF lending activities, as of November 30, 2018, RMF had five warehouse repurchase financing agreements maturing between November 2019 and December 2019 with commitments totaling $900 million, which includes $50 million for floating rate loans. Prior to the sale of our Rialto Management Group on November 30, 2018, RMF was part of the Rialto operations, but, effective December 1, 2018, RMF became part of Lennar Financial Services.
Lennar Multifamily Operations
We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.
Our Lennar Multifamily segment is one of the largest developers of apartment communities across the country. At November 30, 2018, it had interests in 55 communities with development costs of approximately $6.3 billion, of which 23 communities were completed and operating, 5 communities were partially completed and leasing, 19 communities were under construction and the remaining communities were either owned or under contract. As of November 30, 2018, our Lennar Multifamily segment had a pipeline of future projects totaling $3.5 billion in anticipated development costs across a number of states that will be developed primarily by unconsolidated entities. 
5

Our Lennar Multifamily segment had equity investments in 22 and 27 unconsolidated entities (including the Lennar Multifamily Ventures, described below) as of November 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended November 30, 2018, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold, through its unconsolidated entities, 6 operating properties and an investment in an operating property resulting in the segment's $61.2 million share of gains. During both years ended November 30, 2017 and 2016, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold seven operating properties, through its unconsolidated entities, resulting in the segment's $96.7 million and $91.0 million share of gains, respectively.
Originally, our Lennar Multifamily segment focused on building multifamily properties and selling them shortly after they were completed. However, more recently we have focused on creating and participating in ventures that build multifamily properties with the intention of retaining them after they are completed. The Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund I LP (the "Venture Fund") is a long-term multifamily development investment vehicle involved in the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets with $2.2 billion in equity commitments, including a $504 million co-investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. As of November 30, 2018, $1.8 billion of the $2.2 billion in equity commitments had been called, of which we had contributed our share of $440.8 million, resulting in a remaining equity commitment by us of $63.2 million.
In March 2018, the Lennar Multifamily segment completed the first closing of a second Lennar Multifamily Venture, Lennar Multifamily Venture Fund II LP ("Venture Fund II") for the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets. As of November 30, 2018, Venture II had received $787 million of equity commitments, including a $255 million co-investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. As of November 30, 2018, $252.1 million in equity commitments were called, of which we had contributed our share of $81.2 million, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for the Company of $173.8 million. Venture II is currently seeded with eight undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased by our Lennar Multifamily segment, which will contain approximately 3,000 apartments with projected project costs of approximately $1.3 billion. 
For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.
Former Rialto Capital Management Operations
Until November 30, 2018, we had a group of subsidiaries, including Rialto Capital Management, LLC, that primarily managed real estate related investment funds and other real estate related investment vehicles. We sold the Rialto Management Group on November 30, 2018. However, we retained the right to receive carried interest distributions from some of the funds and other investment vehicles. We also retained limited partner investments in Rialto funds and investment vehicles that totaled $297.4 million as of November 30, 2018, and are committed to invest as much as an additional $71.6 million in Rialto funds.
Seasonality
We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.
Competition
The residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. In each of the market regions where we operate, we compete for homebuyers with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders, as well as with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including location, price, reputation, amenities, design, quality and financing. In addition to competition for homebuyers, we also compete with other homebuilders for desirable properties, raw materials and access to reliable, skilled labor. We compete with a wide variety of property owners in our efforts to sell land to homebuilders and others. We believe we are competitive in the market regions where we operate primarily due to our:

• | Everything’s Included® marketing program, which simplifies the home buying experience by including most desirable features as standard items;


• | Innovative home designs, such as our Next Gen® homes that provide both privacy and togetherness for multi-generational families;


• | Inclusion of built-in Wi-Fi and advanced technology in many of our homes;


• | Financial position, where we continue to focus on inventory management and liquidity;


• | Access to land, particularly in land-constrained markets;


• | Pricing to current market conditions through sales incentives offered to homebuyers;


• | Cost efficiencies realized through our national purchasing programs and production of value-engineered homes; and


• | Quality construction and home warranty programs, which are supported by a responsive customer care team.


• | Our size and scale in leading markets

Our residential financial services operations compete with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and brokers, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions, in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. Principal competitive factors include service and price.
Our RMF commercial mortgage origination and sale business competes with a wide variety of banks and other lenders that offer small and mid-sized mortgage loans to commercial enterprises. Competition is based primarily on service, price and relationships with mortgage brokers and other referral sources. RMF is run by highly seasoned managers who have been originating and securitizing loans for over 27 years and can benefit from long-standing relationships with referral sources, as well as being able to leverage Lennar's infrastructure facilities for rapid market entrances and analysis. We believe these factors give RMF an advantage over many of the lenders with which it competes. Additionally, we believe access to Lennar's local homebuilding teams provides RMF with a distinct advantage in its evaluation of real estate assets.
Our multifamily operations compete with other multifamily apartment developers and operators, including REITs, across the United States. In addition, our multifamily operations compete in securing capital, partners and equity, and in securing tenants within the large supply of already existing rental apartments. Principal competitive factors include location, rental price and quality, and management of the apartment buildings.
Regulation
The residential communities and multifamily apartment developments that we build are subject to a large variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, zoning, construction permits or entitlements, construction materials, density, building design and property elevation, building codes and handling of waste. These include laws requiring the use of construction materials that reduce the need for energy-consuming heating and cooling systems. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often increase construction costs. For example, the California Energy Commission recently adopted a requirement that beginning in 2020, most newly built homes in California must have rooftop solar panels. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure, and may require them to be in place prior to the commencement of new construction. These laws and regulations are usually administered by counties and municipalities and may result in fees and assessments or building moratoriums. In addition, certain new development projects are subject to assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public improvements, the costs of which can be substantial. Also, some states are attempting to make homebuilders responsible for violations of wage and other labor laws by their subcontractors.
Residential homebuilding and apartment development are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These environmental laws include such areas as storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws and existing conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. For example, a 2015 decision of the California Supreme Court significantly delayed the start, and increased the cost of a California master planned mixed-use development by a company in which we have a significant investment.
Over the years, several cities and counties in which we have developments have submitted to voters "slow growth" initiatives and other ballot measures that could impact the affordability and availability of land suitable for residential development within those localities. Although many of these initiatives have been defeated, we believe that if similar initiatives were approved, residential construction by us and others within certain cities or counties could be seriously impacted.
In order to make it possible for some of our homebuyers to obtain FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct the homes they buy in compliance with regulations promulgated by those agencies. Various states have statutory disclosure requirements relating to the marketing and sale of new homes. These disclosure requirements vary widely from state-to-state. In addition, some states require that each new home be registered with the state at or before the time title is transferred to a buyer (e.g., the Texas Residential Construction Commission Act). In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. In various states, our new home consultants are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents and to adhere to the laws governing the practices of real estate agents.
Our mortgage and title subsidiaries must comply with applicable real estate, lending and insurance laws and regulations. The subsidiaries are licensed in the states in which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments, lending 
and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitizations. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations.
Several federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or to some state statutes that govern debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities, our failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding residential mortgage loans.
Associates
At November 30, 2018, we employed 11,626 individuals (excluding persons employed by Rialto Management Group which was sold on that day) of whom 7,844 were involved in the Lennar Homebuilding operations, 3,230 were involved in the Lennar Financial Services operations, 518 were involved in the Lennar Multifamily operations and 34 were involved in the RMF operations, compared to November 30, 2017, when we employed 9,111 individuals of whom 4,900 were involved in the Lennar Homebuilding operations, 3,414 were involved in the Lennar Financial Services operations, 462 were involved in the Lennar Multifamily operations and 335 were involved in our former Rialto operations (including RMF). The sale of the majority of our retail title business, title insurance underwriter and Berkshire Hathaway real estate brokerage business in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 will result in a reduction in our associates of approximately 1,600 individuals that are involved in these businesses. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates. However, we subcontract many phases of our homebuilding operations and some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are represented by labor unions.
