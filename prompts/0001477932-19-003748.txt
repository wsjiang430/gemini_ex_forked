Item 1. Business.
General

FCCC, Inc. (OTC.QB “FCIC”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut on May 6, 1960 under the name The First Connecticut Small Business Investment Company. The Company changed its name to The First Connecticut Capital Corporation on January 27, 1993, and then to FCCC, Inc. on June 4, 2003. The Company maintains its principal executive offices at 1650 West 106th Street, Carmel, Indiana, 46203, Telephone Number 317-860-8213. FCCC is authorized to issue 22,000,000 shares of common stock, no par value. The Company had 3,461,022 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at March 31, 2019.

The Company has had limited operations since June 30, 2003, and is a “shell company” as defined in Rule 13b-2 of the Exchange Act. Such operations consist of a search for appropriate transactions such as a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or other business combination with an operating business or other appropriate financial transaction. See “Current Business” below.

Current Business

Since June 2003, the Company’s operations consist of a search for a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or a business transaction opportunity with an operating business or other financial transaction; however, there can be no assurance that this plan will be successfully implemented. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. Accordingly, during this period we do not expect to achieve sufficient income to offset our operating expenses, resulting in operating losses that may require us to use and thereby reduce our limited cash balance. Until we complete a merger, reverse merger or other financial transaction, and unless interest rates increase dramatically, we expect to incur a loss of between $15,000 to $18,000 for the first quarter and thereafter of between $11,000 to $13,000 per quarter. The increase in first quarter expenses relates to a Company audit and tax return. At this time, the Company has no binding arrangements with respect to any potential merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination candidate pursuant to which it may become an operating company. 

Opportunities may come to FCCC’s attention from various sources, including its management, its stockholders, professional advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. At this time, FCCC has no plans, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual or entity to act as a finder in regard to any business opportunities for it. While it is not currently anticipated that the Company will engage unaffiliated professional firms specializing in business acquisitions, reorganizations or other such transactions, such firms may be retained if such arrangements are deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Compensation to a finder or business acquisition firm may take various forms, including one-time cash payments, payments involving issuance of securities (including those of the Company), or any combination of these or other compensation arrangements. Consequently, the Company is currently unable to predict the cost of utilizing such services.

The Company has not restricted its search to any particular business, industry, or geographical location. In evaluating a potential transaction, the Company analyzes all available factors and makes a determination based on a composite of available facts, without reliance on any single factor.

It is not possible at this time to predict the nature of a transaction in which the Company may participate. Specific business opportunities would be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable would be selected. In implementing a structure for a particular transaction, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, tender offer, joint venture, license, purchase and sale of assets, or purchase and sale of stock, or other arrangement the exact nature of which cannot now be predicted. Additionally, the Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of FCCC with other business organizations and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management and stockholders of the Company may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of FCCC following reorganization or other financial transaction. As part of such a transaction, some or all of FCCC’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed. The Company’s operations following its consummation of a transaction will be dependent on the nature of the transaction. There may also be various risks inherent in the transaction, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted.

The Company may also be subject to increased governmental regulation following a transaction; however, it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or magnitude of such increased regulation, if any.

The Company does not have any arrangements with banks or financial institutions with respect to the availability of financing in the future. 

The payment of any cash distributions is subject to the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. At this time the Company has no plans to pay any additional cash distributions in the foreseeable future. 

Competition

FCCC is in direct competition with many other entities in its efforts to locate a suitable transaction. Included in the competition are business development companies, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), venture capital firms, small business investment companies, venture capital affiliates of industrial and financial companies, broker-dealers and investment bankers, management consultant firms and private individual investors. Many of these entities possess greater financial resources and are able to assume greater risks than those which FCCC could consider. Many of these competing entities also possess significantly greater experience and contacts than FCCC’s management. Moreover, FCCC also competes with numerous other companies similar to it for such opportunities.
Employees and Consultants

The Company currently has two executive officers. Frederick Farrar serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Daniel R. Loftus serves as Secretary. 

Management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and it is not expected that FCCC will have any full-time or other employees, except as may be the result of completing a transaction.
