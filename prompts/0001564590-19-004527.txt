Overview 
 
We are a television broadcasting and digital media company focused on the acquisition, development and operation of television stations and interactive community websites and digital media services in 100 designated market areas throughout the United States. 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 174 full power television stations, including those owned by VIEs, in 100 markets in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MNTV and other broadcast television networks. As of December 31, 2018, we reached approximately 42.7 million, or 38.8%, of all U.S. television households.
 
The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over-the-air programming to our markets’ television viewing audiences. This programming includes (a) programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated; (b) programs that the stations produce; and (c) first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our television stations’ primary sources of revenue include the sale of commercial air time on our stations to local and national advertisers, the sale of advertising on our websites in each of our broadcast markets where we deliver community focused content, and revenues earned from our retransmission consent agreements with traditional multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and satellite providers, and over-the-top video distributors (“OTTDs”), companies that provide video content through internet streaming.
 
Our digital media businesses provide digital publishing and content management platform, digital video advertising platform, social media advertising platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms.
 
We seek to grow our revenue and operating income by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, as well as through our growing portfolio of digital products and services. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations’ strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by owning or providing services to stations affiliated with multiple networks, capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. As a result of our operational enhancements, we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations. 
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1996. Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv.

Recent Acquisitions 
 On January 16, 2018, we acquired the outstanding equity of Likqid Media Inc. (“LKQD”), a video advertising infrastructure company. The purchase price was $97.0 million in cash, including working capital adjustments, of which $94.0 million was paid in January 2018 and the remaining $3.0 million was paid upon final settlement in April 2018. The purchase price was funded by a combination of borrowing under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand.
 On July 15, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of the CW affiliated television station WHDF from Huntsville TV, LLC (“Huntsville TV”), for $3.0 million in cash, including working capital adjustments. On July 15, 2018, we completed the first closing of the acquisition and acquired the station’s assets excluding certain transmission equipment, Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licenses and network affiliation agreement for $2.3 million, funded by cash on hand. We completed the second closing on November 9, 2018, acquiring the remaining assets and paying the remaining purchase price of $0.7 million. We provided programming and sales and other services to WHDF pursuant to a TBA from July 15, 2018 until the completion of our acquisition on November 9, 2018.
 On August 1, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of the FOX affiliated television station KRBK from KRBK LLC for $17.6 million in cash, including working capital adjustments.

We provided programming and sales services to KRBK pursuant to a TBA from August 1, 2018 until the completion of our acquisition on November 1, 2018.
 On November 1, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the FCC license, certain transmission equipment and network affiliation agreement of KHII, formerly KFVE, (“KHII”) from HITV License Subsidiary, Inc. (“HITV”), the MNTV affiliate serving Honolulu, Hawaii and its satellite stations KGMV serving Wailuku, Hawaii and KGMD serving Hilo, Hawaii. The purchase price is $6.5 million, of which $0.1 million was paid on November 1, 2018. The acquisition received FCC approval on December 17, 2018. We completed the acquisition on January 28, 2019 and paid the remaining purchase price of $6.4 million. Effective November 1, 2018, we began providing programming and sales services to KHII under a TBA until the completion of our acquisition on January 28, 2019.
 Merger Agreement with Tribune
 On November 30, 2018, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Tribune Media Company (“Tribune”) to acquire Tribune’s outstanding equity for $46.50 per share in a cash transaction. All equity-based awards of Tribune that are outstanding prior to the merger will vest in full and will be converted into the right to receive the same cash consideration. The estimated total purchase price is valued at $6.4 billion, consisting of the merger cash consideration and the refinancing of Tribune's outstanding debt. Tribune shareholders will be entitled to additional cash consideration of approximately $0.30 per share per month if the transaction has not closed by August 31, 2019, pro-rated for partial months and less an adjustment for any dividends declared on or after September 1, 2019. Tribune currently owns, operates or provides services to 42 television stations. 
 
The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Tribune. If the merger agreement is terminated in connection with Tribune entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, as well as under certain other circumstances, the termination fee payable by Tribune to us will be $135 million. If the merger agreement is terminated because the required Tribune stockholder vote is not obtained at a stockholder meeting duly held for such purpose, Tribune will be required to reimburse us for our costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction in an amount not to exceed $15 million. Either party may terminate the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated on or before an end date of November 30, 2019, with an automatic extension to February 29, 2020, if necessary to obtain regulatory approval under circumstances specified in the merger agreement.
 
The merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is projected to close late in the third quarter of 2019, subject to (i) the approval of the merger by the stockholders of Tribune, (ii) FCC approval, (iii) other regulatory approvals (including expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino “HSR” waiting period) and (iv) satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The merger does not require approval of our stockholders and is not subject to any financing contingency. On November 30, 2018, we received committed financing up to a maximum of $6.4 billion from a group of commercial banks to provide the debt financing to consummate the merger and the refinancing of certain of the existing indebtedness of Tribune and related transactions.

In connection with obtaining the HSR approval and the FCC approval, Nexstar agreed to divest one or more television stations in certain DMAs. Those DMAs are: (i) Salt Lake City, UT; (ii) Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, MI; (iii) Wilkes Barre-Scranton, PA; (iv) Richmond-Petersburg, VA; (v) Des Moines-Ames, IA; (vi) Norfolk-Portsmouth-Newport News, VA; (vii) Fort Smith-Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers, AR; (viii) Davenport, IA-Rock Island-Moline, IL; (ix) Memphis, TN; (x) Huntsville-Decatur (Florence), AL; (xi) Indianapolis, IN; (xii) Hartford-New Haven, CT and (xiii) Harrisburg, PA. Nexstar is required to designate one or more Tribune stations or Nexstar stations for divestiture in each DMA. Nexstar has also agreed to designate, at its option, certain additional Tribune stations or Nexstar stations for divestiture and to divest such stations in order to comply with the FCC national cap as required by the FCC in order to obtain approval of and consummate the transactions. 
 Operating Strategy 
 We seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies: 
 Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. Based on internally generated analysis, we believe that in over 72.5% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we earned approximately 37.9% of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to that produce local newscasts provide between 15 and 30 hours per week of local news programming. Extensive local sports coverage, active sponsorship of community events and the local news stories our Washington, D.C. bureau focuses on further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal. 
 Invest in Digital Media. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services. Our station websites provide access to our local news and information, as well as community centric businesses and services. We delivered to audiences across all of our station web sites in 2018, with 199 million unique visitors who utilized over 5.0 billion page views. Also in 2018, our mobile websites and mobile application accounted for 36% and 46%, respectively, of our station websites’ overall page views by year end. We have also invested in additional digital media product lines, including a digital video advertising platform acquired in early 2018 and other digital media solutions. We are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want.
 Emphasize Local Sales. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. Additionally, local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue generated from local advertising represented 73.2% of our consolidated spot revenue (total of local and national advertising revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period. 
 Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 61.4% of our net revenue, excluding trade revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from our duopoly markets. 
 Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to. 

7

Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations. We currently own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliated stations which represented approximately 18.3%, 28.8%, 33.0% and 10.2%, respectively, of our 2018 combined local, national and political net revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NBA basketball, Major League baseball, NFL football, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network programming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio’s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network. 
 Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets. Most of our station general managers have been granted restricted stock units and stock options and have an average of over 20 years of experience in the television broadcasting industry. 
Acquisition Strategy 
 We selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management. When considering an acquisition, we evaluate the target audience share, revenue share, overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters. Additionally, we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets. We selectively pursue acquisitions of digital properties that leverage our capabilities particularly in video delivery technology and platforms and with a focus on assisting small and medium-sized businesses to effectively reach targeted consumers and achieve effective marketing campaigns.
 
Relationship with VIEs
 Through various local service agreements, as of December 31, 2018, we provided sales, programming and other services to 38 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2018, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs’ stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantees of the obligations incurred under Mission Broadcasting, Inc.’s (“Mission”), Marshall Broadcasting Group, Inc.’s (“Marshall”) and Shield Media LLC’s (“Shield”) senior secured credit facilities, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE, exclusive of Marshall, which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of the consolidated VIEs’ stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2021 and 2028. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements.

Industry Background 
 Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by The Nielsen Company, LLC, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as DMAs, that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates. 
 Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs. 
 Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, cable and satellite television systems, OTTDs, Google, Facebook and other online media, newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the Internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations. 
 Advertising Sales 
 General 
 Television station revenue is substantially derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming. 
 Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station’s local sales staff. 
 Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including: 
  
• | a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of advertisers competing for the available time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of alternative advertising media in the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effectiveness of the station’s sales force;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Advertising rates are also determined by a station’s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station’s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations. 
 13

Seasonality 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns, and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. 
Local Sales 
 Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel. 
National Sales 
 National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may advertise locally). 
Compensation for Retransmission Consent
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OTTDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and OTTDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with these distributors have created agreements that now produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams.
Network Affiliations 
 Except for WDVM (independent station), all of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to as of December 31, 2018 are affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The agreements with ABC, FOX, NBC and CBS are the most significant to our operations. The terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

Network Affiliations | Expiration Date 
ABC | 30 agreements expire in December 2022. 
FOX | Of the 32 agreements, one expires in June 2019, 30 expire in December 2019 and one(1) expires in December 2020. 
NBC | Of the 33 agreements, 18 expire in December 2019 and 15 expire in December 2020. 
CBS | Of the 46 agreements, 18 expire in in August 2019, one expires in December 2019, one expires in February 2020, 10 expire in June 2020, one expires in January 2021, two expire in June 2021 and 13 expire in December 2021.


(1) | The affiliation agreement is owned by a station to which we provide sales and other services. We do not consolidate this station in our financial statements due to lack of a controlling financial interest.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.

14

Competition 
 Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 Audience. We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station’s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to provide their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices, such as tablets and cell phones, which present an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems (such as DVDs and DVRs), video-on-demand and pay-per-view, the Internet (including network distribution of programming through websites and mobile platforms) and gaming devices.
 Although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems, such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) systems and video streaming services, which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market, have become significant competitors for the over-the-air television audience.
 Programming. Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off-network reruns (such as Two and a Half Men) and first-run product (such as Entertainment Tonight) in their respective markets. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Warner Media, LLC, Comcast Corporation, Viacom Inc., CBS Corporation, The News Corporation Limited and the Walt Disney Company each owns a television network and multiple cable networks and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary sources of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved from or to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. 
 Advertising. Stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, MVPDs, OTTDs and online media (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.). Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. 
 
The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. An increase in the popularity of OTTDs may result in popular product offerings that do not include television broadcast stations. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services. 

15

Federal Regulation 
 Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, you should refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies. 
 License Grant and Renewal. The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application. 
 In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture. 
 Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC’s processing of a timely renewal application. 
 Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval. 
 Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company unless the FCC determines the public interest will not be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. The FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. In September 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and reformed the methodology that publicly traded broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. 
 The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations. These ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar.

The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity.” In August 2016, the FCC adopted a Second Report and Order (the “2016 Ownership Order”) concluding the agency’s 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews.  The 2016 Ownership Order (1) retained the then-existing local television ownership rule and radio/television cross-ownership rule with minor technical modifications, (2) extended the ban on common ownership of two top-four television stations in a market to network affiliation swaps, (3) retained the then-existing ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership in local markets while considering waivers and providing an exception for failed or failing entities, (4) retained the dual network rule, (5) made JSA relationships attributable interests and (6) defined a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between stations and required public disclosure of those SSAs (while not considering them attributable). Nexstar and other parties filed petitions seeking reconsideration of various aspects of the 2016 Ownership Order.  On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted an order (the “Reconsideration Order”) addressing the petitions for reconsideration.  The Reconsideration Order (1) eliminated the rules prohibiting newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership and limiting television/radio cross-ownership, (2) eliminated the requirement that eight or more independently-owned television stations remain in a market for common ownership of two television stations in the market to be permissible, (3) retained the general prohibition on common ownership of two “top four” stations in a local market but provided for case-by-case review, (4) eliminated the television JSA attribution rule, and (5) retained the SSA definition and disclosure requirement for television stations.  These rule modifications took effect on February 7, 2018, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the “Third Circuit”) denied a mandamus petition which had sought to stay their effectiveness.  The Reconsideration Order’s rule modifications (a) could allow Nexstar to acquire a second television station in certain markets where ownership of two television stations was not previously permitted, (b) allow Nexstar to acquire television stations without regard to any interests of its officers, directors or attributable shareholders in same-market radio stations or newspapers, (c) permit Nexstar’s existing JSAs with independently-owned television stations to remain in effect indefinitely, and (d) could enable Nexstar to enter into new JSAs without violating FCC regulations.  The Reconsideration Order remains subject to appeals before the Third Circuit.
 In December 2018, the FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review with the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  Among other things, the FCC seeks comment on all aspects of the local television ownership rule’s implementation and whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest.  Comments and reply comments in the 2018 quadrennial review are due in the first and second quarters of 2019.
 Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA, although the FCC will consider showings that this “top four” prohibition should not apply in a given case. The duopoly rule also allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station, where otherwise prohibited, where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt. The FCC reconfirmed that the duopoly rule continues to serve the public interest in the 2016 Ownership Order, which generally retained the rule in the form in which it had existed since 1999.  In its Reconsideration Order, however, the FCC modified the duopoly rule to (1) eliminate the “eight voices” test (whereby the rule had previously required, in addition to the “top four” prohibition, that at least eight independently owned television stations remain in a market after a proposed combination) and (2) permit case-by-case review of proposed “top four” combinations (while generally retaining the “top four” prohibition).  These modifications took effect on February 7, 2018.  The modifications could allow Nexstar to acquire a second television station in certain markets where ownership of two television stations was not previously permitted.  The November 2017 reconsideration order remains subject to federal court appeals.
 The FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a TBA or LMA, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. 
 In its 2016 Ownership Order, the FCC reinstated a rule that attributed another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station’s weekly advertising inventory under a JSA (this rule had been previously adopted but was vacated by the Third Circuit).  Parties to JSAs entered into prior to March 31, 2014 were permitted to continue to operate under these JSAs until September 30, 2025.  However, in the Reconsideration Order, the FCC eliminated the JSA attribution rule in its entirety.  This elimination took effect on February 7, 2018.  As a result of this rule elimination, Nexstar’s existing JSAs with independently-owned television stations may remain in effect indefinitely, and Nexstar may enter into new JSAs without violating FCC regulations.  The November 2017 reconsideration order remains subject to federal court appeals. 
 In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC’s duopoly rule and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations. 

17

In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to waivers under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station.  Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is “failing.” 
 In all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements, except for five, we provide programming comprising less than 15% of the second station’s programming. In the five markets where we provide more programming to the second station—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island—the LMAs were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise.
 With respect to our other local service agreements, a previous FCC rule made a majority of our JSAs attributable, but this rule was eliminated effective February 7, 2018.  As a result, our existing JSAs are no longer attributable and may remain in effect indefinitely.  Under rules in effect both prior to and after February 7, 2018, our SSAs with independently owned same-market stations are non-attributable.  We may therefore retain our existing SSAs in effect indefinitely, but we must disclose them, and the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements. 
 National Television Ownership. There is no limit on the number of television stations which a party may own. However, the FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39%. This rule originally provided that when calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of an ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) station would be counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience.  In August 2016, the FCC adopted an order eliminating this “UHF discount.”  On reconsideration, however, the FCC reinstated the discount, which took effect once again in June 2017.  A petition for review of the FCC’s order reinstating the UHF discount remains pending in a federal appeals court, and Nexstar has intervened in the litigation in support of the FCC.  In December 2017, the FCC initiated a proceeding to broadly reexamine its national television ownership rule, including the percentage reach cap and the UHF discount.  Comments and reply comments in this proceeding were filed in the first and second quarters of 2018. 
 The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of 38.8% of television households without the UHF discount. 
 Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (One-to-a-Market Rule). An FCC rule formerly limited the extent to which a party could hold attributable interests in both television stations and radio stations in the same market. In its November 2017 Reconsideration Order, however, the FCC eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule in its entirety. This elimination took effect on February 7, 2018. The Reconsideration Order remains subject to federal court appeals.  
 Local Television/Newspaper Cross-Ownership Rule. An FCC rule formerly prohibited a party from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper in the same market.  In its November 2017 Reconsideration Order, however, the FCC eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule in its entirety. This elimination took effect on February 7, 2018. The Reconsideration Order remains subject to federal court appeals.
 
Local Television/Cable Cross-Ownership. There is no FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area. 
 
MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.” Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2020 and will be effective January 1, 2021. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.
 
A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.

MVPD operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances.
 
In March 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned.  On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Under this rule and the subsequent legislation, same-market stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned station in the same DMA; or (2) if not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs.  Concurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which seeks additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules.  Comments and reply comments on the further notice were filed in 2014.
 
In addition, in the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was adopted and signed into law in December 2014, the U.S. Congress directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to “review its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.”  The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were filed in 2015 and 2016.  In July 2016, the then-Chairman of the FCC publicly announced that the agency would not adopt additional rules in this proceeding. However, the proceeding remains open.
 
The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals. 
 
Certain online video distributors and other OTTDs have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet.  In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OTTD’s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the “Copyright Act”).  In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term “MVPD” to encompass OTTDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OTTDs.  Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015. Although the FCC has not classified OTTDs as MVPDs to date, several OTTDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements.
 
The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations’ signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements, will negotiate agreements with OTTDs.  
 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a total of 8,959 employees, comprised of 8,249 full-time and 710 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2018, 632 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
 On March 16, 2018, a group of companies including Nexstar (the “Defendants”) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ regarding an investigation into the exchange of certain information related to the pacing of sales related to the same period in the prior year among broadcast stations in some DMAs in alleged violation of federal antitrust law. Other Defendants entered into a proposed consent decree with the DOJ on November 6, 2018. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Nexstar agreed to settle the matter with the DOJ on December 5, 2018.  The DOJ filed an amended complaint adding Nexstar to the consent decree on December 13, 2018.  The consent decree, which settles any claims by the government of alleged violations of federal antitrust laws in connection with the alleged information sharing, does not include any financial penalty. Pursuant to the consent decree, we have agreed not to exchange certain non-public information with other stations operating in the same DMA except in certain cases, to implement certain antitrust compliance measures and to monitor and report on compliance with the consent decree.
 On July 30, 2018, Clay, Massey & Associates, PC filed an antitrust class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on behalf of itself and all others similarly situated against Gray Television, Inc., Hearst Communications, Nexstar Media Group, Inc., Tegna Inc., Tribune Media Company and Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. The lawsuit alleges unlawful coordination between broadcast television station owners to artificially increase prices of television spot advertisements in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. §1). Nexstar has since been named in 15 similar complaints, including ten in the Northern District of Illinois, three in the Southern District of New York, and two in the District of Maryland.  Each complaint includes similar allegations and claims a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  One, filed in the District of Maryland, also alleges violations of state antitrust and consumer protection statutes and a claim for unjust enrichment.
 On October 9, 2018, these cases were consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois captioned In Re: Local TV Advertising Antitrust Litigation, No. 1:18-cv-06785 (“MDL Litigation”).  On January 23, 2019, the Court in the MDL Litigation appointed plaintiffs’ lead and liaison counsel.  The MDL Litigation is ongoing.  Nexstar denies the allegations against it and will defend its advertising practices as necessary.
