At December 31, 2018, the aggregate amount of such loans was $67,279, of which $64,370 was payable to related parties. These loans are non-interest bearing and are due on demand.

This funding has been utilized to fund the general and administrative expenses of the Company (primarily associated with being a US reporting company) and provide working capital.

AllyMe Group, Inc. Shareholders Equity Capital Formation. 
 
The Company was formed on August 13, 2014, with no capital. Thereafter, on November 5, 2015, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of founder’s capital to Gulmira Makhutova at $0.001 per share for an aggregate of $6,000. In the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company issued an additional 2,620,000 shares of its common stock to 29 shareholders at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,200.
 
On July 17, 2018 Zilin Wang purchased 8,618,000 shares of Company Common Stock from Yonghua Kang (as representative of the seller). The shares purchased in this transaction represented 99.98% of the then issued and outstanding shares of the Company.

Following December 31, 2019, the Company believes that it will require additional funding for ongoing operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional capital and have no current arrangements for any such financing.
 
Risks and Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
The Company has had only limited revenues which have been derived from its consulting agreements. Notwithstanding, the Company expects to generate revenues from both the advisory agreements and its initial retail marijuana outlet.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers or build its retail marijuana outlet to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
Due to these and other factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Competition 
 
The Company encounters substantial competition from a wide variety of entities in both of its business lines, most of which is from companies which are better capitalized than the Company. Many of these entities will have significantly greater experience, resources and managerial capabilities than the Company and will therefore be in a better position than the Company to obtain access to attractive business opportunities.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had no employees and had no employees in its Chinese subsidiary.
