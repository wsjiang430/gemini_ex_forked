     ITEM 1.BUSINESS.
     The Kroger Co. (the “Company” or “Kroger”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902.  As of February 2, 2019, we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales.  We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets.  We maintain a web site (www.thekrogerco.com) that includes additional information about the Company.  We make available through our web site, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments.  These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the SEC.
     Our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers.  Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses.  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.  All references to 2018, 2017 and 2016 are to the fiscal years ended February 2, 2019, February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, respectively, unless specifically indicated otherwise.
     EMPLOYEES
     As of February 2, 2019, Kroger employed approximately 453,000 full- and part-time employees. A majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are approximately 360 such agreements, usually with terms of three to five years.     STORES
     As of February 2, 2019, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,764 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names, of which 2,270 had pharmacies and 1,537 had fuel centers.  We offer Pickup (also referred to as ClickList®) and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™— personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 1,581 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to 91% of Kroger households.  Approximately 54% of our supermarkets were operated in Company-owned facilities, including some Company-owned buildings on leased land.  Our current strategy emphasizes self-development and ownership of real estate.  Our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition.  Supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats: combination food and drug stores (“combo stores”); multi-department stores; marketplace stores; or price impact warehouses.
     The combo store is the primary food store format.  They typically draw customers from a 2 — 2.5 mile radius.  We believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one-stop shopping, including natural food and organic sections, pharmacies, general merchandise, pet centers and high-quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce.

 Multi-department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores.  In addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store, multi-department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel, home fashion and furnishings, outdoor living, electronics, automotive products and toys.
     Marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi-department stores.  They offer full-service grocery, pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel, home goods and toys.
     Price impact warehouse stores offer a “no-frills, low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items. Quality meat, dairy, baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage. The average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of  a combo store.
     SEGMENTS
    
We operate supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States.  Our retail operations, which represent 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment.  We aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long-term financial performance.  In addition, our operating divisions offer customers similar products,  have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments, purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar (and in many cases identical) vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location, serve similar types of customers, and are allocated capital from a centralized location.  Our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division. This geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions.  The geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our Chief Executive Officer, who acts as our chief operating decision maker, assesses performance internally.  All of our operations are domestic.  Revenues, profits and losses and total assets are shown in our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 below.     MERCHANDISING AND MANUFACTURING
     Our Brands products play an important role in our merchandising strategy. Our supermarkets, on average, stock over 15,000 private label items. Our Brands products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers.” Private Selection® is one of our premium quality brands, offering customers culinary foods and ingredients that deliver amazing eating experiences. The Kroger® brand, which represents the majority of our private label items, is designed to consistently satisfy and delight customers with quality products that exceed or meet the national brand in taste and efficacy, as well as with unique and differentiated products. Big K®, Check This Out…® and Heritage Farm® are some of our value brands, designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price. In addition, we continue to grow natural and organic Our Brands offerings with Simple Truth® and Simple Truth Organic®. Both Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic are free from a defined list of artificial ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food, and the Simple Truth Organic products are USDA certified organic.
     Approximately 32% of Our Brands units and 43% of the grocery category Our Brands units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants; the remaining Our Brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers.  We perform a “make or buy” analysis on Our Brands products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market-based transfer prices versus open market purchases.  As of February 2, 2019, we operated 37 food production plants. These plants consisted of 17 dairies, 10 deli or bakery plants, five grocery product plants, two beverage plants, one meat plant and two cheese plants.
     SEASONALITY
     The majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature.  However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year.  Additionally, significant inclement weather systems, particularly winter storms, tend to affect our sales trends.
