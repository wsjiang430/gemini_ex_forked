 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 We offer scheduled passenger service with approximately 2,770 daily departures to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean. Substantially all of our flights are operated as Delta Connection, United Express, American Eagle or Alaska Airlines flights under code‑share arrangements (commercial agreements between airlines that, among other things, allow one airline to use another airline’s flight designator codes on its flights) with Delta, United, American or Alaska, respectively. We generally provide regional flying to our major airline partners under long‑term, fixed‑fee, code‑share agreements. Under these fixed‑fee agreements, our major airline partners generally pay us fixed rates for operating the aircraft primarily based on the number of completed flights, flight time and the number of aircraft under contract. The major airline partners also reimburse us for specified direct operating expenses (including fuel expense).

 *As of December 31, 2018, these aircraft have been removed from service and are in the process of being returned under the applicable leasing arrangement or are aircraft transitioning between code-share agreements with our major airline partners. 
     As of December 31, 2018, our fleet scheduled for service consisted of aircraft manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace (“Bombardier”) and Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”) summarized as follows:

Manufacturer | Aircraft Type | Seat Configuration
Bombardier | CRJ900s | 76 
Bombardier | CRJ700s | 65-70 
Bombardier | CRJ200s | 50 
Embraer | E175s | 76 
Embraer | ERJ145s | 50 

      Bombardier and Embraer are the primary manufacturers of regional jets operated in the United States and offer many of the amenities of larger commercial jet aircraft, including flight attendant service, a stand‑up cabin, overhead and under seat storage, lavatories and in‑flight snack and beverage service. The speed of Bombardier and Embraer regional jets is comparable to larger aircraft operated by major airlines, and they have a range of approximately 1,600 miles and 2,100 miles, respectively.
 We were incorporated in Utah in 1972. Our principal executive offices are located at 444 South River Road, St. George, Utah 84790, and our primary telephone number is (435) 634‑3000. We maintain an internet website at inc.skywest.com, which provides links to our annual, quarterly and current reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information on our website does not constitute part of this Report. In addition, we provide electronic or paper copies of our SEC filings free of charge upon request.

  A summary of the terms for each of our code‑share agreements is provided under the heading “Code-Share Agreements” below on page 6.
 ExpressJet
 Prior to our sale of ExpressJet in January 2019, ExpressJet provided regional jet service to airports primarily located in the Eastern and Midwestern United States, as well as Mexico, Canada and the Caribbean.  ExpressJet’s operations were conducted principally from airports located in Atlanta, Chicago (O’Hare), Houston, Newark and New York. During the year ended December 31, 2018, ExpressJet offered approximately 600 daily departures, of which approximately 90 were Delta Connection flights, 440 were United Express flights and 70 were American Eagle flights. As of December 31, 2018, ExpressJet operated a fleet of 126 aircraft consisting of the following:

 | CRJ200 | ERJ145 | CRJ700 | Total
United | 16 | 100 | — | 116 
American | — | — | 10 | 10 
Total | 16 | 100 | 10 | 126 


 SkyWest Leasing
 The SkyWest Leasing segment includes revenue attributed to our Embraer E175 dual-class regional jet aircraft (“E175”) ownership cost earned under the applicable fixed-fee contracts, and the depreciation and interest expense of our E175 aircraft.  The SkyWest Leasing segment’s total assets and capital expenditures include the acquired E175 aircraft.  The SkyWest Leasing segment additionally includes the income from CRJ200 aircraft leased to a third-party.
 Competition and Economic Conditions
 The airline industry is highly competitive. SkyWest competes principally with other regional airlines. Our operations extend throughout most major geographic markets in the United States. Our competition includes, therefore, nearly every other domestic regional airline. Our primary competitors include Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (“Air Wisconsin”); Endeavor Air, Inc. (“Endeavor”) (owned by Delta); Envoy Air Inc. (“Envoy”), PSA Airlines, Inc. (“PSA”) and Piedmont Airlines (“Piedmont”) (Envoy, PSA and Piedmont are owned by American); ExpressJet Airlines (subsequent to January 2019); Horizon Air Industries, Inc. (“Horizon”) (owned by Alaska Air Group, Inc.); Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa”); Republic Airways Holdings Inc. (“Republic”); and Trans States Airlines, Inc. (“Trans States”). Major airlines typically award code-share flying arrangements to regional airlines based primarily upon the following criteria: ability to fly contracted schedules, availability of labor resources, including pilots, low operating cost, financial 

 
  5

 
resources, geographical infrastructure, overall customer service levels relating to on‑time arrival and flight completion percentages and the overall image of the regional airline.
 The principal competitive factors for regional airline code‑share arrangements include labor resources, code‑share agreement terms, reliable flight operations, operating cost structure, ability to finance new aircraft, certification to operate certain aircraft types and geographical infrastructure and markets and routes served. 
 Our operations represent the largest regional airline operations in the United States. However, regional carriers owned by major airlines may have access to greater resources than we do through their parent companies.
 Generally, the airline industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Economic downturns, combined with competitive pressures, have contributed to a number of reorganizations, bankruptcies, liquidations and business combinations among major and regional carriers. The effect of economic downturns may be somewhat mitigated by our predominantly contract-based flying arrangements. If, however, any of our major airline partners experience a prolonged decline in the number of passengers or are negatively affected by low ticket prices or high fuel prices, they may seek rate reductions in future code-share agreements, or materially reduce scheduled flights in order to reduce their costs. In addition, adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to complete scheduled flights and can have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.     Industry Overview
 Majors, Low-Cost Carriers and Regional Airlines
 The airline industry in the United States has traditionally been comprised of several major airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta and United. The major airlines offer scheduled flights to most major U.S. cities, numerous smaller U.S. cities, and cities throughout the world through a hub and spoke network.
 Low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines Co. (“Southwest”) and JetBlue Airways Corporation (“JetBlue”), generally offer fewer conveniences to travelers and have lower cost structures than major airlines, which permits them to offer flights to and from many of the same markets as the major airlines, but at lower prices. 
 Regional airlines, including SkyWest, typically operate smaller aircraft on shorter distance routes than major and low‑cost carriers. Several regional airlines, including Endeavor, Envoy, Horizon, Piedmont and PSA, are wholly‑owned subsidiaries of major airlines.
 Regional airlines generally do not try to establish an independent route system to compete with the major airlines. Rather, regional airlines typically enter into relationships with one or more major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline agrees to use its smaller, lower‑cost aircraft to carry passengers booked and ticketed by the major airline between a hub of the major airline and a smaller outlying city. In exchange for such services, the major airline pays the regional airline either a fixed flight fee, termed “contract” or “fixed‑fee” flights, or the regional airline receives a percentage of applicable passenger ticket revenues, termed “prorate” or “revenue‑sharing” flights, as described in more detail below.
 Code‑Share Agreements
 Regional airlines generally enter into code‑share agreements with major airlines, pursuant to which the regional airline is authorized to use the major airline’s two‑letter flight designator codes to identify the regional airline’s flights and fares in the central reservation systems, to paint its aircraft with the colors and/or logos of the major airline and to market and advertise its status as a carrier for the major airline. Code‑share agreements also generally obligate the major airline to provide services such as reservations, ticketing, ground support and gate access to the regional airline, and the major airline often coordinates marketing, advertising and other promotional efforts. In exchange, the regional airline provides a designated number of low‑capacity (usually between 50 and 76 seats) flights between larger airports served by the major airline and surrounding cities, usually in lower‑volume markets. The financial arrangements between the regional airlines and their code‑share partners usually involve either fixed‑fee arrangements or revenue‑sharing arrangements as explained below:

· | Fixed‑Fee Arrangements. Under a fixed‑fee arrangement (referred to as a “fixed‑fee arrangement,” “fixed-fee contract,” “contract flying” or a “capacity purchase agreement”), the major airline generally pays the 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
  6

 

regional airline a fixed‑fee for each departure, flight hour (measured from takeoff to landing, excluding taxi time) and block hour (measured from takeoff to landing, including taxi time) incurred, and an amount per aircraft in service each month with additional incentives based on completion of flights, on‑time performance and other operating metrics. The regional airline typically acquires or finances the aircraft used under the fixed-fee arrangement, which is considered a lease of the aircraft to our major airline partner. In addition, under a fixed fee arrangement, the major airline bears the risk of fuel price fluctuations and certain other costs. Regional airlines benefit from fixed‑fee arrangements because they are protected from some of the elements that cause volatility in airline financial performance, including variations in ticket prices, number of passengers and fuel prices. However, regional airlines in fixed‑fee arrangements generally do not benefit from positive trends in ticket prices, ancillary revenue, such as baggage and food and beverage fees, the number of passengers enplaned or fuel prices, because the major airlines retain passenger fare volatility risk and fuel costs associated with the regional airline flight.

· | Revenue‑Sharing Arrangements. Under a revenue‑sharing arrangement (referred to as a “revenue‑sharing” arrangement or “prorate” arrangement), the major airline and regional airline negotiate a passenger fare proration formula for specifically identified routes, pursuant to which the regional airline receives a percentage of the ticket revenues for those passengers traveling for one portion of their trip on the regional airline and the other portion of their trip on the major airline. On the other hand, the regional airline receives all of the passenger fare when a passenger purchases a ticket on a route solely operated by the regional airline. Substantially all costs associated with the regional airline flight are borne by the regional airline. In a revenue‑sharing arrangement, the regional airline may realize increased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads increase or fuel prices decrease and, correspondingly, the regional airline may realize decreased profits as ticket prices and passenger loads decrease or fuel prices increase.

  We have code‑share agreements with United, Delta, American and Alaska. ExpressJet had code‑share agreements with United, Delta and American during 2018.
 During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 84.3% of our and ExpressJet’s flying agreements revenue related to fixed‑fee contract flights, where Delta, United, American and Alaska controlled scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. The remainder of our flying agreements revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 related to prorate flights for Delta, United or American, where we controlled scheduling, pricing and seat inventories, and shared passenger fares with Delta, United or American according to prorate formulas. 
 Under our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners compensate us for our costs of owning or leasing the aircraft on a monthly basis. The aircraft compensation structure varies by agreement, but is intended to cover either our aircraft principal and interest debt service costs, our aircraft depreciation and interest expense or our aircraft lease expense costs while the aircraft is under contract. The number of aircraft under our fixed‑fee arrangements and our prorate arrangements as of December 31, 2018 is reflected in the summary below. The following summaries of our code-share agreements with our major airline partners do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreement.

      As of December 31, 2018, ExpressJet operated 100 ERJ145 aircraft and 16 CRJ200 aircraft under fixed-fee agreements with United and 10 CRJ700 aircraft under a fixed-fee agreement with American.  We sold ExpressJet in January 2019.  In conjunction with the sale of ExpressJet, SkyWest retained ownership of the 16 CRJ200 aircraft and the 10 CRJ700 aircraft operated by ExpressJet as of December 31, 2018. We agreed to lease the 16 CRJ200 aircraft to ExpressJet for up to a five-year period.  We are pursuing alternative uses of the 10 CRJ700 aircraft, including but not limited to, using the aircraft under fixed-fee agreements or leasing the aircraft or related engines to third parties.  ExpressJet leased 100 ERJ145 from United and the ERJ145 aircraft remained with ExpressJet in conjunction with the sale of ExpressJet.
 In addition to the contractual arrangements described above, we have entered into agreements with Alaska and Delta to acquire and operate additional E175 dual-class regional jet aircraft (which are typically configured with 76 or 70 seats) for those major airline partners.  As of December 31, 2018, we anticipated placing an additional three E175 aircraft with Alaska and nine E175 aircraft with Delta. The delivery dates for the new E175 aircraft are expected to take place from 2019 through 2021. Final delivery dates may be adjusted based on various factors. 
 We also entered into an agreement with Delta to operate 20 new Canadair CRJ900 regional jet aircraft (“CRJ900”). The aircraft will be acquired by Delta and operated by us under a fixed-fee agreement.  As of December 31, 2018, we had taken delivery of five of these CRJ900 aircraft and placed them into service, and anticipate the delivery of the remaining 15 aircraft will continue through the end of 2020. These aircraft will replace 20 CRJ700 aircraft scheduled to expire under our flying contracts with Delta. 
 Delta Connection Agreements

We and Delta are parties to a Delta Connection Agreement (the "Delta Connection Agreement"), pursuant to which we provide contract flight services for Delta.

  Training and Aircraft Maintenance
 SkyWest provides substantially all training to our crew members and maintenance personnel at our training facilities. Our employees perform routine airframe and engine maintenance along with periodic inspections of equipment at our maintenance facilities. We also use third‑party vendors for certain airframe and engine maintenance work. Fuel
 Our fixed‑fee agreements with Delta, United, American and Alaska require the respective major airline partner to reimburse us for the fuel costs we incur under those agreements, thereby reducing our exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Under our prorate agreements with Delta, United and American, we are responsible for the costs to operate the flights, including fuel costs, and therefore we are exposed to fuel price fluctuations for flights operated under our prorate agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, United and Delta purchased the majority of the fuel for our aircraft flying under their respective fixed-fee agreements directly from their fuel vendors. Historically, we have not experienced problems with the availability of fuel, and believe we will be able to obtain fuel in quantities sufficient to meet our existing and anticipated future requirements at competitive prices. Standard industry fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide protection against fuel price increases, nor do they ensure availability of supply. We typically purchase fuel from third-party suppliers for our prorate agreements. A substantial increase in the price of jet fuel for flights we operate under our prorate agreements, or the lack of adequate fuel supplies in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Employee Matters
 Collective Bargaining
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,900 full‑time equivalent employees, including 2,932 employed by ExpressJet. Approximately 85.3% of these employees were represented by a labor group. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 2,320 of ExpressJet’s 2,932 employees were represented by a national union. 
 As of December 31, 2018, SkyWest and SkyWest Airlines collectively employed 12,968 full‑time equivalent employees, consisting of 4,706 pilots, 3,843 flight attendants, 1,633 customer service personnel, 1,208 mechanics, 893 other maintenance personnel, 190 dispatchers and 495 operational support and administrative personnel. None of these employees are currently represented by a national union. Our employees are represented by in-house labor associations 

 
  10

 
that have entered into collective bargaining agreements regarding our employee compensation and work rules.  Union organizing efforts among our employees do occur from time to time and may continue in the future. If unionization efforts are successful, we may be subjected to increased risks of work interruption or stoppage and/or incur additional expenses associated with increased union representation of our employees. Neither SkyWest nor SkyWest Airlines has ever experienced a work stoppage due to a strike or other labor dispute, and we consider our relationships with our employees to be good.
 Our relations with labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act (the “RLA”). Under the RLA, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor representative does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. If either party wishes to modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed by the RLA and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of such notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and if no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board to initiate a process including mediation, arbitration, and a potential “cooling off” period that must be followed before either party may engage in “self-help.” “Self-help” includes, among other things, a strike by the representative or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. The U.S. Congress and the President have the authority to prevent “self-help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.
 Government Regulation
 All interstate air carriers, including SkyWest, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may engage in flight, maintenance or operating activities; record‑keeping procedures in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and retraining programs. Generally, governmental agencies enforce their regulations through, among other methods, certifications, which are necessary for the continued operations of SkyWest, and proceedings, which can result in civil or criminal penalties or revocation of operating authority. The FAA can also issue maintenance directives and other mandatory orders relating to, among other things, grounding of aircraft, inspection of aircraft, installation of new safety‑related items and the mandatory removal and replacement of aircraft parts.
 We believe SkyWest is in compliance in all material respects with FAA regulations and holds all operating and airworthiness certificates and licenses which are necessary to conduct our operations. We incur substantial costs in maintaining current certifications and otherwise complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. Our flight operations, maintenance programs, record keeping and training programs are conducted under FAA approved procedures. All air carriers operating in the United States are required to comply with federal laws and regulations pertaining to noise abatement and engine emissions. All such air carriers are also subject to certain provisions of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended, because of their extensive use of radio and other communication facilities. SkyWest is also subject to certain federal and state laws relating to protection of the environment, labor relations and equal employment opportunity. We believe SkyWest is in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations.
 Environmental Matters
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection matters. These laws and regulations govern such matters as environmental reporting, storage and disposal of materials and chemicals and aircraft noise. We are, and expect in the future to be, involved in various environmental matters and conditions at, or related to, our properties. We are not currently subject to any environmental cleanup orders or actions imposed by regulatory authorities. We are not aware of any active material environmental investigations related to our assets or properties.

 Safety and Security
 We are committed to the safety and security of our passengers and employees. We have taken many steps, both voluntarily and as mandated by governmental authorities, to increase the safety and security of our operations. Some of the safety and security measures we have taken with our major airline partners include: aircraft security and surveillance, positive bag matching procedures, enhanced passenger and baggage screening and search procedures, and securing of cockpit doors. We are committed to complying with future safety and security requirements. Insurance
 We maintain insurance policies we believe are of types customary in the industry and in amounts we believe are adequate to protect against material loss. These policies principally provide coverage for public liability, passenger liability, baggage and cargo liability, property damage, including coverage for loss or damage to our flight equipment, and workers’ compensation insurance.  Seasonality
 Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year, in part because the airline industry is subject to seasonal fluctuations and changes in general economic conditions. Our operations are somewhat favorably affected by pleasure travel on our prorate routes, historically contributing to increased travel in the summer months, and are unfavorably affected by decreased business travel during the months from November through January and by inclement weather which can result in cancelled flights, principally during the winter months. Additionally, a significant portion of our fixed‑fee arrangements is based on completing flights and we typically have more scheduled flights during the summer months. We generally experience a significantly higher number of weather cancellations during the winter months, which negatively impacts our revenue during such months.
