ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Company Overview
 We are a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company that is focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for hematologic myeloid malignancies. We have global rights to imetelstat, a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, that was discovered and developed at Geron. We believe clinical data from two Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat (IMerge and IMbark, discussed below) conducted by Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen, support further development of imetelstat in hematologic myeloid malignancies. We are working with Janssen to transition the imetelstat program to us. See further discussion below regarding our past and current relationship with Janssen.
 We plan to open patient screening and enrollment by mid-year of 2019 in a Phase 3 clinical trial (Part 2 of IMerge) to evaluate imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with Low or Intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent, or ESA, have not received prior treatment with either a hypomethylating agent or lenalidomide and do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality. This target population of lower risk MDS patients depend on serial red blood cell transfusions to manage symptoms of anemia and fatigue. However, dependency on transfusions is associated with poor survival, because of toxicity due to iron overload, as well as potential infections and allergic reactions. The ultimate goal for most trials of investigational agents in lower risk MDS is to enable patients to become transfusion independent for as long as possible. In December 2018, we reported results from the Phase 2 portion of IMerge in which 37% of patients experienced red blood cell transfusion independence for at least 8 consecutive weeks, or an 8-week RBC-TI, rate
. Importantly, this 8-week RBC-TI rate was observed in patients with high transfusion burdens, an indicator of a more difficult to treat population. Patients enrolled into the Phase 2 portion of IMerge had a baseline median red blood cell transfusion burden of eight units per eight weeks with a range of four to 14 units. Our results compare favorably to currently used treatments in a similar patient population, such as hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, which have a reported 8-week RBC-TI rate of 17%, or lenalidomide, which has a reported 8-week RBC-TI rate of 27%. In addition, among the patients in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge who achieved a durable response, as reflected by achieving a 24-week RBC-TI, all showed a hemoglobin rise of ≥3.0 g/dL compared to baseline during the transfusion-free interval. We believe these data suggest potential disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment.
 Regarding our myelofibrosis, or MF, program, we reported data in December 2018 from the IMbark Phase 2 clinical trial, including the median overall survival of 29.9 months observed in the trial in comparison to the median overall survival of 14 – 16 months for patients previously treated with janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitors. We plan to discuss the IMbark data with experts in MF, as well as regulatory authorities, to consider how these results compare with other therapies currently available to MF patients, and to gain a better understanding of the potential significance of these results to patients and physicians. Because IMbark is the first clinical trial to apply rigorous, objective eligibility criteria to define patients considered relapsed or refractory to JAK inhibitors, we believe feedback from these discussions could provide important information on the feasibility, scope and design, including possible outcome measures, of any potential future clinical trials for imetelstat in Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. We expect to outline our decision whether to continue late-stage development of imetelstat in MF by the end of the third quarter of 2019. This decision will be influenced by our assessment of what would be required to achieve clinical and regulatory success in MF, including the cost and duration of any potential clinical trials.
 We had approximately $182.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and current and noncurrent marketable securities as of December 31, 2018, which is sufficient to commence the planned Phase 3 portion IMerge. If approved for marketing by regulatory authorities, we plan to commercialize imetelstat in the United States ourselves and seek potential commercialization partners for territories outside of the United States.

Telomerase: Scientific Rationale
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Normal Development
 In the human body, normal growth and maintenance of tissues occurs by cell division. However, most cells are only able to divide a limited number of times, and this number of divisions is regulated by telomere length. Telomeres are repetitions of a deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence located at the ends of chromosomes. They act as protective caps to maintain stability and integrity of the chromosomes, which contain the cell’s genetic material. Normally, every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, they shrink to a critically short length, and as a result, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces.
 Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division, such as stem cells that must remain immortalized to support normal health. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: a ribonucleic acid, or RNA, template (hTR), which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic subunit (hTERT) with reverse transcriptase activity, which adds a specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends. The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Drs. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack Szostak, former Geron collaborators, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by both telomeres and telomerase.
 Telomerase is active during embryonic development, enabling the rapid cell division that supports normal growth. During the latter stages of human fetal development and in adulthood, telomerase is repressed in most cells, and telomere length gradually decreases during a lifetime. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to enable controlled, self‑limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural cell aging processes. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation.
 Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer
 Telomerase is upregulated in many tumor progenitor cells, enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells that drive tumor growth and progression. Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Our nonclinical studies, in which the telomerase gene was artificially introduced and expressed in normal cells grown in culture, have suggested that telomerase does not itself cause a normal cell to become malignant. Instead, the sustained upregulation of telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, providing them with the capacity for limitless proliferation. We believe that the sustained upregulation of telomerase is critical for tumor progression as it enables malignant progenitor cells to acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, or cell death.
 Telomerase Inhibition: Inducing Cancer Cell Death
 We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells. We and others have observed in various in vitro and rodent tumor models that inhibiting telomerase results in telomere shortening and arrests uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In vitro studies have suggested that tumor cells with short telomeres may be especially sensitive to the anti‑proliferative effects of inhibiting telomerase. Our nonclinical data also suggest that inhibiting telomerase is particularly effective at limiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells, which have high levels of telomerase and are believed to be important drivers of tumor growth and progression.
Imetelstat: The First Telomerase Inhibitor to Advance to Clinical Development
 Imetelstat is a lipid conjugated 13‑mer oligonucleotide that we designed to be complementary to and bind with high affinity to the RNA template of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity. Imetelstat does not elicit its effect through an antisense inhibition of protein translation. The compound has a proprietary thio‑phosphoramidate backbone, which is designed to provide resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as well as improved binding affinity to its target. To improve the ability of imetelstat to penetrate cellular membranes, we conjugated the oligonucleotide to a lipid group. Imetelstat’s IC50, or half maximal inhibitory concentration, is 0.5 – 10 nM in cell free assays. Single‑dose kinetics in patients has shown dose‑dependent increases in exposure to imetelstat, with a plasma half‑life, which is the time it takes for the 
 5


concentration or amount of imetelstat to be reduced by half, ranging from 4 – 5 hours. Data from animal studies and clinical trials have suggested that the residence time of imetelstat in bone marrow is long, with 0.19 – 0.51 µM observed at 41 – 45 hours after a 7.5 mg/kg dose in patients. Imetelstat also has been shown in nonclinical studies to exhibit relatively preferential inhibition of the clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells compared to normal progenitors. For these reasons, imetelstat has been studied as a potential treatment for malignant diseases.
 Imetelstat is the first telomerase inhibitor to advance to clinical development. The Phase 1 trials that we completed evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of imetelstat. We established doses and dosing schedules that were tolerable and achieved target exposures in patients that were consistent with those required for efficacy in animal models. Following intravenous administration of imetelstat using tolerable dosing regimens, clinically relevant and significant inhibition of telomerase activity was observed in various types of tissue in which telomerase activity is measurable, including normal bone marrow hematopoietic cells, malignant plasma cells, hair follicle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dose‑limiting toxicities included thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet count, and neutropenia, or reduced neutrophil count.
 Disease Characteristics of Hematologic Malignancies
 Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, are classified according to the predominant location of the malignancy. A hematologic myeloid malignancy is a cancer that occurs in the precursor cells to red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, such as granulocytes. Examples include acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, MDS and the myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as essential thrombocythemia, or ET, polycythemia vera and MF. These are different from lymphocytic malignancies which typically occur in the lymphoid lineage that includes white blood cells, such as T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. Examples of lymphoid malignancies include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and multiple myeloma.
 Many hematologic myeloid malignancies, such as ET, MF, and MDS, have been shown to arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow that express higher telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells.
 Unmet Medical Need in Myelodysplastic Syndromes
 MDS is a group of blood disorders in which the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones in the bone marrow results in disordered and ineffective production of the myeloid lineage, which includes red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In MDS, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells may have abnormal, or dysplastic, cell morphology. MDS is frequently characterized clinically by severe anemia, or low red blood cell counts, and low hemoglobin. In addition, other peripheral cytopenias, or low numbers of white blood cells and platelets, may cause life‑threatening infections and bleeding. Transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, occurs in up to 30% of MDS cases and results in poorer overall survival.
 MDS is the most common of the myeloid malignancies. There are approximately 60,000 people in the United States living with the disease and approximately 16,000 reported new cases of MDS in the United States every year. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with median age at diagnosis around 70 years. The majority of patients, approximately 70%, fall into what are considered to be the lower risk groups at diagnosis, according to the International Prognostic Scoring System, or IPSS, that takes into account the presence of a number of disease factors, such as cytopenias and cytogenetics, to assign relative risk of progression to AML and overall survival.
 Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem in patients who have lower risk MDS. Many of these patients become dependent on red blood cell transfusions due to low hemoglobin. Serial red blood cell transfusions can lead to elevated levels of iron in the blood and other tissues, which the body has no normal way to eliminate. Iron overload is a potentially dangerous condition. Studies in patients with MDS have shown that iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions is associated with a poorer overall survival and a higher risk of developing AML.

There have been no new drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for MDS therapy since 2006 and clinicians note that currently available therapies are likely to fail the majority of patients within two to three years after treatment initiation even if there is initial favorable response. Typically, patients with lower risk MDS are treated with ESAs, such as erythropoietin, or EPO. Although ESAs provide an improvement in anemia in approximately 50% of patients, the effect is transient with a median duration of treatment of approximately two years. Once ESAs fail for patients, HMAs and lenalidomide have been used to improve anemia, but with limited success, such as reported 8-week RBC-TI rates of 17% for azacitidine, an HMA, and 27% for lenalidomide. No drug therapy has been shown prospectively to prolong survival in lower risk MDS, nor to delay disease progression.
 Unmet Medical Need in Myelofibrosis
 MF, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, is a chronic blood cancer in which abnormal or malignant precursor cells in the bone marrow proliferate rapidly, causing scar tissue, or fibrosis, to form. As a result, normal blood production in the bone marrow is impaired and may shift to other organs, such as the spleen and liver, which can cause them to enlarge substantially. People with MF may have abnormally low or high numbers of circulating red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets, and abnormally high numbers of immature cells in the blood or bone marrow. MF patients can also suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms, such as drenching night sweats, fatigue, severe itching, or pruritus, abdominal pain, fever and bone pain. The estimated prevalence of MF in the United States, or U.S., is approximately 13,000 patients, with an annual incidence of approximately 3,000 patients. Up to 20% of patients with MF develop AML.
 Approximately 70% of MF patients are classified as having Intermediate‑2 or High-risk disease, as defined by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus, or DIPSS Plus, described in a 2011 Journal of Clinical Oncology article. There is currently only one targeted drug therapy, ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, approved by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for treating these MF patients. Currently, no drug therapy is approved for those patients who fail or no longer respond to that treatment, and median survival for such MF patients is only approximately 14 – 16 months, representing a significant unmet medical need.
Developing Imetelstat to Treat Hematologic Myeloid Malignancies
 Proof‑of‑Concept of Imetelstat’s Disease‑Modifying Potential
 We believe that imetelstat may have the potential to suppress the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones to allow recovery of normal hematopoiesis in patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies. Early clinical data from a Phase 2 trial of imetelstat in patients with ET, or the ET Trial, and a pilot study of imetelstat in patients with MF conducted at Mayo Clinic, or the Pilot Study, suggest imetelstat may exhibit such disease‑modifying activity. These data were published in two separate articles in a September 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. 
 Reported adverse events, or AEs, and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study included cytopenias, gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, and hepatic biochemistry abnormalities. Dose‑limiting toxicities, such as profound and prolonged thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and other safety issues, including death, were observed in the ET Trial and the Pilot Study. In those trials, such myelosuppression was managed by dose holds and modification rules.
 IMerge (Phase 2/3 Trial) in Lower Risk MDS
 Trial Design
 IMerge is a two-part clinical trial evaluating imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with Low or Intermediate-1 risk, also referred to as lower risk, MDS, who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an ESA. Part 1 of IMerge was designed as a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial to assess the efficacy and safety of imetelstat administered as an intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 7.5 mg/kg every four weeks in approximately 30 patients, and originally was conducted by Janssen as part of a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement. See further discussion below regarding our past and current relationship with Janssen. The first patient was dosed in January 2016. To be eligible for the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, patients were required to be 
 7


transfusion dependent, defined as requiring at least four units of packed red blood cells, or RBCs, over an eight week period during the 16 weeks before entry into the trial. 
 The primary efficacy endpoint of IMerge is the rate of RBC transfusion independence, or RBC-TI, lasting at least eight weeks, defined as the proportion of patients without any RBC transfusion during any consecutive eight weeks since entry to the trial, or 8-week RBC-TI rate. Key secondary endpoints include the rate of RBC-TI lasting at least 24 weeks, or 24-week RBC-TI rate, and the rate of hematologic improvement-erythroid, or HI-E, defined as a rise in hemoglobin of at least 1.5 g/dL above the pretreatment level for at least eight weeks or a reduction of at least four units of RBC transfusions over eight weeks compared with the prior RBC transfusion burden. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the time to and duration of RBC-TI; the proportion of patients achieving Complete Response, or CR, or Partial Response, or PR, according to the 2006 International Working Group, or IWG, criteria for MDS; the proportion of patients requiring RBC transfusions and the transfusion burden; the proportion of patients requiring the use of myeloid growth factors and the dose; assessments of the change in the patients’ quality of life using several validated instruments; as well as an assessment of overall survival and time to progression to AML. 
 32 patients were initially enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, of which a cohort of 13 patients had not received prior treatment with either an HMA or lenalidomide and did not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality, also known as non-del(5q). Preliminary data from the Phase 2 portion of IMerge were presented at the European Hematology Association, or EHA, Annual Congress, in June 2018. These data showed that the 13-patient initial cohort exhibited an increased rate and durability of transfusion independence compared to the overall trial population (8-week RBC-TI rate: 54% vs. 34%). The safety profile in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified. The most frequently reported adverse events were cytopenias, which were predictable, manageable and reversible, in most cases, including Grade 3 and 4, or severe, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, reported adverse events did not differ significantly between the overall trial population and the 13-patient initial cohort. 
 Based on the preliminary data from the initial cohort of 13 patients, Janssen expanded new patient enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge and enrolled 25 additional patients, or an expansion cohort, who are non-del(5q) and naïve to HMA and lenalidomide treatment, to increase the clinical experience and confirm the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in this target patient population. In November 2017, the first patient was dosed in the expanded Phase 2 portion of IMerge and enrollment was completed in February 2018.
 Detailed results for the target patient population (n=38) from the combined initial cohort of 13 patients and expansion cohort of 25 patients were recently presented at the 60th American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2018. A summary of the results is below.

ASH Presentation Highlights
 In the ASH presentation, results were reported using a clinical cut-off date of October 26, 2018. For the initial 13-patient cohort, the median follow-up was 29.1 months and for the 25-patient expansion cohort, the median follow-up was 8.7 months. The median number of treatment cycles was 8.0 (range: 1 – 34) and the mean dose intensity was 6.9 mg/kg/cycle. The baseline characteristics of the aggregate 38 patients in the combined cohorts highlight the high transfusion burden of these patients, indicating the significant disease burden of this patient population.

 The 8-week RBC-TI rate for the 38 patients in the combined cohorts was 37% and 26% of patients achieved a durable response with
 24-week RBC-
TI.
 In addition, among the patients achieving durable transfusion independence, all showed a hemoglobin rise of ≥3.0 g/dL compared to baseline during the transfusion-free interval. We believe these data suggest potential disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment. In addition, similar 8-week RBC-TI rates were observed between ringed
 sideroblast positive (37%) patients and other 
patients (36%), and between those patients with baseline erythropoietin levels >500 mU/mL (33%) and ≤500 mU/mL (40%), indicating the broad clinical activity of imetelstat in the Phase 2 portion of this trial. These and other efficacy data are also summarized in the table below:

As summarized in the table below, the safety profile was consistent with prior clinical trials of imetelstat in hematologic malignancies, and no new safety signals were identified. Nineteen patients (50%) had dose reductions and 26 patients (68%) had cycle delays. Reversible Grade 3 liver function test, or LFT, elevations were observed in three patients (8%) and an independent Hepatic Review Committee deemed the observed LFT elevations were not imetelstat-related hepatic toxicities.

 Current Status of the Phase 2 Portion of IMerge
 The Phase 2 portion of IMerge has been officially closed to new patient enrollment and patients remaining in the treatment phase are eligible to continue to receive imetelstat treatment, per investigator discretion. Data collection and patient follow-up continue in accordance with the trial protocol and is being conducted by Janssen during the program transition period. In connection with the transition of the imetelstat program, we expect sponsorship for IMerge to be transferred from Janssen to us by the end of the second quarter of 2019. Once the IND transfer has been completed, we will assume responsibility for treating and following patients in accordance with the Phase 2 trial protocol.
 We expect more mature data from the patients continuing in the treatment phase of the Phase 2 portion of IMerge to be available in 2019 and anticipate submitting such data for presentation at a future medical conference in 2019.

Plan for IMerge Phase 3 Clinical Trial to Begin by Mid-Year 2019
 Based on the results of the Phase 2 portion of IMerge

, we intend to continue the development of imetelstat in lower risk MDS. Importantly, the 37% 8-week RBC-TI rate observed in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge compares favorably to currently used treatments in a similar patient population, such as HMAs, with a reported 8-week RBC-TI rate of 17% or lenalidomide, with a reported 8-week RBC-TI rate of 27%. Also, the IMerge results were observed in patients with high transfusion burdens, an indicator of a more difficult to treat population and among the patients who achieved durable transfusion independence in the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, all showed a hemoglobin rise of ≥3.0 g/dL compared to baseline during the transfusion-free interval. We believe these data suggest potential disease-modifying activity of imetelstat treatment.
 We expect patient screening and enrollment of Part 2, or the Phase 3 portion, of IMerge, to begin by mid-year of 2019, after sponsorship of the ongoing imetelstat clinical trials has been transferred from Janssen to us. The Phase 3 portion of IMerge is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 170 patients, which will evaluate imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS, who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an ESA, have not received prior treatment with either an HMA or lenalidomide and do not have a deletion 5q chromosomal abnormality. We expect the trial to be conducted at multiple medical centers globally, including North America, Europe and Asia. Trial design information for the Phase 3 portion of IMerge, including patient eligibility criteria and locations of clinical sites, will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov. 
 IMbark (Phase 2 Trial) in Relapsed/Refractory MF
 Trial Design
 IMbark was designed as a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate two starting dose levels of imetelstat (either 4.7 mg/kg or 9.4 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks) in approximately 200 patients with Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. We believe IMbark is the first clinical trial to rigorously define this specific patient population, as currently there is no established clinical definition for relapsed after or refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. Patients eligible for the trial were required to have active symptoms of MF, together with worsening of splenomegaly-related abdominal pain at any time after the start of JAK inhibitor therapy, and either: no reduction in spleen volume or size after 12 weeks of JAK inhibitor therapy, or worsening splenomegaly after the start of JAK inhibitor therapy, as documented by an increase in spleen volume from its lowest point, or nadir, by 25% when measured by imaging, or an increase in spleen size when assessed by palpation. IMbark was originally conducted by Janssen as part of the Collaboration Agreement.
 The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the trial are spleen response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume assessed by imaging, and symptom response rate, defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a ≥50% reduction in Total Symptom Score, or TSS, at 24 weeks. Key secondary endpoints are safety and overall survival. Other secondary efficacy endpoints include the number of patients achieving complete remission, or CR, or partial remission, or PR, clinical improvement, or CI, and anemia, spleen and symptom responses. Exploratory endpoints include cytogenetic and molecular responses, as well as leukemia‑free survival. 
 The first patient in IMbark was dosed in September 2015 and the last patient was enrolled in October 2016. Janssen initiated a protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark in the second quarter of 2018. The IMbark protocol-specified primary analysis, which included an assessment of overall survival, or OS, coincided with the protocol-specified final analysis for the trial, due to an overlap in the dates triggering each analysis, which resulted in a joint primary/final analysis, which we refer to herein as the primary analysis. The results of this primary analysis and updated data on overall survival were presented at the ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2018. A summary of the results is below.

ASH Presentation Highlights 
 As reported in the ASH presentation, a total of 107 patients were enrolled in IMbark (48 in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm and 59 in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm). At the time of the April 26, 2018 clinical cut-off for the primary analysis, patients in IMbark had been followed for a median of 22.6 months (range: 0.2 – 27.4), including median treatment duration of 26.9 weeks (range: 0.2 – 118.1). Seven patients remained on active treatment and 50 patients were being followed for survival. The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in IMbark, as presented at ASH and highlighted below, indicate the advanced nature of the disease in, and the potential difficulty to treat, this patient population:

 Six patients (10%) in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm and no patients in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm had a spleen response per imaging. The spleen volume response rate observed, including in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm, was less than that reported in clinical trials with JAK inhibitors in front-line MF patients. Nineteen patients (32%) in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm and three patients (6%) in the 4.7 mg/kg dosing arm had a symptom response.
 For the assessment of OS, the clinical cut-off date for the ASH presentation was October 22, 2018. The median follow-up was 27.4 months (range: 0.2 – 33.0). The median OS in the 9.4 mg/kg dosing arm was 29.9 months. These and other efficacy data are also summarized in the table below:

 Most cytopenias resolved within four weeks. Grade 3/4 LFT elevations were observed in seven patients on study. An independent Hepatic Review Committee deemed that the observed LFT elevations were not imetelstat-related hepatic toxicities.
 Current Status of IMbark
 The trial has been officially closed to new patient enrollment since March 2018 and has entered an extension phase to enable patients remaining in the treatment phase to continue to receive imetelstat treatment, per investigator discretion. During the extension phase, which is being conducted by Janssen during the program transition period, standard data collection will primarily consist of safety information.
 In connection with the transition of the imetelstat program, we expect sponsorship for IMbark to be transferred from Janssen to us by the end of the second quarter of 2019. Once the IND transfer has been completed, we will be responsible for following patients in accordance with the extension phase protocol.
 For MF, we plan to discuss the results of the IMbark primary analysis, including the assessment of OS, with experts in MF, as well as regulatory authorities, to consider how these results compare with other therapies currently available to MF patients, and to gain a better understanding of the potential significance of these results to patients and physicians. We believe feedback from these discussions will provide important information on the feasibility, scope and design, including possible outcome measures, of any potential future clinical trials for imetelstat in Intermediate-2 or High-risk MF patients who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with a JAK inhibitor. We expect to outline our decision whether to continue late-stage development of imetelstat in MF by the end of the third quarter of 2019. This decision will be influenced by our assessment of what would be required to achieve clinical and regulatory success in MF, including the cost and duration of any potential clinical trials.

Transition from Janssen
 In December 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, pursuant to which Janssen conducted IMbark and IMerge. Janssen terminated the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018, and upon the effective date of termination, we regained the global rights to the imetelstat program. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required to provide operational support for the imetelstat program during transition of the program to us. Each company is responsible for its own costs incurred related to transition activities, unless otherwise specified in the Collaboration Agreement. We expect the transition process to be completed by September 2019 to enable the orderly transfer of all ongoing clinical, regulatory, medical affairs and non-clinical activities to us, including transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials from Janssen to us. In addition, following the effective date of termination of the Collaboration Agreement, we expect Janssen to supply imetelstat to us for up to 24 months during a transition period for clinical manufacturing and such supply will be charged to us at Janssen’s cost plus a premium. See “Licensing—Former Collaboration and License Agreement with Janssen” below, for more information about the Collaboration Agreement. 
 We have engaged Parexel International (IRL) Limited, or Parexel, a global contract research organization, or CRO, to support imetelstat clinical development activities. In addition to recently hiring a head of Pharmacovigilance and Drug Safety and a Chief Medical Officer in January of 2019, we are actively recruiting senior personnel to staff our internal drug development group, as well as contract with subject matter experts in clinical science, biostatistics, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, quality, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property, including patent protection, is very important to our business. We file patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of imetelstat, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 The development of biotechnology products, including imetelstat, typically includes the early development of a technology, followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and uses thereof, manufacturing processes, product formulation and administration methods. The result of this process is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product. Consequently, earlier filed, broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments, such as product formulations, so that patent expirations on a product may span several years. Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life.
 We endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business. Based on this monitoring, we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests. Such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate, filing oppositions against a patent, filing a request for post grant review against a patent or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a patent application or issued patent.
 Imetelstat
 We own issued patents in the United States, Europe and other countries related to imetelstat. Composition of matter patents generally provide the most material coverage, and therefore may convey competitive advantages. Because imetelstat is still under development, subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates. Examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind U.S. examination particularly where cases are filed first in the United States. It may be possible to obtain patent term extensions of some patents in some countries for claims covering imetelstat which could further extend the patent term.
 14



 
 | U.S. Patent Status / | Europe Patent Status / | Japan Patent Status /
-----------------------------------+----------------------+------------------------+----------------------
Product Candidate | Expiration Date | Expiration Date | Expiration Date 
Imetelstat (composition of matter) | Issued / 2025 | Issued / 2024 | Issued / 2024 

 
Our patent rights relating to imetelstat include those covering composition claims to the drug molecule and related nucleic acid telomerase inhibiting molecules, as well as reagents useful in manufacturing processes for the drug, and method of treatment and kit claims, certain of which are co‑owned with other entities. 
 Upon the effective date of termination of the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen on September 28, 2018, we regained all of the worldwide rights to imetelstat. In accordance with the termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license for intellectual property developed under the Collaboration Agreement for the further development of imetelstat, without any economic obligations to Janssen with respect to such license. Janssen has assigned to us certain intellectual property developed by it under the Collaboration Agreement.  We now bear all of the costs for maintaining, prosecuting and litigating all imetelstat intellectual property that we own.
 Telomerase
 Our U.S. patent rights relating to telomerase that cover technologies, such as variants of the protein component of human telomerase, or hTERT, are co‑owned with and in‑licensed exclusively from the University of Colorado. We expect the last of these U.S. patent rights to expire in 2019. A U.S. patent for identifying inhibitors of telomerase activity is in‑licensed from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California and will expire in 2019. The expiration of these patents is not expected to have any impact on our intellectual property rights related to imetelstat, or our continued planned development of imetelstat. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding our patent rights relating to telomerase. 
Licensing
 Former Collaboration and License Agreement with Janssen
 On November 13, 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid maligna
ncies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. 
 We regained the global rights to imetelstat upon Janssen’s termination of the Collaboration Agreement effective September 28, 2018. As a result of the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, we will not receive any further milestone payments or royalties from Janssen for the development or commercialization of imetelstat, including any clinical development or sales milestones, and Janssen has no further obligations to us or any third parties, such as clinical sites or vendors, to fund any of the ongoing or any potential future imetelstat clinical trials. 
 Under the termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required to provide certain operational support for the imetelstat program during transition of the program to us. The transition process is expected to occur through September 2019 to enable the orderly transfer of all ongoing clinical, regulatory, medical affairs and non-clinical activities to us, including the transfer of the sponsorship of ongoing imetelstat clinical trials from Janssen to us. Each company is responsible for costs incurred related to transition activities unless otherwise specified in the Collaboration Agreement. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required, among other things, to:
  
• | assign all regulatory files and regulatory clearances specific to imetelstat to us, including sponsorship of the ongoing clinical trials, IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transfer all safety data to us;
--+--------------------------------


• | facilitate negotiations between us and any subcontractors of Janssen performing development or manufacturing activities related to imetelstat;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | transfer any remaining inventory of imetelstat to us at Janssen’s cost plus a premium, and use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate an orderly and prompt transition of manufacturing activities to us; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 15


 
• | supply imetelstat drug product to us at Janssen’s cost plus a premium for up to 24 months following the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, while we seek to re-establish our own supply chain for clinical manufacturing of imetelstat.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Until the sponsorship responsibilities for imetelstat transfers from Janssen to us, including the U.S. Investigational New Drug, or IND, application and all foreign regulatory applications, Janssen will continue conducting IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge. Patients currently enrolled in IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge will continue to receive treatment and follow-up under the respective trial protocols. After September 28, 2018, the effective termination date of the Collaboration Agreement, our responsibility for imetelstat development costs, including ongoing conduct of the extension phase of IMbark and the Phase 2 portion of IMerge, and costs for the prosecution of patents that were licensed to Janssen under the Collaboration Agreement increased from 50% to 100%. In the second quarter of 2018, Janssen informed us that no patients remain on study or in follow-up in the Pilot Study. Therefore, we expect Janssen to close the Pilot Study, and the related IND under which the Pilot Study has been conducted will be inactivated. 
 For a further discussion of the Collaboration Agreement, see Note 4 on License Agreements in Notes to Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. Information about the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Transition of the Imetelstat Program from Janssen to Geron” included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.
 Other License Agreements
 In addition to the above agreement, we have also granted licenses to a number of other organizations in the ordinary course of our business to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of the imetelstat program. These include:

• | a license to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen Pharmaceuticals, an affiliate of Janssen, for the research, development and commercialization of products based on specialized oligonucleotide backbone chemistry and novel amidates for disorders, excluding cancers originating from the blood or bone marrow. In connection with this license, we also granted to Janssen Pharmaceuticals a non‑exclusive worldwide license under our patent rights covering the synthesis of monomers, which are the building blocks of oligonucleotides;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | two licenses, both of which will expire in 2019, to companies to use or commercialize telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | six licenses, five of which will expire in 2019, to companies to develop and commercialize reagent kits, or to provide services, for the measurement of telomere length or telomerase activity for research purposes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to a company to develop and commercialize a particular telomerase‑based technology for cancer detection; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a license to a company for the development of cancer immunotherapies for veterinary applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenues” for a further discussion of revenues from our license agreements. We expect revenues under our license agreements related to our telomerase technology to be eliminated by the end of 2019 due to upcoming patent expirations on such technology.
 Concentration of Revenues
 Our revenues were $1.1 million, $1.1 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Revenues” for additional detail regarding the composition of our revenues.
Manufacturing
 A typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat drug product includes the following key components:
  
• | starting materials, which are well‑defined raw materials that are used to make bulk drug substance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | bulk drug substance, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the treatment of disease; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | final drug product, which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In accordance with the termination provisions of the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is required to supply imetelstat drug product to us at Janssen’s cost plus a premium for up to 24 months following the termination of the Collaboration Agreement, while we seek to re-establish our own supply chain for clinical manufacturing of imetelstat. During the transition of the imetelstat program from Janssen to us, we plan to engage third‑party contractors to perform certain process development and other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as supply starting materials and manufacture drug substance and drug product. Many of these contractors previously had relationships with Geron related to the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat. 
 We do not have direct control over third‑party personnel or operations. These third‑party contractors, and/or any other contractors that we may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, typically complete their services on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements and may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production. These third‑party contractors, and/or any other contractors that we may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at a commercially reasonable cost. We are responsible for establishing any long‑term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third‑party contractors for imetelstat. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled “Risks Related to Manufacturing” and “Risks Related to Transition of the Imetelstat Program from Janssen to Geron” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
 Consultants
 To rebuild our drug development expertise, we have established, and expect to continue to establish, consulting agreements with drug development professionals, clinicians and regulatory experts with experience in numerous fields, including clinical science, biostatistics, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, quality, manufacturing and regulatory affairs. We retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement. Under such agreements, we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out‑of‑pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, we have in the past and may again in the future grant options to purchase our common stock to consultants, subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer, or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us. 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, the study of telomeres, telomerase, or our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.
 If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of lower risk MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators, such as lenalidomide by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene,; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; PI3 Kinase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; aminopeptidase inhibitors, such as tosedostat by CTI Biopharma 
 17


Corporation, or CTI Biopharma; TLR2-specific antibodies; TPO agonists, such as romiplostim by Amgen Inc.; anti-CD33 antibodies; anti-CD38 antibodies, such as daratumumab by Genmab A/S in collaboration with Janssen; anti-CD123 antibodies, such as talacotuzumab by Janssen; antagonists of Toll-like receptor signaling; retinoic acid receptor alpha agonists, such as SY-1425 by Syros Pharmaceuticals; hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, such as roxadustat by FibroGen, Inc.; Fas ligand inhibitors; immune checkpoint regulators; and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors.
 If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation’s ruxolitinib, or Jakafi®, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, Jakafi® reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from Jakafi® treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include erythropoiesis stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma, momelotinib by Sierra Oncology, and fedratinib by Celgene, which have reported results from Phase 3 clinical trials. Other investigational treatments for MF include inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, such as NS-018 by NS Pharma, Inc.; histone deacetylase inhibitors; interleukin-3 receptor targeted agents; inhibitors of heat shock protein 90; hypomethylating agents; PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors; anti-fibrosis antibodies, such as PRM-151 from Promedior, Inc.; hedgehog and SMO inhibitors; PIM kinase inhibitors; IAP inhibitors; anti-LOX2 inhibitors; recombinant pentraxin 2 protein; KIP-1 activators; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as sotatercept and luspatercept by Acceleron, in collaboration with Celgene; FLT inhibitors; BET inhibitors, such as CPI-0610 by Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; SMAC mimetics, such as LCL161 by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
 Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program.
 In addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on:
  
• | product efficacy and safety;
--+-----------------------------


• | convenience of product administration;
--+---------------------------------------


• | cost of manufacturing;
--+-----------------------


• | the timing and scope of regulatory consents;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | status of coverage and reimbursement;
--+--------------------------------------


• | price; and
--+-----------


• | patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we may be able to achieve with imetelstat. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their 
 18


products below what we may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause us to cease any further development or future commercialization of imetelstat, which would severely and adversely affect our financial results, business and business prospects, and the future of imetelstat, and might cause us to cease operations.
 Government Regulation
 Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of imetelstat. Imetelstat will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, potential human therapeutic products, such as imetelstat, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, import, export, distribution and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the sections entitled “Risks Related to the Development of Imetelstat” and “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Imetelstat” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors”.
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of a product candidate. The results of these trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any time, which prevents the conduct of clinical trials under the IND until safety concerns are addressed by the IND sponsor to the FDA’s satisfaction. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. The Phase 2 trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm, or not. If used, a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy. Safety and efficacy data from Phase 2 clinical trials, even if favorable, may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Phase 3, large scale, multi‑center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the trials. Human clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice regulations and applicable laws, with the oversight of Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human subjects. The manufacture of drug product candidates is subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices and applicable laws.
 The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of drugs and complete manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for review and for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, which may be waived in certain cases. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may approve the drug for commercialization, impose limitations on its indications for use and labeling, including in the form of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or may issue a complete response letter. Even if an NDA is approved, its sponsor is subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory compliance requirements.
 European and Other Regulatory Approval Process
 Prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the United States, a clinical trial application must be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted. Whether or not FDA clearance or approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in 
 19


such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, or EU, and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, or CPMP, provide a mechanism for EU member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established the EMA for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized procedure with which the marketing authorization is recognized in all EU member states and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 For a drug to qualify for orphan drug designation by the FDA, both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, and FDA’s implementing regulations. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA’s Office of Orphan Drug Products in order to support development of medicines for underserved or rare diseases and patient populations that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including, if regulatory approval is received, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity with certain limited exceptions and certain tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for a disease or condition other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was granted orphan drug designation. The granting of orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. The safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well‑controlled studies. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition.
 On June 11, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively.
 Orphan drug designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life‑threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In the EU, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, as well as protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. In addition, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug product approval, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable to not justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 On December 14, 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF.
 Fast Track Designation
 Fast Track designation provides opportunities for frequent interactions with FDA review staff, as well as eligibility for priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and rolling review. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of a New Drug Application to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. However, Fast Track designation does not accelerate conduct of clinical trials or mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent, nor does it ensure that imetelstat will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. In addition, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the imetelstat clinical development program.

In October 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to imetelstat for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low or Intermediate-1 risk MDS who are non-del(5q) and who are refractory or resistant to treatment with an ESA. 
 Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These additional healthcare regulations could affect our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third‑party payors. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti‑kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician payment sunshine laws.
 The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti‑Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act or ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation.
 Federal civil and criminal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act and its whistleblower or qui tam provisions that permit private individuals to bring an action on behalf of the government to enforce the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off‑label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information, upon entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in U.S. federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, 
 21


information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, including the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, from the European Union, or EU, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare, privacy and data security laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process or control compared to prior EU law, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. Likewise, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which has been characterized as the first “GDPR-like” privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions in the GDPR, that will go into effect beginning January 1, 2020, and we cannot determine the impact that such laws, regulations and standards will have on our business. In any event, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare or privacy laws, including the GDPR, in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other healthcare and privacy-related regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 Reimbursement and Healthcare Reform
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third‑party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for imetelstat.
 22


In the United States, third‑party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs, some of which are included in the Trump Administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019. Additionally, at the federal level, the Trump Administration released a “Blueprint” that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. On January 31, 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, proposed modifications to federal Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors which, among other things, will affect rebates paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, the purpose of which is to further reduce the cost of drug products to consumers. While a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost‑effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA‑approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco‑economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of imetelstat, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, imetelstat may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective.
 Moreover, the process for determining whether a third‑party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, as there is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in imetelstat.
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, the ACA, was signed into law that included a number of provisions of importance to the biopharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision which repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. 
 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In July 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. 
 23


District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. While the Texas U.S. District Court Judge, as well as the Trump administration and CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect pending appeal of the decision, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA. We expect that other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for imetelstat.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was enacted, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States to control the rising cost of healthcare.
