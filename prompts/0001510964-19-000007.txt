ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
CV Sciences, Inc. ("CV Sciences," "we," "our" or "us") was incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (“CannaVest Texas”), merged with CV Sciences, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation reflecting our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.”, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, we amended our Bylaws to reflect our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.” 
On December 30, 2015, we completed the acquisition of CanX, Inc., a Florida-based specialty pharmaceutical corporation ("CanX"). Acquired assets included in-process research and development, trade names and non-compete agreements associated with pharmaceutical product development programs and a line of consumer products.
We have two business segments; consumer products and specialty pharmaceutical. The consumer products segment develops, manufactures and markets products based on hemp-based Cannabidiol ("CBD"), including under the brand name PlusCBD™ in a variety of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care and specialty foods. The specialty pharmaceutical segment is developing drug candidates which use CBD as a primary active ingredient.
Current Operations
Consumer Products
We manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing hemp-based CBD under our PlusCBD™ brand in a range of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. We currently manufacture and distribute more than 50 stock-keeping units and we expect to continue to add new products to our PlusCBD™ portfolio to enhance our line of CBD and hemp-based consumer products. During 2018, we introduced gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that included balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels. We also expect to develop and launch new brands to more effectively market and sell certain products. We also sell raw materials acquired through our supply relationships in Europe to various customers that produce products for resale into the market.
We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements, and much more. The market for hemp-based products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and we believe CV Sciences is well positioned to be a significant player in the hemp industry.
Hemp-based CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.
We expect to realize revenue to fund our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital either through the issuance of equity and/or the issuance of debt. In the event we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital to fund our drug development efforts, we may need to curtail or delay such activity.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals
Our specialty pharmaceutical segment is developing cannabinoids to treat a range of medical indications. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contain two primary cannabinoids, CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired several drug development assets in the CanX acquisition, utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient.
Our first patent-pending product candidate, CVSI-007, combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (“FDA”) for treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. We believe this product candidate will provide treatment options for this significant unmet medical need. We are hopeful to be in a position to file an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) with the FDA in the next 12 months. We completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA in June 2017 and obtained guidance on this development program. CVSI-007 is based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable. In May 2016, we filed a patent application for these formulations and processes with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We are awaiting notice of a hearing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We anticipate the hearing to take place during 2019.

We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and IND preparation and development. Commercialization of future specialty pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support, and will require significant investment.
Description of our Subsidiaries
We own 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of two subsidiaries: Plus CBD, LLC (formerly, “Global Hemp Source, LLC”) (“Plus CBD”), and CANNAVEST Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed in connection with the CanX Acquisition. We previously owned a 70% interest in CannaVest Europe, GmbH. On January 20, 2017, we filed for dissolution of CannaVest Europe, GmbH, with the District Court, Dusseldorf Germany, effective December 31, 2016. CannaVest Europe GmbH did not have any assets or liabilities at the time of its dissolution.
Inventory and Sales
Based on expected increasing demand, we have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We have historically sourced our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for hemp-based consumer products well into the future. Our current raw material inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through 2019, resulting in reduced cash outflow for raw material inventory purchases.
Government Regulation
We are subject to local and federal laws in our operating jurisdictions. We hold required licenses for product production and distribution and monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements. 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the "2018 Farm Bill" is United States federal legislationsigned into law on December 20, 2018 which provides much of the legal framework for the hemp-based CBD product category. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from this legislation includes the ability for farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture programs for certification and competitive grants. While the DEA is now officially not involved in hemp regulation, the FDA retains its authority to regulate ingestible and topical products, including those that contain hemp and hemp extracts such as CBD.
A range of federal regulations govern our product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111. DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD which is an extract of a botanical (Cannabis sativa L. plant). CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use our PlusCBD™ brand oil to develop consumer products for distribution. The number of “mainstream” commercial and retail stores that currently stock and sell our products is increasing primarily through customer awareness. We believe that as awareness grows for the “green”, environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp/cannabis, the consumer market will adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with the components of hemp.
Our target customers for our consumer product segment are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufacturers of products that can readily replace their raw base materials for our base materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. In the future, we intend to target national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. In addition, we are directly pursuing distribution opportunities

with national retailers. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.
Competition
There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC have focused on hemp-based CBD formulations; while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, consisting of publicly- and privately-owned companies. There are also large, well-funded companies that have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp-based product category in the U.S. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing CBD product category. 
Intellectual Property
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks including, but not limited to CV Sciences and Plus CBD. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High CBD Content. This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD and expires in 2033.
We have a pending patent application for our product candidate CVSI-007 in the United States that will expire in 2036. CVSI-007 combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tabacco use and addiction. 
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We intend to file for patent protection on our pharmaceutical products based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology.
Research and Development
Our research and development costs have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expense, facilities and equipment expense and other costs related to both our consumer product and drug development business segments. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred in the ongoing development of new consumer products and in development of our drug candidate CVSI-007. We incurred research and development expenses of $1.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.
Source and Availability of Raw Materials
We have historically sourced raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply, and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for hemp-based consumer products well into the future. Our current inventory levels are sufficient to support sales through 2019, resulting in reduced cash outflow for raw material inventory purchases.
Environmental Matters
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 81 employees, which included 78 full-time and 3 part-time employees. In addition to our full-time employees, we contract with third-parties for the conduct of certain preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities related to drug development efforts. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
