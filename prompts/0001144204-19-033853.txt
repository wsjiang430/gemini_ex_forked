Overview
 
Senmiao Technology Limited (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terminology) is a U.S. holding company incorporated in the State of Nevada. We currently have two operating businesses segments: (i) automobile transaction and related services focusing on the ride-hailing industry in People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”) through our majority owned subsidiary, Hunan Ruixi Financial Leasing Co., Ltd., a PRC limited liability company (“Hunan Ruixi”), its wholly owned subsidiary, Hunan Ruixi Automobile Leasing Co., Ltd. (“Ruixi Leasing”) and variable interest entity (“VIE”), Sichuan Jinkailong Automobile Leasing Co., Ltd. (“Jinkailong”) (the “Automobile Transaction and Related Services”); and (ii) online lending services through its VIE, Sichuan Senmiao Ronglian Technology Co., Ltd. (“Sichuan Senmiao”), which facilitates loan transactions between Chinese investors and individual and small-to-medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) borrowers (our “Online Lending Services”). Our executive offices are located in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China. Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China.
 
During the years ended March 31, 2019, we generated revenue of $2,551,107 from our Automobile Transaction and Related Services and $369,956 from our Online Lending Services. While we have historically focused our efforts on our Online Lending Services segment, due to the increased regulation of peer-to-peer lending services in China, as described below (see “Business — Regulations”), and general business opportunities that have become available to us, we have reallocated our resources to focus on our Automobile Transaction and Related Services segment of our business.
 
Our Corporate History 
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 8, 2017. We have established a wholly owned subsidiary, Sichuan Senmiao Zecheng Business Consulting Co., Ltd. (“Senmiao Consulting”), in China. As of the date of this Report, Senmiao Consulting provides services to Sichuan Senmiao, one of our VIEs, pursuant to the VIE Agreements as defined below. Senmiao Consulting and Sichuan Senmiao conduct a major portion of our research and development activities.
 
Sichuan Senmiao was established in China in June 2014. We have entered into a series of contractual arrangements (the “VIE Agreements”) with Sichuan Senmiao and each of its equity holders through Senmiao Consulting to obtain control and become the primary beneficiary of Sichuan Senmiao. The contractual arrangements have been in place since the establishment of Senmiao Consulting (the “Restructuring”).
 
On September 25, 2016, Sichuan Senmiao acquired a peer-to-peer (“P2P”) platform (including website, internet content provider (“ICP”) registration, operating systems, servers, management system, employees and users) from Sichuan Chenghexin Investment and Asset Management Co., Ltd. (“Chenghexin”), which had established and operated the platform for two years prior to our acquisition (the “Acquisition”), for a total cash consideration of RMB 69,690,000 (approximately US$10.1 million).
 
Prior to the Acquisition, Sichuan Senmiao was a holding company that owned a 60% equity interest in an equity investment fund management company. Sichuan Senmiao sold its 60% equity interest for a cash consideration of RMB 60 million (approximately US$8.9 million) immediately following the Acquisition, in order to focus on the online marketplace lending business.
 
On November 21, 2018, we entered into an Investment and Equity Transfer Agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with Hunan Ruixi and all the shareholders of Hunan Ruixi, pursuant to which we acquired an aggregate of 60% of the equity interest of Hunan Ruixi for no consideration. We closed the acquisition on November 22, 2018 and agreed to make a cash contribution of $6,000,000 to Hunan Ruixi, representing 60% of its registered capital, in accordance with the Investment Agreement.

Hunan Ruixi has a wholly owned subsidiary, Ruixi Leasing, a PRC limited liability company formed in April 2018 with a registered capital of RMB 10 million (approximately US$1.5 million). Ruixi Leasing is licensed to engage in automobile sales and leasing and has not commenced operations as of the date of this Report.
 
Hunan Ruixi also owns 35% equity interest in Jinkailong and control the remaining 65% equity interest through a voting agreement with Jinkailong’s other shareholders. Jinkailong is an automobile transaction and related services company in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China, which primarily targets drivers in the ride-hailing service sector and facilitates automobile sales and financing transactions for its clients and provides relevant after-transaction services to them.
 
In May 2019, we formed Yicheng Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (“Yicheng”), a PRC limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary, with a registered capital of $50 million in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, China. Yicheng has obtained its business licenses for automobiles sale and financial leasing on May 5, 2019 and has been engaged in automobile sales since June 2019.

The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, including our subsidiaries and our VIEs as of the date of this Report:
 

VIE Agreements with Sichuan Senmiao
 
According to the VIE Agreements, Sichuan Senmiao is obligated to pay Senmiao Consulting service fees equal to its net income. Sichuan Senmiao’s entire operations are controlled by the Company. There are no unrecognized revenue-producing assets that are held by Sichuan Senmiao.
 
Each of the VIE Agreements is described in details below:
 
Equity Interest Pledge Agreement
 
Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and all the shareholders of Sichuan Senmiao (the “Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders”) entered into an Equity Interest Pledge Agreement, pursuant to which the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders pledged all of their equity interest in Sichuan Senmiao to Senmiao Consulting in order to guarantee the performance of Sichuan Senmiao’s obligations under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement as described below.

Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement
 
Pursuant to an Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement entered by and among the Company, WFOE, Sichuan Senmiao and each of Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders, Senmiao Consulting will provide Sichuan Senmiao with complete technical support, business support and related consulting services for 10 years ended September 18, 2027. The Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders and Sichuan Senmiao will not engage any third party for the same or similar consultation services without Senmiao Consulting’s prior consent. Further, the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders are entitled to receive an aggregate of 20,250,000 shares of common stock of the Company under the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement. Senmiao Consulting may terminate the Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement at any time upon prior written notice to Sichuan Senmiao and the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders.
Exclusive Option Agreement
 
Pursuant to an Exclusive Option Agreement entered by and among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders, the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders have granted Senmiao Consulting an exclusive option to purchase at any time their equity interests in Sichuan Senmiao at a purchase price equal to the capital paid by the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders in whole or at a pro-rated price for any partial purchase. The Exclusive Option Agreement terminates after 10 years ending September 18, 2027 but can be renewed by Senmiao Consulting at its discretion.
Powers of Attorney
 
Each of the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders has signed a power of attorney (the “Power of Attorney”), pursuant to which, each of the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders has authorized Senmiao Consulting to act as his or her exclusive agent and attorney with respect to all rights of such individual as a shareholder of Sichuan Senmiao, including but not limited to: (a) attending shareholders’ meetings; (b) exercising all the shareholder’s rights that shareholders are entitled to under PRC laws and the Articles of Association of Sichuan Senmiao, including but not limited to voting, sale, transfer, pledge and disposition of the equity interests of Sichuan Senmiao; and (c) designating and appointing the legal representative, chairperson, director, supervisor, chief executive officer and other senior management members of Sichuan Senmiao. The Power of Attorney has the same term as the Exclusive Option Agreement.
Timely Report Agreement
 
The Company and Sichuan Senmiao entered into a Timely Report Agreement, pursuant to which, Sichuan Senmiao agrees to make its officers and directors available to the Company and promptly provide all information required by the Company so that the Company can make necessary filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and other regulatory reports in a timely fashion.
 
The Company has concluded that it should consolidate the financial statements with Sichuan Senmiao because it is Sichuan Senmiao’s primary beneficiary based on the Power of Attorney from the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders, who assigned their rights as shareholders of Sichuan Senmiao to Senmiao Consulting, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. These rights include, but are not limited to, attending shareholders’ meetings, voting on matters submitted for shareholder approval and appointing legal representatives, directors, supervisors and senior management of Sichuan Senmiao. As a result, the Company, through Senmiao Consulting, is deemed to hold all of the voting equity interests in Sichuan Senmiao. Pursuant to Exclusive Business Cooperation Agreement, Senmiao Consulting shall provide complete technical support, business support and related consulting services for 10 years. Though not explicit in the VIE Agreements, the Company may provide financial support to Sichuan Senmiao to meet its working capital requirements and capitalization purposes. The terms of the VIE Agreements and the Company’s plan to provide financial support to Sichuan Senmiao were considered in determining that the Company is the primary beneficiary of Sichuan Senmiao. Accordingly, the financial statements of Sichuan Senmiao are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
The Restructuring constituted a reorganization. As all of the above mentioned companies are under common control, this series of transactions are considered as a reorganization of the entities under common control at carrying value and the consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the reorganization had occurred retroactively. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the existing corporate structure had been in existence throughout all periods and the reorganization had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Voting Agreement with Jinkailong’s Other Shareholders
 
In addition to obtaining 35% equity interests in Jinkailong, Hunan Ruixi, Jinkailong and other Jinkailong’s shareholders holding an aggregate of 65% equity interests entered into a voting agreement, as amended (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which all other Jinkailong’s shareholders will vote in concert with Hunan Ruixi on numerous corporate matters including all fundamental corporate transactions in the event of a disagreement for a period of 20 years, ending on August 25, 2038.
 
The Company has consolidated the financial statements of Jinkailong into its financial statements because it is Jinkailong’s primary beneficiary based on the Voting Agreement. Though not explicit in the business cooperation agreement by and among Jinkailong, Hunan Ruixi, and other shareholders of Hunan Ruixi, the Company may provide financial support to Jinkailong to meet its working capital requirements and capitalization purposes. The terms of the Voting Agreement and the Company’s plan to provide financial support to Jinkailong were considered in determining that the Company is the primary beneficiary of Jinkailong. Accordingly, the financial statements of Jinkailong are consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Although we are able to consolidate the financial statements of Jinkailong, we are only entitled to distribution of dividends and assets based on our ownership of 35% of the equity interest of Jinkailong. However, pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we are entitled to dividend and liquidation preference.
 
Our Services 
 
Our Automobile Transaction and Related Services
 
Overview
 
Our Automobile Transaction and Related Services are mainly comprised of (i) facilitation of automobile transaction and financing where we connect the prospective ride-hailing drivers to financial institutions to buy, or get financing on the purchase of, cars to be used to provide ride-hailing services (the “auto financing and transaction facilitation”); (ii) automobile sales where we procure new cars from dealerships and sell them to our customers in the automobile financing facilitation business (the “auto sales”); and (iii) automobile financing where we provide our customers with auto finance solutions through financing leases (the “auto financing”). We started our facilitation services in November 2018 and the sale of automobiles in January 2019. As of March 31, 2019, we have facilitated financing for an aggregate of 311 automobiles with total value of approximately $4.1 million and have sold an aggregate of 212 automobiles with total value of approximately $1.8 million. Our auto financing business did not commence until the end of March 2019 and has seen a slow growth to date. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, our auto financing and transaction facilitation and auto sales accounted for 21.1% and 62.2% of our total revenue, respectively.
Auto Financing and Transaction Facilitation
 
Leveraging the growing popularity of ride-hailing services in China, we facilitate the auto financing transactions between the ride-hailing drivers and financial institutions. As of the date of this Report, all the ride-hailing drivers we service are affiliated Didi Chuxing Technology Co., Ltd., a major transportation company operating the largest ride-hailing platform in China (“Didi”). Our services simplify the transaction process for both the Didi drivers and the financial institutions. Specifically, our facilitation services include purchase services and management and guarantee services.
 
Purchase services cover a wide range of services provided to Didi drivers during the process of an automobile financing transaction, including but not limited to, credit assessment, preparation of financing application materials, assistance with closing of financing transactions, license and plate registration, payment of taxes and fees, purchase of insurance, installment of GPS devices, ride-hailing driver qualification and other administrative procedures. Our service fees are based on the sales price of the automobiles and relevant services provided. Our service fees for automobiles purchase services ranged from $500 to $4,000 per vehicle.
 
The management and guarantee services are provided to Didi drivers after the delivery of automobiles, covering (i) management services including, without limitation, ride-hailing driver training, assisting with purchase of insurances, insurance claims and after-sale automobile services, handling traffic violations and other consulting services; and (ii) guarantee services for the obligations of Didi drivers under their financing arrangement with financial institutions. As at March 31, 2019, the maximum contingent liabilities we were exposed would be approximately $11.5 million if all the automobile purchasers defaulted. Our management and guarantee fees are based on the costs of our services and the results of our credit assessment of the automobile purchasers. Our fees average approximately $1,100 per automobile for the affiliation period and are paid by the Didi drivers on a monthly basis during the affiliation period.

Transaction Process
 
The following chart illustrates our typical process of auto financing facilitation.
 

Financing Partners
 
We have established collaboration with a number of financial institutions, including commercial banks, financial leasing companies as well as online peer-to-peer lending platforms, which finance the purchase of automobiles by our automobile purchasers through financial leasing agreements or loan agreements (the “Financing Agreements”). Under our arrangements with financing partners, we will refer prospective automobile purchasers and are generally responsible for collecting information on such purchasers, conducting credit assessment of them, registration of the cars as collateral with government and providing guarantee on the their payments under the Financing Agreements. To secure the interests of the financing partners, each automobile is mortgaged in favor of the financing partner which is registered with relevant local government agencies.
 
We typically prepay the purchase price and expenses on behalf of the automobile purchasers when we provide purchase services and collect all the advance payment and relevant services fees from the proceeds disbursed by the financial institutions upon the closing of the financing and/or when the monthly installment payment made by automobile purchasers during the term of the Financing Agreements. We are required under our arrangements with the financing partners to make payments on behalf of the automobile purchasers in the event of default. As of March 31, 2019, the outstanding payments we made on behalf of defaulted purchasers were approximately $0.15 million. After we make payments, we will request the defaulted purchasers to pay us back. If we are unable to recover the payments within a certain period of time, we will start our collection process. See “Business — Our Services — Our Automobile Transaction and Related Services — Post-Financing Services.”
 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, our top two financing partners were Sichuan Jinding Fortune Information Technology Co., Ltd. and Haitong Unitrust International Leasing Co., Ltd., which collectively financed an aggregate of 191 cars with a total value of approximately $1.9 million, representing approximately 83.9% of the transaction value financed by our financing partners as of March 31, 2019.

Partnership with Didi
 
To capitalize on the large and rapidly expanding fleet of Didi, we have established collaboration with Didi through both Hunan Ruixi and Jinkailong. Under Jinkailong’s consulting service agreement with Didi, Jinkailong provides vehicle leasing and financing, insurance facilitation, affiliated vehicle management, and other services for the fleet of Didi in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province. Hunan Ruixi also entered into cooperation agreements with Didi in December 2018, pursuant to which Hunan Ruixi agreed to source automobiles for and provide automobile financing/leasing solutions to Didi drivers in Changsha City, Hunan Province. Our relationship with Didi is crucial to our business as it enables us to attract more automobile purchasers who are interested in working as Didi drivers and becoming affiliated with us.
Partnership with Feiniu
 
Jinkailong also entered into a business cooperation agreement with Sichuan Feiniu Automobile Transportation Co., Ltd. (“Feiniu”), a provider of intercity passenger transportation and freight logistics services and provider of consulting services to Didi’s drivers on intercity carpool business. Pursuant to the business cooperation agreement, Jinkailong agreed to provide automobile and driver sourcing services as Feiniu’s exclusive business partner for Feiniu’s intercity carpool business in Chengdu City, Sichuan Province for a period of three years. In return, Feiniu agreed to pay Jinkailong 30% of the consulting service fee Feiniu receives under its agreement with Didi for the proportion of automobiles supplied by Jinkailong. In addition, Jinkailong agreed to refer no less than 30% of its customers to subscribe for Feiniu’s automobile management services, including automobile purchase, title registration, insurance purchase and financing.
Auto Transaction Facilitation Services
 
Through Hunan Ruixi and Jinkailong, we also facilitate automobile purchase transactions between dealers, our cooperative third party sales teams and the automobile purchasers, primarily Didi drivers. We provide sales venue and vehicle sourcing for the transactions. We charge third party sales teams and automobile purchasers a facilitation fee based on the type of vehicle and negotiation with each dealer, third party sales team and purchaser, generally no more than $1,700 per automobile from third party sales team and $2,200 from the purchaser.
 
We also provide a series of services for the purchasers throughout the automobile purchase transaction process, including registration of license plates and permits from the relevant government authorities, insurance facilitation and assistance with applications to financial institutions to finance the purchase. Our service fees are based on the sales price of the automobiles and relevant services provided. Our service fees ranged from approximately $500 to $4,000 per vehicle.
 
Auto Sales
 
We are also engaged in the sales of automobiles through Hunan Ruixi. As we are targeting to sell cars to Didi, Hunan Ruixi procures new cars of model and specification acceptable to Didi. Hunan Ruixi typically sets up periodic procurement plans based on the estimated transaction volume of Jinkailong and buy in bulk to obtain better pricing. Hunan Ruixi will then mark up the price and sell the cars to the ride-hailing drivers who are typically customers in our auto financing facilitation services. All the new cars Ruixi procured are parked in our warehouses in Chengdu City.
 
Substantially all of the cars are sold through a financing arrangement, under which we will receive a majority of the purchase price (ranging from approximately 69% to 100%) from the financing proceeds and the remainder from monthly installment payments of the Didi drivers.
 
Auto Financing
 
We began offering auto financing services in March 2019. In our self-operated financing, we act as a lessor and a customer (i.e., Didi driver) acts as a lessee. We offer to the lessee a selection of automobiles that were purchased by us in advance. The lessee will choose the desirable automobile to be purchased and enter into a financing lease with us. During the term of the financing lease, the lessee will have use rights with respect to the automobile. We will obtain title to the automobile upfront and retain such title during the term of the financing lease, as lessor. At the end of the lease term, the lessee will pay a minimal price and obtain full title to the automobile after the financing lease is repaid in full. In connection with the financing lease, the lessee will enter into a service agreement with us. Pursuant to this service agreement, the lessee will pay us a service fee ranging from approximately $1,250 to approximately $3,500 for our services, which covers, among others, payment of purchase taxes and insurance, license and plate registration, and training of ride-hailing drivers.

--

 

As of the date of this Report, we have financed the purchase of 87 automobiles with an average financing amount per customer of approximately $19,000 and lease terms ranging from 36 to 48 months. The interest rates of our auto financing are fixed and range from 5.5% to 11.4% per annum. No down payment is required under our financing leases.
 
Customers
 
Over 95% of our customers are Didi drivers. Due to the complexity and difficulty of obtaining registration of various licenses required for driving a ride-hailing car, our customers choose to become affiliated with us who offer them a simplified and smooth process to become qualified. Our automobile purchasers, who are mostly Didi drivers, typically become affiliated with us through affiliation agreements pursuant to which we, as a qualified management company, provide them post-transaction management services during the affiliation period, which is usually the same as the term of the Financing Agreements.
 
We acquire customers for our Automobile Transaction and Related Services through the network of third-party sales teams, referral from Didi and our own efforts including online advertising and billboard advertising. We also send out flyers and participate in trade shows to advertise our services. Since our acquisition of Hunan Ruixi through the date of this Report, we have serviced approximately 740 customers, including approximately 700 Didi drivers.
 
Risk Management 
 
The assessment of prospective Didi drivers is based on collective efforts and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the automobile buyers. In our auto financing facilitation business, assessment on a prospective buyer typically involves three parties: financial institutions, Didi and us. As financial institution makes the ultimate decision on the financing application and the financing terms and Didi determines the outcome of the driver qualification process, we do not maintain a credit grading system. We believe our manual review and verification process is sufficient for the requirements of our current operations.
 
We conduct an initial screening when we receive an application from the prospective Didi drivers based on credit reports from People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”) and third party credit rating companies, and personal information including residence, ethnicity group, driving history and involvement in legal proceeding. An initially qualified candidate must meet certain minimum criteria:
 

· | be between 22-60 years old; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reside in the mainland of China;
--+---------------------------------


· | have a driving history of at least three years;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | not be subject to on-going legal proceedings or enforcement;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | not be listed on a national delinquent debtor’s list;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | have a real intension to purchase automobile; and
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | the value of purchased automobile matches the income of the candidate. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, we arrange a simple in-person interview with the applicant where we gather information on marital/family status, income, assets, borrowing history and default history, if any. This interview is typically conducted by our risk management staff who will verify the accuracy of information on the prospective driver by cross-checking information provided by the applicant with other sources. We will also assess the prospective driver’s potential repayment ability.
 

11
--

 

Applicants with any of the follow attributes will be rejected:
 

· | engaging in illegal or criminal activities;
--+--------------------------------------------


· | involved in pornography, gambling, drug dealing and gangster activities and experiences; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | engaging in usury lending; or
--+------------------------------


· | providing fraudulent information.
--+----------------------------------

 
Once we have completed our risk assessments on the applicant, we recommend qualified applicants to the financial institution who proactively reviews and makes final credit decisions on the applications we recommend. Specifically, the financial institution is ultimately responsible for, reviewing applications and verifying applicants’ personal information collected by us through various procedures.
 
We also share the driver’s personal information with Didi, who requires all the drivers to be qualified under their own standard and conduct a background check on each driver applicant. A qualified driver must meet certain minimum criteria:
 

· | be 22 to 60 years old for male; 22 to 55 years old for females; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have a driving history of at least three years with driving license of C2 or above; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | must not commit the a hit-and-run;
--+-----------------------------------


· | have no record of dangerous driving, drug use, driving under alcoholic influence, and violence crime; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have no traffic violation of 12 demerit points or more in any year of the past three years; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have not had their tax driver’s license revoked in Chengdu City within the past five years; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have not been investigated or disciplined for unlawfully engaging in taxi services or other passenger transportation operations in Chengdu City within the past five years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our assessment of prospective lessees in our auto financing business is substantially similar.
 
Post-Financing Services
 
Our post financing management department is in charge of monitoring and managing monthly payments by the drivers. We send text messages and make phone calls as reminders three business days prior to the due date. If a driver fails to pay on the due day, we will pay the financial institution on behalf of the defaulted automobile purchaser but continue to contact the automobile purchaser and request for payments. If the delinquency continues for more than 15 days, we then seek to repossess the car. Every car purchased through us has a GPS device installed, which helps us locate the car. After a car is repossessed, we store it in a warehouse and later dispose of the automobile in accordance with law and relevant financing documents. If we are unable to repossess collateral from a delinquent automobile purchaser, we may commence a lawsuit against such purchaser.
 
Our Online Lending Services
 
Overview 
 
We operate an online lending platform through Sichuan Senmiao in the PRC which facilitates loan transactions between Chinese investors and individual and SME borrowers. Through our platform, we offer access to credit for borrowers and attractive investment returns for investors. As described further below, due to an increase in PRC regulations relating to and scrutiny of the P2P lending industry in China, during our fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we have we have reallocated our resources away from our Online Lending Services business to focus on the Automobile Transaction and Related Services segment of our business.
 
From the acquisition of our online platform in September 2016 through March 31, 2019, we have facilitated loan transactions in an aggregate amount of over RMB729 million (approximately US$109 million). As of March 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of 42,903 registered users and a total of 3,247 investors and 2,695 borrowers had participated in loan transactions through our platform. We currently conduct our business operations exclusively in China, and all of our investors and borrowers are located in China.
 
Our revenues from Online Lending Services are primarily generated from fees charged for our services in matching investors with borrowers. We charge borrowers transaction fees for the work we perform through our platform and charge our investors service fees on their actual investment returns. The interest rates of the loans facilitated through our platform range from 7.68% to 10.80% per annum.
 

12
--

 

We charge borrowers transaction fees based on their loan amounts. The transaction fees charged to borrowers range from 0.19% to 4.93% of the loan amount and are paid (i) for loans accruing interest on a monthly basis, upon disbursement of the loan proceeds and (ii) for loans accruing interest on a daily basis, upon full repayment of principal and interest. We also charge our investors a service fee of 8.00% of their actual investment returns, and collect the fee when the investors receive their interest payments. Our interest rates, transaction fees, service fees and other charges are all disclosed to the users of our platform.
 
Recent Regulatory Developments for Online Lending Platforms
    In January 2019, relevant PRC governmental authorities issued Circular on the Classification and Disposal of Risks of Online Lending Institutions and Risk Prevention (“Circular 175”). According to Circular 175, except for large-scale peer-to-peer direct lending marketplaces that are strictly in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and have not demonstrated any high-risk characteristics, which are generally referred to as Normal Marketplaces, other marketplaces, including shell companies with no substantive operation, small-scale marketplaces, marketplaces with high risks and marketplaces that are unable to repay investors or otherwise unable to operate their businesses, shall exit the peer-to-peer lending industry or cease operation. Normal Marketplaces shall cease operating those businesses that are not in compliance with laws and regulations. Circular 175 also encourages certain Normal Marketplaces to convert into other types of online financing institutions such as online small loan companies or loan facilitation platforms. Circular 175 provides that “small-scale marketplace” shall be determined by each province taking into consideration a marketplace’s outstanding loan balance, number of lenders and other factors. There is no guidance on the definition of “small-scale marketplaces” in Sichuan Province as of the date of this Report. If we are considered a small-scale marketplace under Circular 175 as determined by Sichuan province, we may have to cease our Online Lending Services or convert into other types of online financing institutions.
 Historical Operation 
 
Historically, our platform was also accessible to creditors (“Creditor Partners”) who had extended loans to borrowers outside our platform and assigned these loans on our platform to obtain interim financing before loan maturities. We generated revenue from transaction fees from Creditor Partners in connection with the assignment of their loans on our platform.
 
In January 2018, we discontinued the loan assignment services to Creditor Partners in preparation for our record-filing under the newly promulgated regulations of the marketplace lending industry in China. To continue our relationship with these Creditor Partners, we signed cooperation agreements with them pursuant to which they would introduce their customers with financing needs to us and provide guaranty for them.
 
In February 2018, Sichuan Province (where we conduct a significant portion of our operations) issued local guidelines on the rectification and acceptance of internet lending information intermediaries, which require guarantors for the loans facilitated by lending platforms to be guaranty institutions or insurance companies that hold professional guaranty qualifications. Our Creditor Partners do not hold the guarantor qualifications. To comply with the local guidelines and also as part of our preparation for our record filing under the new marketplace lending regulations and as requested by the local Sichuan finance bureau in connection with their inspection of our operations, we ceased our cooperation with our Creditor Partners in March 2018 and began to focus on facilitating loan transactions solely between borrowers and investors on our platform.
 
As described further below under section “Business — Regulations,” the recent promulgation of Chinese national, provincial and local regulations related to market place lending platforms may require us to cease our online lending services or change our business model as we seek to develop other sources of revenue and comply with these regulations.”
 
User Acquisition
 
In light of various laws, regulations and rules to regulate the marketplace lending industry in China promulgated by multiple PRC governmental authorities, in particular the requirement not to increase the transaction volume of our platform, we have reduced our spending on marketing and our user acquisition efforts have been limited to advertising on our websites and WeChat official account and issuance of press releases.

Our Borrowers
 
We service both individuals and SME borrowers. We acquire our borrowers primarily through our own efforts, including advertising through Websites and WeChat official account and issuance of press releases. The borrowers are generally looking for short-term financings below RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$145,590) to fund their cash flow requirement. For the year ended March 31, 2019, we have facilitated loans to over 120 borrowers with an aggregate principal amount of approximately RMB 151 million (approximately US$22.74 million).
Our Investors
 
We accept investments from individual investors of all income levels. 
 
For the year ended March 31, 2019, 213 investors made investments totaling approximately RMB 151 million (approximately US$22.7 million) through our platform. During this period, average annual investment return for investors on our platform was 7.99%. As of March 31, 2019, we had over 3,247 investors on our platform.   
Products Offered to Borrowers
 
We facilitate unsecured, fixed-rate loans to individual borrowers who need to finance personal purchases and SME borrowers who are in need of capital for business operations. Currently, the loans offered on our platform have terms ranging from 1 month to 36 months.
 
Pursuant to the requirement of the Interim Measures for the Administration of Business Activities of Online Lending Information Intermediaries (the “Interim Measures”), we do not permit individual borrowers to hold loans with aggregated outstanding principal of more than RMB 200,000 (approximately US$29,100) or SME borrowers to hold loans with aggregated outstanding principal of more than RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$145,592).
 
Loans facilitated on our platform range in the amount of RMB 32,000 (approximately US$4,660) to RMB 200,000 (US$29,100) for individual borrowers and RMB 70,000 (approximately US$10,190) to RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$145,590) for SMEs. Our loans currently outstanding include loans of one month, three months, six months and 36 months. The annual interest rate for loans averaged 8.39% for the year ended March 31, 2019.
 
For the year ended March 31, 2019, we facilitated loans to over 120 borrowers through our platform and the total amount of funds loaned to borrowers through our platform was approximately RMB 151 million (approximately US$22.7 million).
 
Interest rates for the term loans on our platform currently range from 7.68% to 10.8% per annum. We also charge borrowers transaction fees for our services ranging from 0.19% to 4.93% The transaction fee is charged as a percentage of the loan amount and is typically paid up-front at the time of the disbursement of loan proceeds for loans accruing interest on a monthly basis and upon full payment of principal and interest of loans accruing interest on a daily basis. We recognize revenues generated from transaction fees when the loan transactions are closed and invoices for such fees are issued. The interest rate and transaction fee represent the total cost of borrowing for borrowers.

A penalty fee for late payment is imposed as a percentage of the amount past due and will be paid to the investors should a default occur. All fees are clearly disclosed to the borrowers. As of the date of this Report, we have not collected any penalty for late payment because there has not been any default or delinquencies since we acquired our online lending platform.
 
We do not allow loan rollovers, i.e., the repayment of a loan using proceeds from a new loan. Therefore, a borrower may not take another loan unless the existing loan is fully paid off.
 
Services Offered to Investors
 
Through our platform, investors have the opportunity to invest in a range of loan products with attractive returns. We provide our investors with an automated investing tool with which an investor can invest a specified amount of money to borrowers through our platform for a specified period of time. Once an investor commits funds to invest, the funds are automatically allocated among approved borrowers. Our automated investing tool automatically reinvests investors' funds as long as there are sufficient funds in the investor's account, enabling investors to automatically reinvest without having to continually revisit our website or mobile application. Investors using our automated investing tool are allowed to withdraw their funds before a loan is fully subscribed. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, over 14% of the funds invested by investors through our platform were invested utilizing this automated investing tool.
 
The minimum threshold for a lending commitment made through our automated investing tool is RMB 100 (approximately US$14.64). For the year ended March 31, 2019, the average amount invested through our automated investing tool by each investor was approximately RMB 24,404 (approximately US$3,753). The annual rate of return offered to an investor after deducting the management fee varies with the duration of the investment term, with 7.07% to 7.23% for loans with a term of 30 days or less and 7.07% to 9.94% for a loan with a term of longer than 30 days but up to 36 months.
 
We charge investors a management fee for using our investing platform. The management fee is equal to 8.00% of the interest that investors receive, and is paid at the time of each interest payment. There is no service fee if there's no investment made from investors. We recognize revenues for services provided to investors when such fees are paid.
 
Transaction Process
 
Our platform provides a streamlined application process for borrowers and investors alike. The entire process from initial application to disbursement of funds on average takes approximately seven days. The following illustrates the entire application and funding process through our platform:
Stage 1: Application
 
Our borrower application process begins with the submission of a loan application by a prospective borrower. Borrowers can apply through our website or mobile application. As part of the application process, the prospective borrower is asked to provide various personal and business details. The specific personal and business details required will depend upon the borrower's desired loan product, but typically include PRC identity card information, employer information, bank account information, credit card information and a credit report from the PBOC. For business, they will need business registration certificate, tax certificate, financial report, bank statements and credit report from the PBOC. Our borrowers are also required to designate the use of loan proceeds in their loan applications. After loan proceeds are disbursed, we will follow up with telephone calls to confirm such designated use of proceeds. However, due to the lack of detailed regulations, implementation measures and guidance on regulations concerning our industry, it is unclear what measures are required to verify the use of proceeds. We believe our current practice is sufficient in light of the type of loans facilitated and our transaction volume.
 
New investors sign up to our platform using a simple online portal in which they input their PRC identity card information and bank account information. The funds they invest over our platform are deposited into a custody account managed by our custodian bank.

Stage 2: Verification and Credit Assessment
 
We also supplement our review of borrower's application with data from a number of internal and external sources, including the following:
 

· | historical credit data accumulated through our online platform; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | personal identity information maintained by an organization operated under the Ministry of Public Security (the “MPS”); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | personal credit information maintained by an organization operated under the PBOC; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | online databases on court order, judgment and enforcement operated by China Supreme People’s Court; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | online data from internet or wireless service providers, including social network information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | third-party credit check services; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fraud “blacklists” and databases. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This data is then aggregated and used to verify an applicant's identity, for possible fraud detection and for assessment and determination of creditworthiness.
 
Stage 3: Anti-Fraud and Decisioning
 
In order to efficiently screen borrower applicants, we have designed an initial qualification phase to review the basic information regarding a prospective borrower that has been submitted with his application and gathered by us from available sources. After an initial check is performed, the prospective borrower's loan application either proceeds to the next phase of the application process or the prospective borrower is notified of the decision to decline the application.
 
As part of the initial qualification process, we will also conduct telephone or in-person interviews with individual borrowers or in the case of SME borrowers, send our on-the-ground team to visit the applicant at their office, to verify borrower identity, credit data as well as collateral properties, if applicable. If needed, we also engage appraisal firms to determine the value of collaterals. Based on initial due diligence, our business development department prepares requisite reports as well as loan requests for submission to our risk management department for further review and verification.
 
If a member of the credit assessment team suspects there may be fraud involved with a particular loan application or determines that additional verification is needed to complete the credit decisioning process, that team member will conduct further due diligence and verification, such as additional phone calls or onsite visits to the applicant and the applicant's employer that is identified in the application.
 
Following our multi-level review, the credit assessment team will either approve the loan as is, approve the loan with one or more modified sets of loan characteristics, or decline the loan application. Unqualified borrowers are notified of the decision to decline their applications for failing to meet minimum requirements. Qualified borrowers proceed directly to the approval, listing and funding stage.
 
Stage 4: Approval, Listing and Funding
 
Once a loan application is approved, we enter into a loan agreement with respect to borrowers. The loan agreements are between a borrower, investor(s) who fund the borrower's loan and our platform. Upon a borrower's acceptance of the loan documents, the loan is then listed on our platform for investors to view. Once a loan is listed on our platform, investors may then subscribe to the loan using our automated or self-directed investing tools. We enter into a finance intermediary service contract with each borrower prior to the disbursement of the loan proceeds. The contract provides for the services fees we will charge the borrower to facilitate the loan transaction on our platform as well as the rights and obligations of each party in the transaction.
 
Once a loan is fully subscribed, funds are then drawn from a custody account and disbursed to the borrower.

Stage 5: Servicing and Collections
 
We provide payment reminder services through text messages or phone calls one week before payment dates. For loans with a term of 30 days or shorter, borrowers repay interest and principle upon maturity. For loans with a term of longer than 30 days, borrowers pay interest on a monthly basis.
 
We are generally not involved in the collection process after a loan is delinquent. Upon any of these events, the investors may sell defaulted loans to third party asset companies. They may also initiate legal action against the borrowers in default. We only become involved in the legal action when a lender engages us to assist the lender in a legal action initiated upon a default. Since there have not been any defaulted loans on our platform as of the date of this Report, our collection process has not been tested in practice.
 
Risk Management
 
Our Loan Assessment Committee and Risk Management Division
 
We have a loan assessment committee, comprised of five individuals: director of operation, director of risk management, chief compliance officer, chief executive officer and independent review officer. Based on the recommendation of our operation and risk management teams, each application received through our platform is submitted to our loan assessment committee for final review and decision.
 
To approve a loan, our loan assessment committee must reach a consensus and the independent review officer has the authority to veto the decision of other committee members. In the year ended March 31, 2019, approximately 90.76% of the loan applications submitted to our loan assessment committee were approved.
 
We also have an independent risk management division, responsible for establishment and maintenance of risk management systems, evaluation and assessment of risks in operation, documentation, and completion of risk analysis reports etc.
 
Fraud Detection
 
Our fraud detection system is part of our larger risk management system. The system identifies and rejects potential borrower applications. Our system combines offline verification and the use of third-party credit services. Our offline verification activities involve members of our credit assessment team speaking with potential borrowers and their third-party references to inquire after any inconsistencies in a loan application. We also utilize government agency's open database to check their identity card numbers against known criminals and third party companies' credit information on potential borrowers. We maintain a blacklist of applicants after detecting any fraudulent borrowers.
Investor Protection
 
We emphasize investor protection through all stages of a transaction including but not limited to implementing strict risk management measures to assess and verify borrowers’ creditworthiness and monitoring borrowers' payment status. With all these efforts, we have not had any defaulted loan since the launch of our platform.
 
We also strike to follow the best industry practice to protect our investors. For example, we have engaged XW Bank to provide fund depository services for our platform and assume fund depository functions including settlement, accounting and safeguarding online lending capital. In addition, we have obtained the Level III Certification of Information System Security issued by the MPS.

Our Technology
 
We believe our technology platform is a competitive advantage and an important reason that borrowers and investors utilize our platform. Key features of our technology platform include:

• | Mobile applications. We have developed different user-friendly mobile applications for borrowers and investors, which enable borrowers, Creditor Partners and investors to access our platform at any time or location. Approximately 85.13% of investments were facilitated through our mobile application during the year ended March 31, 2019. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fraud detection. We use a combination of current and historical data obtained during the application process, third-party data and sophisticated analytical tools to help determine an application's fraud risk. High risk applications are subject to further investigation. In case where fraud is confirmed, the application is cancelled, and we identify and flag characteristics of the loan to help refine our fraud detection efforts. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable platform. Our platform is built on a distributed, load-balanced computing infrastructure, which is both highly scalable and reliable. The infrastructure can be expanded easily as data storage requirements and user visits increase. We utilize a unified platform, which administrates all systems and servers and can reconfigure or redeploy systems or servers automatically whenever needed. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data security. Our network is configured with multiple layers of security to isolate our databases from unauthorized access and we use sophisticated security protocols for communication among applications. To prevent unauthorized access to our system we utilize a system of firewalls and also maintain a perimeter network, or a demilitarized zone, to separate our external-facing services from our internal systems. Our entire website and public and private application programming interfaces use the Secure Sockets Layer networking protocol. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stability. Our systems infrastructure is hosted in cloud based data centers in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. We have multiple layers of redundancy to ensure the reliability of our network. We also have a working data redundancy model with comprehensive backups of our databases and our development environment conducted every day.

Competition
 
The automobile financing industry in China is large and evolving. According to Didi, there were approximately 300 automobile financing and leasing companies that have established business relationships with Didi in Chengdu City as of June 2019. We face significant competition primarily from companies that operate in Chengdu, such as Chengdu Jingtengjian Business Consulting Co., Ltd., FAW Huidi Automotive Technology Co., Ltd. and Guobang (Chengdu) Financing and Leasing Co., Ltd.
 
The online P2P lending industry is competitive in China. According to Wangdaizhijia, as of March 31, 2019, there were 959 online P2P lending platforms that were in operation in China and 20 platforms in Sichuan, the province in which we primarily conduct our online P2P lending business. Our competitors in Sichuan include Jinding Wealth and Chengdu Hongxue Jinxin Business Consulting Co., Ltd. We also compete nationwide with other online P2P lending platforms, as well as traditional financial institutions, which may have a larger investor and borrower base and substantial financial resources.
 
We also compete with other financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or both. With respect to borrowers, we compete with other internet finance marketplaces and traditional financial institutions, such as consumer finance business units in commercial banks, credit card issuers and other consumer finance companies. With respect to investors, we primarily compete with other investment products and asset classes, such as equities, bonds, investment trust products, bank savings accounts and real estate.

This section sets forth a summary of the most significant rules and regulations that affect our business activities in China or the rights of our stockholders to receive dividends and other distributions from us.
 
Regulations Related to Ride-Hailing Services
 
In order to manage the rapidly growing ride-hailing service market and control relevant risks, on July 28, 2016, seven ministries and commissions, including the Ministry of Transport, jointly promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Taxi Booking Business Operations and Services, which legalizes ride-hailing services such as Didi and requires the ride-hailing services to meet the requirements set out by the Interim Measures and obtain requisite service licenses. 
 
On November 5, 2016, the Municipal Communications Commission of Chengdu City and a number of municipal departments jointly issued the Implementation Rules for the Administration of Taxi Management Services for Chengdu Network. On August 10, 2017, the Transportation Commission of Chengdu further issued guidelines on compliance requirements for ride-hailing businesses, including Working Process for the Online Appointment of Taxi Drivers Qualification Examination and Issuance and Online Appointment Taxi Transportation Certificate Issuance Process. According to these regulations and guidelines, three licenses or certificates are required for operating the ride-hailing business: (1) the ride-hailing service platform such as Didi is required to obtain the online reservation taxi operating license; (2) the automobiles used for online ride-hailing are required to obtain the online reservation taxi transport certificate (the “automobile certificate”); (3) the drivers are required obtain the online reservation taxi driver's license (the “driver’s license”).
 
Without requisite automobile certificate or driver’s license, ride-hailing drivers may be suspended from providing ride-hailing services, their illegal income may be confiscated and they may be subject to fines amounting to RMB5,000 (US$730) to RMB30,000 (US$4,370) for each offense.
 
Regulations Related to Financial Leasing
 
In September 2013, the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM”) issued the Administration Measures of Supervision on Financing Lease Enterprises (the “Leasing Measures”), to regulate and administer the business operations of financial leasing enterprises. According to the Leasing Measures, financial leasing enterprises are allowed to carry out financial leasing businesses in such forms as direct lease, sublease, sale- and-lease-back, leveraged lease, entrusted lease and joint lease in accordance with the provisions of relevant laws, regulations and rules. However, the Leasing Measures prohibit financial leasing enterprises from engaging in financial businesses such as accepting deposits, and providing loans or entrusted loans. Without the approval from relevant authorities, financial leasing enterprises shall not engage in inter-bank borrowing and other businesses. In addition, financial leasing enterprises are prohibited from carrying out illegal fund-raising activities in the name of financial leases. The Leasing Measures require financial leasing enterprises to establish and improve their financial and internal risk control systems, and a financial leasing enterprise’s risk assets may not exceed ten times that of its total net assets.
Regulations Related to the Marketplace Lending Industry
  
In July 2015, ten PRC central government ministries and regulators, including the PBOC, China Banking Regulatory Commission (the “CBRC”), the Ministry of Finance, the MPS and the Cyberspace Administration of China, together released the Guidelines on Promoting Healthy Growth of Internet Finance (the “Guidelines”), which identified the CBRC as the supervisory regulator for the online lending industry. According to the Guidelines, online marketplace lending platforms shall only serve as intermediaries to provide information services to borrowers and investors, and shall not provide credit enhancement services or illegally conduct fundraising. The Guidelines also outlined certain regulatory propositions, which would require Internet finance companies, including marketplace lending platforms, to (i) complete website registration procedures with the administrative departments overseeing telecommunications; (ii) use banking financial institutions' depository accounts to hold lending capital, and engage an independent auditor to audit such accounts and publish audit results to customers; (iii) improve the disclosure of operational and financial information, provide sufficient risk disclosure, and set up thresholds for qualified investors to provide better protections to investors; (iv) enhance online security management to protect customers' personal and transactional information; and (v) take measures against anti-money laundering and other financial crimes.

Effective as of September 1, 2015, the Provisions of the Supreme People’s Court on Application of Laws to the Hearing of Private Lending Cases (the “Provisions on Private Lending Cases”) define private lending as financings between natural persons, legal persons or other organizations. The Provisions set forth that private lending contracts will be upheld as invalid under the circumstance that (i) relending of funds to a borrower that knew or should have known that the funds were fraudulently obtained from a financial institution; (ii) relending of funds to a borrower that knew or should have known that the funds were borrowed from other enterprises or raised by the company's employees; (iii) lending of funds to a borrower wherein the investor knew or should have known that the borrower intended to use the borrowed funds for illegal or criminal purposes; (iv) violations of public orders or good morals; or (v) violations of mandatory provisions of laws or administrative regulations.
 
 According to the Provisions on Private Lending Cases (i) when the interest rate agreed between the borrower and investor does not exceed an annual interest rate of 24%, the People's Court will uphold the interest rate charged by the investor, and (ii) when the interest rate agreed between the borrower and investor exceeds an annual interest rate of 36%, the portion in excess of 36% is void and the People's Court will uphold the borrower's claim for return of the excess portion to the borrower. For loans with interest rates per annum between 24% and 36%, if the interest on the loans has already been paid to the investor, and so long as such payment has not damaged the interest of the state, the community or any third parties, the courts will likely not enforce the borrower's demand for the return of such interest payment. If an interest rate for overdue payments is not agreed to before lending, the interest rate on overdue payments is permitted up to the interest rate for the loan. If neither the interest rate for the loan nor the interest rate for overdue payments have been agreed to, overdue payments are permitted to have an interest rate of 6%.
 
In August 2016, the CBRC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (the “MIIT”), the MPS and the State Internet Information Office jointly promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Business Activities of Online Lending Information Intermediaries. Apart from what had already been emphasized in the Guidelines and other previously released guidance, the Interim Measures include (i) general principles; (ii) filing administration; (iii) business rules and risk management guidelines; (iv) protection measures for investors and borrowers; (v) rules on information disclosure; (vi) supervision and administrative mechanisms; and (vii) legal liabilities.
 
Under the general principles and filing administration sections, the Interim Measures provide that online lending intermediaries shall not engage in credit enhancement services, direct or indirect cash concentration or illegal fundraising. The sections also stipulate a supervisory system and list the administrative responsibilities of different supervisory authorities, including the CBRC and its local counterpart and local financial regulators. Furthermore, these sections require online lending intermediaries to file with the local financial regulators, to apply for relevant telecommunications business licenses thereafter in accordance with the provisions of the relevant telecommunications authorities and to include serving as an Internet lending information intermediary in its business scope.
 
Under the business rules and risk management guidelines section, the Interim Measures stipulate that online lending intermediaries shall not engage in or be commissioned to engage in thirteen prohibited activities, including: (i) directly or indirectly financing its own projects; (ii) directly or indirectly receiving or collecting lenders' funds; (iii) directly or indirectly offering guarantees to lenders or guaranteeing principal and interest payments; (iv) commissioning or authorizing a third party to advertise or promote financing projects at any physical locations other than through electronic channels such as the Internet and mobile phones; (v) providing loans (unless otherwise permitted by laws and regulations); (vi) dividing the term of financing projects; (vii) offering its own wealth management products or other financial products to raise funds or act as a proxy in the selling of banks' wealth management products, brokers’ asset management products, funds, insurance or trust products; (viii) providing services similar to asset-based securitization services or conducting credit assignment activities in the form of asset packaging, asset securitization, asset trusts or fund shares; (ix) mixing with, bundling with or acting as a proxy in relation to investment, sales agent and brokerage services of other businesses (unless permitted by laws and regulations); (x) fabricating or exaggerating the authenticity or earnings outlook of a financing project, concealing its flaws and risks, falsely advertising or promoting a project with intentional ambiguity or other deceptive means, or spreading false or incomplete information to damage the commercial reputation of others, or to mislead lenders or borrowers; (xi) providing intermediary services for loans used to invest in high-risk financing projects such as stocks, over-the-counter margin financing, futures contracts, structured products and other derivatives; (xii) operating equity-based crowd-funding; and (xiii) other activities prohibited by laws and regulations. The Interim Measures, under the business rules and risk management section, also stipulate specific obligations or business principles of online lending intermediaries, including but not limited to online dispute resolution services, examination and verification functions, anti-fraud measures, risk education and training, information reporting, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, systems, facilities and technologies, service fees, electronic signatures and loan management. In addition, the Interim Measures stipulate that online lending intermediaries shall not operate businesses other than risk management and necessary business processes such as information collection and confirmation, post-loan tracking and pledge management in accordance with online-lending regulations, via offline physical locations. Furthermore, the Interim Measures provide that online lending intermediaries shall, based on their risk management capabilities, set upper limits on the loan balance of a single borrower borrowing both from one online lending intermediary and from all online lending intermediaries. In the case of natural persons, this limit shall not be more than RMB 200,000 (US$30,756) for one online lending intermediary and not more than RMB 1 million (US$153,782) in total from all platforms, while the limit for a legal person or organization shall not be more than RMB 1 million for one online lending intermediary and not more than RMB 5 million (US$768,911) in total from all platforms.

In the protection for investors and borrowers section, the Interim Measures require that online lending intermediaries (i) separate their own capital from funds received from lenders and borrowers and (ii) select a qualified banking financial institution as their funding depository institution, which shall perform depository and administration responsibilities as required. In the remaining sections, the Interim Measures provide for other miscellaneous requirements for online lending intermediaries, including but not limited to, risk assessment and disclosure, auditing and authentication, industry association, reporting obligations, information security and disclosure and legal liabilities. Online lending intermediaries established prior to the effectiveness of the Interim Measures have a transition period of twelve months to rectify any activities that are non-compliant with the Interim Measures, except with respect to criminal activity, which must be terminated immediately.
 
In October 2016, several regulations on Internet finance were publicly announced, including but not limited to, the Notice of the General Office of the State Council on the Issuance of Special Rectification Implementation Plan regarding Internet Finance, Special Rectification Implementation Plan regarding Online Lending Risks, Special Rectification Implementation Plan for Risks of Asset Management Business through the Internet and Trans-subject Business, Special Rectification Implementation Plan for Risks regarding Non-Bank Payment Institutions, Special Rectification Implementation Plan for Risks of Internet Financing Advertising and Financial Activities in the form of financial investment (together the “Special Rectification Implementation Plans”). The Special Rectification Implementation Plans emphasize principles and rules in related to Internet finance regulations, and stipulate that (i) “look-through” supervision method shall be adopted, and (ii) companies in the same group that hold a number of financial business qualifications shall not violate rules of related party transactions and other related business regulations.
 
In November 2016, the CBRC, the MIIT and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), jointly issued the Guidance to the Administration of Filling and Registration of Online Lending Information Intermediaries (the “Guidance of Administration”), which provides the general filing rules for online lending intermediaries, and delegates the filing authority to local financial authorities. The Guidance of Administration require that online lending intermediaries apply for registration with local financial regulators. Under the general filing procedures for online lending intermediaries which had already been established and operated prior to the promulgation of the Guidance of Administration, before an filing application is submitted to local financial regulators, the online lending intermediaries may be required to: (i) rectify any breach of applicable regulations as required by local financial regulators; and (ii) apply to the SAIC to amend or register such entity's the business scope.
 
The CBRC also authorizes local financial regulators to make detailed implementation rules regarding filing procedures.

In February 2017, the CBRC released the Guidance to Regulate Funds Depositories for Online Lending Intermediaries (the “Depository Guidance”). The Depository Guidance defines depositories as commercial banks that provide online lending fund depository services, and stipulates that the depositories shall not be engaged in offering any guarantee, including: (i) offering guarantees for lending transaction activities conducted by online lending intermediaries, or undertaking any liability for breach of contract related to such activities; (ii) offering guarantees to lenders, guarantying principal and earnings or bearing the risks associated with fund lending operations for lenders.
 
Apart from the requirements set forth in the Interim Measures and the Guidance of Administration, the Depository Guidance imposes certain responsibilities on online lending intermediaries, including requiring them to enter into fund depository agreements with only one commercial bank to provide fund depository services, organize independent auditing on funds depository accounts of borrowers and investors and various other services. The Depository Guidance also provides that online lending intermediaries permitted to develop an online lending fund depository business shall satisfy certain conditions, including: (i) completing registration, filing records and obtaining a business license from the SAIC; (ii) filing records with the local financial regulator; and (iii) applying for a corresponding value-added telecommunications business license pursuant to the relevant telecommunication authorities. The Depository Guidance also requires online lending intermediaries to perform various obligations, and prohibits them advertising their services with the information of their depository except for in accordance with necessary exposure requirements, the interpretation and applicability of which is unclear, as well as oversight requirements. The Depository Guidance also raises other business standards and miscellaneous requirements for depositories and online lending intermediaries as well. Online lending intermediaries and commercial banks conducting the online depository services prior to the effectiveness of the Depository Guidance have a six-month grace period to rectify any activities not in compliance with the Depository Guidance.
 
Some elements of our platform may not currently be operating in full compliance with the Depository Guidelines, the rules proposed by the Interim Measures and other principles that have been announced in recent years. Moreover, the Interim Measures also stipulated a 12-month transition period from the time of its effectiveness for online lending intermediaries to adjust their business models. See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Our operations may need to be modified to comply with existing and future requirements set forth by the CBRC or laws or regulations promulgated by other PRC authorities regulating the marketplace lending industry in China.”
 
In addition, on April 7, 2017, the CBRC issued the Guideline of Risk Prevention and Control of Banking Industry, which prohibits online lending intermediaries from (i) approaching potential borrowers that are incapable of repaying or (ii) offering Online Lending Services to college students under the age of 18.
 
In December 2017, the Online Lending Rectification Office issued the Notice on the Rectification and Inspection Acceptance of Risk of Online Lending Intermediaries (“Circular 57”), providing further clarification on several matters in connection with the rectification and record-filing of online lending information intermediaries, including, among other things:
 

• | Requirements relating to risk reserve funds. The online lending information intermediaries shall discontinue setting aside additional funds as risk reserve funds or originating new risk reserve funds. In addition, the existing balance of risk reserve funds shall be gradually reduced. Moreover, online lending information intermediaries are prohibited from promoting their services by publicizing the risk reserve funds, and authorities shall actively encourage the online lending information intermediaries to seek third parties to provide lenders with alternate means of investors' protection, including third-party guarantee arrangements. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requirements relating to assignment of debt. Low frequency assignment of debts between lenders shall be deemed as compliance. However, providing services similar to asset-based securitization services or conducting credit assignment activities in the form of asset packaging, asset securitization, asset trusts or fund shares shall be deemed as incompliance; “super lender” mode, which the senior manager or affiliated person of online lending information intermediaries, under the authorization of the platform, concluding loan agreements with the borrower and extending loans directly to the borrower and then release a product equaling to the amount of the loan on the platform, transferring the creditor's right to the actual lender, will be deemed as incompliance.

• | Requirements to qualify for record-filing. Circular 57 sets forth certain requirements which an online lending intermediary shall not be in breach before it can qualify for the record-filing, including: (i) an online lending intermediary may not conduct the “thirteen prohibited actions” or exceed the individual lending amount limit after August 24, 2016, and shall gradually reduce the balance; (ii) an online lending intermediary which has participated in businesses of the real estate mortgage, campus loan or “cash loan,” is required to suspend the new loan origination and the outstanding balance of the abovementioned loans shall be gradually reduced within a certain timetable as required under the CBRC Circular 26 and Circular 141 (as defined below); and (iii) the online lending intermediaries are required to set up custody accounts with qualified banks that have passed certain testing and evaluation procedures run by the National Online Lending Rectification Office to hold customer funds.

In December 2017, the Internet Finance Rectification Office and the Online Lending Rectification Office jointly issued the Notice on Regulating and Rectifying “Cash Loan” Business (the “Circular 141”), outlining general requirements on the “cash loan” business conducted by network microcredit companies, banking financial institutions and online lending information intermediaries. Circular 141 specifies the features of “cash loans” as not relying on consumption scenarios, with no specified use of loan proceeds, no qualification requirement on customers and unsecured etc. Circular 141 sets forth several general requirements with respect to “cash loan” business, including, without limitation: (i) no organizations or individuals may conduct the lending business without obtaining approvals for the lending business; (ii) the aggregated borrowing costs of borrowers charged by institutions in the forms of interest and various fees should be annualized and subject to the limit on interest rate of private lending set forth in the Private Lending Judicial Interpretations issued by the Supreme People’s Court; (iii) all relevant institutions shall follow the “know-your-customer” principle and prudentially assess and determine the borrower's eligibility, credit limit and cooling-off period, etc. Loans to any borrower without income sources are prohibited; and (iv) all relevant institutions shall enhance the internal risk control and prudentially use the “data-driven” risk management model.
 
In additions, Circular 141 emphasizes several requirements on the online lending information intermediaries. For instance, such intermediaries are prohibited from facilitating any loans to students or other persons without repayment source or repayment capacity, or loans with no designated use of proceeds. Also, such intermediaries are not permitted to deduct interest, handling fee, management fee or deposit from the principal of loans provided to the borrowers in advance.
 
Any violation of Circular 141 may result in penalties, including but not limited to suspension of operation, orders to make rectification, condemnation, revocation of license, order to cease business operation, and criminal liabilities.
 
On December 8, 2017, the Office of the Leading Group for the Special Campaign against Peer-to-peer Lending Risks released Circular 57. Circular 57 requires local financial regulator, local CBRC, the People’s Bank local branch, local public security, local communication administrative department and local Administration for Industry and Commerce (“AIC”) to jointly inspect and accept whether an internet lending information intermediary or P2P company complies with the Interim Measures. The P2P company can only be filed records (“P2P Filing”) with the local financial regulator after receiving acceptance certificate or document issued jointly by local financial regulator and local CBRC. Normally, the P2P Filing should be completed before April 2018 according to the Circular 57. Circular 57 forbids several credit assignment models, including: (i) providing asset securitization services or transfer creditor’s rights in form of packaged assets, securitized assets, trust assets or fund shares; (ii) certain credit transfer from related individual party of the P2P company to the lender on the platform; and (iii) using credit right from the peer-to-peer lending platform as a pledge to borrow money from other lenders. In accordance with Circular 57, online lending marketplaces shall optimize their business portfolios continuously and manage the scale of their businesses. Marketplaces that have received rectification notices shall ensure steady decrease of the balance of non-compliant business on these marketplaces and shall not engage in any new non-compliant operations.

On August 13, 2018, the Office of the Leading Group for the Special Campaign against Peer-to-peer Lending Risks issued the Notice on Conducting Compliance Inspection on P2P Lending Platforms, or the Notice on Compliance Inspection, which requires that P2P lending platforms, local internet finance associations and relevant governmental authorities conduct compliance inspections based on a checklist of 108 compliance criteria and that such inspections shall be completed by December 31, 2018. The Notice on Compliance Inspection further states that only P2P lending platforms which pass the compliance check and satisfy a period of operations and tests may apply for filing.
 
In January 2019, the Office of the Lending Group for the Special Campaign against Internet Financial Risks and the Office of the Special Campaign against Peer-to-peer Lending Risks issued Circular 175. according to Circular 175, except for large-scale peer-to-peer direct lending marketplaces that have not demonstrated any high-risk characteristics, which are generally referred to as Normal Marketplaces, other marketplaces, including shell companies with no substantive operation, small-scale marketplaces, marketplaces with high risks and marketplaces on which investors are not fully repaid or that are otherwise unable to operate their businesses, shall exit the peer-to-peer lending industry or cease operation. Normal Marketplaces shall cease operating businesses that are not in compliance with laws and regulations. Circular 175 also encourages certain Normal Marketplaces to convert into other types of online financing institutions such as online small loan companies or loan facilitation platforms. In accordance with Circular 175, Normal Marketplaces shall strictly manage the scale of its business and number of investors, follow the requirements of Dual Decrease and report relevant data to competent government agencies. According to Circular 175, the overarching objective of Circular 175 is for PRC government agencies to effect orderly exits of certain peer-to-peer direct lending marketplaces without inducing systematic risk in the financial system or causing significant social turbulence until only those marketplaces that are strictly in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations remain in operation in the peer-to-peer direct lending industry.
 
Regulations Related to Illegal Fundraising
 
PRC laws and regulations prohibit persons and companies from raising funds through advertising to the public a promise to repay premium or interest payments over time through payments in cash or in kind except with the prior approval of the applicable government authorities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in penalties imposed by the PBOC, the AIC and other governmental authorities and can lead to civil or criminal lawsuits.
 
The Measures for the Banning of Illegal Financial Institutions and Illegal Financial Business Operations, promulgated by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China (“State Council”) in July 1998, and amended on January 2011, and the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning the Penalty on Illegal Fund-Raising, issued by the General Office of the State Council in July 2007, explicitly prohibit illegal public fund-raising. The main features of illegal public fund-raising include: (i) illegally soliciting and raising funds from the general public by means of issuing stocks, bonds, lotteries or other securities without obtaining the approval of relevant authorities, (ii) promising a return of interest or profits or investment returns in cash, properties or other forms within a specified period of time, and (iii) using a legitimate form to disguise the unlawful purpose.

The Supreme People’s Court promulgated the Judicial Interpretations to Issues Concerning Applications of Laws for Trial of Criminal Cases on Illegal Fund-Raising (the “Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations”), which became effective in January 4, 2011, to clarify the criminal charges and punishments regarding illegal public fund-raising. The Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations provide that a public fund-raising will constitute a criminal offense of “illegally soliciting deposits from the public” under the PRC Criminal Law, if it meets all of the following criteria: (i) the fund-raising has not been approved by relevant authorities or is concealed under the disguise of legitimate acts; (ii) the fund-raising employs general solicitation or advertising such as social media, promotion meetings, leafleting and short messaging service advertising; (iii) the fundraiser promises to repay, after a specified period of time, the capital and interests, or investment returns in cash, properties in kind or other payment forms; and (iv) the fund-raising targets the general public as opposed to specific individuals. An illegal fund-raising activity will be fined or prosecuted in the event that it constitutes a criminal offense. Pursuant to the Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations, an offender that is an entity will be subject to criminal liabilities, if it illegally solicits deposits from the general public or illegally solicits deposits in disguised form (i) with the amount of deposits involved exceeding RMB1,000,000, (ii) with over 150 fund-raising targets involved, or (iii) with the direct economic loss caused to fund-raising targets exceeding RMB500,000, or (iv) the illegal fund-raising activities have caused baneful influences to the public or have led to other severe consequences. An individual offender is also subject to criminal liabilities but with lower thresholds. The Measures for the Banning of Illegal Financial Institutions and Illegal Financial Business Operations also prohibits facilitating loans to the public without the approval of the PBOC.
 
Our platform only acts as an information service provider in the facilitation of loans between borrowers and investors, our platform has not been subject to any fines or other penalties under any PRC laws and regulations that prohibit illegal fundraising. In this regard, as advised by our PRC counsel, the business operation of our platform does not violate the current existing PRC laws and regulations prohibiting illegal fundraising. Nevertheless, uncertainties exist with respect to the PBOC, AIC and other governmental authorities' interpretations of the fundraising-related laws and regulations. While our agreements with investors require investors to guarantee the legality of all funds investors put on our platform, we do not verify the source of investors’ funds separately, and therefore, to the extent that investors' funds are obtained through illegal fundraising, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of illegal fundraising. In addition, while our loan agreements contain provisions that require borrowers to use the proceeds for purposes listed in their loan applications, we do not monitor the borrowers' use of funds on an on-going basis, and therefore, to the extent that borrowers use proceeds from the loans for illegal activities, we may be negligently liable as a facilitator of an illegal use. Although we have designed and implemented procedures to identify and eliminate instances of fraudulent conduct on our platform, as the number of borrowers and investors on our platform increases, we may not be able to identify all fraudulent conduct that may violate illegal fundraising laws and regulations.
 
Regulations Related to Value-Added Telecommunication Business Certificates and Foreign Investment Restrictions
 
PRC regulations impose sanctions for engaging in Internet information services of a commercial nature without having obtained an ICP certificate or engaging in the operation of online data processing and transaction processing (“ODPTP”) without having obtained an ODPTP certificate. These sanctions include corrective orders and warnings from the PRC communication administration authority, fines and confiscation of illegal gains and, in the case of significant infringements, the websites may be ordered to close. Nevertheless, the PRC regulatory authorities' enforcement of such regulations in the context of online lending platforms remains unclear.
 
According to the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunication Enterprises, the ratio of investment by foreign investors in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise that engages in the operation of a value-added telecommunication business shall not exceed 50%. The Circular of Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Concerning Lifting Restrictions on the Proportion of Foreign Equity in Online Data Processing and Transaction Processing Business (E-commerce) (the “Circular 196”), which was promulgated on June 19, 2015, provides that foreign investors are permitted to invest up to 100% of the registered capital in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise engaging in the operation of online data processing and transaction processing (E-commerce). However, foreign investors are only permitted to invest up to 50% of the registered capital in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise that engages in the operation of Internet information services. Under either circumstance, the largest foreign investor will be required to have a satisfactory business track record and operational experience in the value-added telecommunications business.
 
While Circular 196 permits foreign ownership, in whole or in part, of online data and deal processing businesses (E-commerce), a sub-set of value-added telecommunications services, it is not clear whether our online lending platform will be deemed as online data and deal processing. See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — We may be required to obtain a value-added telecommunication business certificate and be subject to foreign investment restrictions.”

Regulations Related to Internet Advertising
 
The Interim Measures for Administration of Internet Advertising (the “Internet Advertising Measures”), were adopted by the SAIC and became effective on September 1, 2016. The Internet Advertising Measures regulate Internet advertising activities. According to the Internet Advertising Measures, Internet advertisers are responsible for the authenticity of the content of advertisements. The identity, administrative license, cited information and other certificates that advertisers are required to obtain in publishing Internet advertisements shall be true and valid. Internet advertisements shall be distinguishable and prominently marked as “advertisements” in order to enable consumers to identify them as advertisements. Publishing and circulating advertisements through the Internet shall not affect the normal use of the Internet by users. It is not allowed to induce users to click on the content of advertisements by any fraudulent means, or to attach advertisements or advertising links in the emails without permission. The Internet Advertising Measures also impose several restrictions on the forms of advertisements and activities used in advertising. “Internet advertising” as defined in the Internet Advertising Measures refers to commercial advertisements that directly or indirectly promote goods or services through websites, web pages, Internet applications or other Internet media in various forms, including texts, pictures, audio clips and videos. Where Internet advertisements are not identifiable and marked as “advertisements”, a fine of not more than RMB 100,000 (US$15,378) may be imposed in accordance with Advertising Law. A fine ranging from RMB 5,000 (US$769) to RMB 30,000 (US$4,613) may be imposed for any failure to provide a prominently marked “CLOSE” button to ensure “one-click closure”. Advertisers who induce users to click on the content of advertisements by fraudulent means or without permission, attach advertisements or advertising links in the emails shall be imposed a fine ranging from RMB 10,000 (US$1,538) to RMB 30,000 (US$4,613). Our marketplace is in the process of complying with the new Internet Advertising Measures during our advertising activities.
Regulations Related to Information Security and Confidentiality of User Information
 
Internet activities in China are regulated and restricted by the PRC government and are subject to criminal penalties under the Decision Regarding the Protection of Internet Security.
 
The MPS has promulgated measures that prohibit use of the Internet in ways that, among other things, result in leaks of government secrets or the spread of socially destabilizing content. The MPS and its local counterparts have authority to supervise and inspect domestic websites to carry out its measures. Internet information service providers that violate these measures may have their licenses revoked and their websites shut down.
 
On June 22, 2007, the MPS, the State Secrecy Administration and other relevant authorities jointly issued the Administrative Measures for the Hierarchical Protection of Information Security, which divides information systems into five categories and requires the operators of information systems ranking above Grade II to file an application with the local Bureau of Public Security within 30 days of the date of its security protection grade determination or since its operation. The Company completed its registration with the local Bureau of Public Security in April, 2017.
 
The PRC government regulates the security and confidentiality of Internet users’ information. The Administrative Measures on Internet Information Service, the Regulations on Technical Measures of Internet Security Protection and the Provisions on Protecting Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet Users, which were issued on July 16, 2013 by the MIIT, set forth strict requirements to protect personal information of Internet users and require Internet information service providers to maintain adequate systems to protect the security of such information. Personal information collected must be used only in connection with the services provided by the Internet information service provider. Moreover, the Rules for Regulating the Order in the Market for Internet Information Service also protect Internet users’ personal information by (i) prohibiting Internet information service providers from unauthorized collection, disclosure or use of their users’ personal information and (ii) requiring Internet information service providers to take measures to safeguard their users' personal information. In December 2012, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Decision on Strengthening Internet Information Protection, which provides that all Internet service providers in China, including Internet information service providers, must require that their users provide identification information before entering into service agreements or providing services.

On November 7, 2016, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress released the Cyber Security Law, which came into effect on June 1, 2017 (“Cyber Security Law”). The Cyber Security Law requires network operators to perform certain functions related to cyber security protection and the strengthening of network information management. For instance, under the Cyber Security Law, network operators of key information infrastructure generally shall, during their operations in the PRC, store the personal information and important data collected and produced within the territory of PRC.
 
On April 11, 2017, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced the Measures for the Security Assessment of Personal Information and Important Data to be Transmitted Abroad (consultation draft) (the “Consultation Draft of Security Assessment Measures”). The Consultation Draft of Security Assessment Measures requires network operators to conduct security assessments and obtain consents from owners of personal information prior to transmitting personal information and other important data abroad. Moreover, under the Consultation Draft of Security Assessment Measures, the network operators are required to apply to the relevant regulatory authorities for security assessments under several circumstances, including but not limited to: (i) if data to be transmitted abroad contains personal information of more than 500,000 users in aggregate; (ii) if the quantity of the data to be transmitted abroad is more than 1,000 gigabytes; (iii) if data to be transmitted abroad contains information regarding nuclear facilities, chemical biology, national defense or military projects, population and health, or relates to large-scale engineering activities, marine environment issues or sensitive geographic information; (iv) if data to be transmitted abroad contains network security information regarding system vulnerabilities or security protection of critical information infrastructure; (v) if key information infrastructure network operators transmit personal information and important data abroad; or (vi) if any other data to be transmitted abroad contains information that might affect national security or public interest and are required to be assessed as determined by the relevant regulatory authorities.
 
Regulations Related to Company Establishment and Foreign Investment
 
The establishment, operation and management of corporate entities in China is governed by the Company Law of the PRC (the “Company Law”). According to the Company Law, companies established in the PRC are either limited liability companies or joint stock limited liability companies. The Company Law applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested companies. The establishment procedures, approval procedures, registered capital requirements, foreign exchange matters, accounting practices, taxation and labor matters of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise are regulated by the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Implementation Regulation of the Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law. According to these regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in the PRC may only pay dividends out of their accumulated profit, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. A PRC company is required to set aside general reserves of at least 10% of its after-tax profit, until the cumulative amount of such reserves reaches 50% of its registered capital unless the provisions of laws regarding foreign investment provide otherwise. In addition, PRC companies may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserves and employee welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. A PRC company may not distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. In September 2016, the National People's Congress Standing Committee published its decision to revise the laws relating to wholly foreign-owned enterprises and other foreign-invested enterprises. Such decision, which became effective on October 1, 2016, changes the “filing or approval” procedure for foreign investments in China such that foreign investments in business sectors not subject to special administrative measures will only be required to complete a filing instead of the existing requirements to apply for approval. The special entry management measures shall be promulgated or approved to be promulgated by the State Council. Pursuant to a notice issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”) and MOFCOM on October 8, 2016, the special entry management measures shall be implemented with reference to the relevant regulations as stipulated in the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment in relation to the restricted foreign investment industries, prohibited foreign investment industries and encouraged foreign investment industries. Pursuant to the Provisional Administrative Measures on Establishment and Modifications Filing for Foreign Investment Enterprises promulgated by MOFCOM on October 8, 2016, establishment and changes of foreign investment enterprises not subject to the approval under the special entry management measures shall be filed with the relevant commerce authorities.

The Provisions on Guiding the Orientation of Foreign Investment and the 2015 revision of the Catalogue of Industries for Guiding Foreign Investment classify foreign investment projects into four categories: encouraged projects, permitted projects, restricted projects and prohibited projects. The purpose of these regulations is to direct foreign investment into certain priority industry sectors and restrict or prohibit investment in other sectors. If the industry sector in which the investment is to occur falls into the encouraged category, foreign investment can be conducted through the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise. If a restricted category, foreign investment may be conducted through the establishment of a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, provided certain requirements are met, and, in some cases, the establishment of a joint venture enterprise is required with varying minimum shareholdings for the Chinese party depending on the particular industry. If a prohibited category, foreign investment of any kind is not allowed. Any industry not falling into any of the encouraged, restricted or prohibited categories is classified as a permitted industry for foreign investment. Our online lending and risk management consulting businesses are classified as permitted foreign investment projects. However, if our online lending platform is required to obtain an ICP certificate (see “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — We may be required to obtain a value-added telecommunication business certificate and be subject to foreign investment restrictions.”), our foreign investment will not be permitted to exceed 50% and the main foreign investor will be required to have a good track record and operational experience in value-added telecommunications businesses.
 
The Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2018 Version) (the “2018 Negative List”), which was promulgated jointly by the MOFCOM and the NDRC on June 28, 2018 and became effective on July 28, 2018, replaced and partly abolished the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment (2017 Revision) regulating the access of foreign investors to China. Foreign investors should refrain from making investing in any of prohibited sectors specified in the 2018 Negative List, and foreign investors are required to obtain the permit for access to other sectors that are listed in the 2018 Negative List but not classified as “prohibited.”
 
On June 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the new Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2019 Version) which will become effective on July 31, 2019 (the “2019 Negative List”) to replace the 2018 Negative List. Neither our Automobile Transaction and Related Services nor our Online Lending Services is listed in 2018 Negative List or 2019 Negative List. However, if we are required to obtain an ICP certificate for our Online Lending Services, we may be subject to foreign investment restrictions which prohibit us from holding more than 50% of our Online Lending Services.
 
According to the Foreign Investment Law, “foreign investment” refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by one or more natural persons, business entities, or otherwise organizations of a foreign country (collectively referred to as “foreign investor”) within China, and the investment activities include the following situations: (i) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, establishes a foreign-invested enterprise within China; (ii) a foreign investor acquires stock shares, equity shares, shares in assets, or other like rights and interests of an enterprise within China; (iii) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, invests in a new project within China; and (iv) investments in other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations, or the State Council.
 
According to the Foreign Investment Law, the State Council will publish or approve to publish the “negative list” for special administrative measures concerning foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested enterprises (“FIEs”), except for those FIEs that operate in industries deemed to be either “restricted” or “prohibited” in the “negative list”. Because the “negative list” has yet to be published, it is unclear whether it will differ from the current Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List). The Foreign Investment Law provides that FIEs operating in foreign restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC governmental authorities. If a foreign investor is found to invest in any prohibited industry in the “negative list”, such foreign investor may be required to, among other aspects, cease its investment activities, dispose of its equity interests or assets within a prescribed time limit and have its income confiscated. If the investment activity of a foreign investor is in breach of any special administrative measure for restrictive access provided for in the “negative list”, the relevant competent department shall order the foreign investor to make corrections and take necessary measures to meet the requirements of the special administrative measure for restrictive access.

Besides, the PRC government will establish a foreign investment information reporting system, according to which foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the competent department for commerce concerned through the enterprise registration system and the enterprise credit information publicity system, and a security review system under which the security review shall be conducted for foreign investment affecting or likely affecting the state security.
 
Furthermore, the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign investment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the Foreign Investment Law.
 
In addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in the PRC, including, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency, its contributions, profits, capital gains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation lawfully acquired, and income from liquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their departments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate rights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs, set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and operation activities of FIEs; except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation shall be made in a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer is prohibited.
 
Regulations Related to Labor and Social Security
 
Pursuant to the PRC Labor Law, the PRC Labor Contract Law and the Implementing Regulations of the Employment Contracts Law, labor relationships between employers and employees must be executed in written form. Wages may not be lower than the local minimum wage. Employers must establish a system for labor safety and sanitation, strictly abide by state standards and provide relevant education to its employees. Employees are also required to work in safe and sanitary conditions.
 
On December 28, 2012, the PRC Labor Contract Law was amended with effect on July 1, 2013 to impose more stringent requirements on labor dispatch. Under such law, dispatched workers are entitled to pay equal to that of full-time employees for equal work, but the number of dispatched workers that an employer hires may not exceed a certain percentage of its total number of employees as determined by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. Additionally, dispatched workers are only permitted to engage in temporary, auxiliary or substitute work. According to the Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch promulgated by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on January 24, 2014, which became effective on March 1, 2014, the number of dispatched workers hired by an employer shall not exceed 10% of the total number of its employees (including both directly hired employees and dispatched workers). The Interim Provisions on Labor Dispatch require employers not in compliance with the PRC Labor Contract Law in this regard to reduce the number of its dispatched workers to below 10% of the total number of its employees prior to March 1, 2016. In addition, an employer is not permitted to hire any new dispatched worker until the number of its dispatched workers has been reduced to below 10% of the total number of its employees.
 
Under PRC laws, rules and regulations, including the Social Insurance Law, the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Funds and the Regulations on the Administration of Housing Accumulation Funds, employers are required to contribute, on behalf of their employees, to a number of social security funds, including funds for basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, occupational injury insurance, maternity leave insurance and housing accumulation funds. These payments are made to local administrative authorities and any employer who fails to contribute may be fined and ordered to pay the deficit amount. See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Failure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.”

Regulations on Intellectual Property
 
The PRC has adopted legislation governing intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks and patents. The PRC is a signatory to major international conventions on intellectual property rights and is subject to the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights as a result of its accession to the World Trade Organization in December 2001.
 
The National People's Congress amended the Copyright Law in 2001 and 2010 to widen the scope of works and rights that are eligible for copyright protection. The amended, the Copyright Law extends copyright protection to Internet activities, products disseminated over the Internet and software products. In addition, there is a voluntary registration system administered by the China Copyright Protection Center. To address copyright infringement related to content posted or transmitted over the Internet, the National Copyright Administration and former Ministry of Information Industry jointly promulgated the Administrative Measures for Copyright Protection Related to the Internet in April 2005. These measures became effective in May 2005.
 
On December 20, 2001, the State Council promulgated the new Regulations on Computer Software Protection, effective from January 1, 2002, and revised in 2013, which are intended to protect the rights and interests of the computer software copyright holders and encourage the development of software industry and information economy. In the PRC, software developed by PRC citizens, legal persons or other organizations is automatically protected immediately after its development, without an application or approval. Software copyrights may be registered with the designated agency and if registered, the certificate of registration issued by the software registration agency will be the primary evidence of the ownership of the copyright and other registered matters. On February 20, 2002, the National Copyright Administration of the PRC introduced the Measures on Computer Software Copyright Registration, which outline the operational procedures for registration of software copyright, as well as registration of software copyright license and transfer contracts. The Copyright Protection Center of China is mandated as the software registration agency.
 
The PRC Trademark Law, adopted in 1982 and revised in 1993, 2001 and 2013 respectively, protects the proprietary rights to registered trademarks. The Trademark Office under the SAIC handles trademark registrations and may grant a term of ten years for registered trademarks, which may be extended for another ten years upon request. Trademark license agreements shall be filed with the Trademark Office for record. In addition, if a registered trademark is recognized as a well-known trademark, the protection of the proprietary right of the trademark holder may reach beyond the specific class of the relevant products or services.
 
The Patent Law of the PRC and its Implementation Rules provide for three types of patents: invention, utility model and design. The duration of a patent right is either 10 years or 20 years from the date of application, depending on the type of patent right.
 
Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, which were most recently amended in August 2008. Payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can usually be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate PRC authorities or banks authorized by appropriate PRC authorities is required where RMB capital is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses.

SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises (“Circular 19”), effective on June 1, 2015, in replacement of SAFE Circular 142 (the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises. According to Circular 19, the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company is regulated such that RMB capital may not be used for the issuance of RMB entrusted loans or the repayment of inter-enterprise loans or the repayment of banks loans that have been transferred to a third party. Although Circular 19 allows RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise to be used for equity investments within the PRC, it also reiterates the principle that RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope. Thus, it is unclear whether SAFE will permit such capital to be used for equity investments in the PRC in actual practice. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account (the “Circular 16”), effective on June 9, 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to non-associated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 or Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties.
 
From 2012, SAFE has promulgated several circulars to substantially amend and simplify the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to these circulars, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, the reinvestment of RMB proceeds by foreign investors in the PRC and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE. In addition, domestic companies are no longer limited to extend cross-border loans to their offshore subsidiaries but are also allowed to provide loans to their offshore parents and affiliates and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces. SAFE also promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in the PRC shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. In February 2015, SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 13, which took effect on June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 13 delegates the power to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with inbound and outbound direct investments under relevant SAFE rules from local branches of SAFE to banks, thereby further simplifying the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investments.
 
On January 26, 2017, SAFE issued the Notice of State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to Further Promote Foreign Exchange Control (the “SAFE Circular 3”), which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.
 
Regulations Relating to Offshore Special Purpose Companies Held by PRC Residents
 
SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident's Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (the “SAFE Circular 37”) in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions.
 
SAFE Circular 37 was issued to replace SAFE Circular 75 (the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles. SAFE further enacted the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Foreign Exchange Management Policies for Direct Investment (the “SAFE Circular 13”) effective from June 1, 2015, which allows PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. However, remedial registration applications made by PRC residents that previously failed to comply with the SAFE Circular 37 continue to fall under the jurisdiction of the relevant local branch of SAFE. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from distributing profits to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.

See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — PRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiaries' ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC law.”
 
SAFE Regulations Relating to Employee Stock Incentive Plans
 
On February 15, 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies (the “Stock Option Rules”), which replaced the Application Procedures of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Ownership Plans or Stock Option Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies issued by SAFE on March 28, 2007. Under the Stock Option Rules and other relevant rules and regulations, PRC residents who participate in a stock incentive plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register with SAFE or its local branches and complete certain other procedures. Participants of a stock incentive plan who are PRC residents must retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the SAFE registration and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plan on behalf of its participants. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options, the purchase and sale of corresponding shares or interests and fund transfers. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect to our share incentive plans if there are any material changes to the share incentive plans, the PRC agent or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. In addition, SAFE Circular 37 provides that PRC residents who participate in a share incentive plan of an overseas unlisted special purpose company may register with SAFE or its local branches before exercising rights. See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Any failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.”
Regulations Related to Tax
 
Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”), which became effective on January 1, 2008, an enterprise established outside the PRC with “de facto management bodies” within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide income. In 2009, the SAT issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprise on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies (the “SAT Circular 82”), which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Further to SAT Circular 82, in 2011, the SAT issued the Administrative Measures for Enterprise Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Resident Enterprises (Trial) (the “SAT Bulletin 45”) to provide more guidance on the implementation of SAT Circular 82.
 
According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be considered a PRC resident enterprise by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its worldwide income only if all of the following conditions are met: (a) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function have their presence mainly in the PRC; (b) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board of directors and shareholders' meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d) more than half of the enterprise's directors or senior management with voting rights habitually reside in the PRC.

Although SAT Circular 82 and SAT Bulletin 45 only apply to offshore-incorporated enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determination criteria set forth therein may reflect the SAT’s general position on how the term “de facto management body” could be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners.
 
The State Administration of Taxation has promulgated several rules and notices to tighten the scrutiny over acquisition transactions in recent years, including the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the “SAT Circular 698”), the Notice on Several Issues Regarding the Income Tax of Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the “SAT Circular 24”) and the Notice on Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises (the “SAT Circular 7”). Pursuant to these rules and notices, if a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC tax resident enterprise, such non-PRC resident transferor must report to the tax authorities at the place where the PRC tax resident enterprise is located and is subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. In addition, if a non-PRC resident enterprise indirectly transfers so-called PRC Taxable Properties, referring to properties of an establishment or a place of business in China, real estate properties in China and equity investments in a PRC tax resident enterprise, by disposition of the equity interests in an overseas non-public holding company without a reasonable commercial purpose and resulting in the avoidance of PRC enterprise income tax, the transfer will be re-characterized as a direct transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties and gains derived from the transfer may be subject to a PRC withholding tax of up to 10%. SAT Circular 7 has listed several factors to be taken into consideration by the tax authorities in determining if an indirect transfer has a reasonable commercial purpose. However, regardless of these factors, an indirect transfer satisfying all the following criteria will be deemed to lack a reasonable commercial purpose and be taxable in the PRC: (i) 75% or more of the equity value of the intermediary enterprise being transferred is derived directly or indirectly from PRC Taxable Properties; (ii) at any time during the one year period before the indirect transfer, 90% or more of the asset value of the intermediary enterprise (excluding cash) is comprised directly or indirectly of investments in the PRC, or 90% or more of its income is derived directly or indirectly from the PRC; (iii) the functions performed and risks assumed by the intermediary enterprise and any of its subsidiaries that directly or indirectly hold the PRC Taxable Properties are limited and are insufficient to prove their economic substance; and (iv) the foreign tax payable on the gain derived from the indirect transfer of the PRC Taxable Properties is lower than the potential PRC tax on the direct transfer of those assets. On the other hand, indirect transfers falling into the scope of the safe harbors under SAT Circular 7 may not be subject to PRC tax. The safe harbors include qualified group restructurings, public market trades and exemptions under tax treaties.
 
Under SAT Circular 7 and other PRC tax regulations, in the case of an indirect transfer, entities or individuals obligated to pay the transfer price to the transferor must act as withholding agents and are required to withhold the PRC tax from the transfer price. If they fail to do so, the seller is required to report and pay the PRC tax to the PRC tax authorities. If neither party complies with the tax payment or withholding obligations under SAT Circular 7, the tax authority may impose penalties such as late payment interest on the seller. In addition, the tax authority may also hold the withholding agents liable and impose a penalty of 50% to 300% of the unpaid tax on them. The penalty imposed on the purchasers may be reduced or waived if the withholding agents have submitted the relevant materials in connection with the indirect transfer to the PRC tax authorities in accordance with SAT Circular 7.
 
Regulations Related to PRC Value-Added Tax 
 In March 2016, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation further promulgated the Notice on Fully Promoting the Pilot Plan for Replacing Business Tax by Value-Added Tax (“VAT”), which became effective on May 1, 2016. Pursuant to the pilot plan and relevant notices, VAT is generally imposed in lieu of business tax in the modern service industries, including the value-added telecommunication services, on a nationwide basis. VAT of a rate of 6% applies to revenue derived from the provision of some modern services. Certain small taxpayers under PRC law are subject to reduced value-added tax at a rate of 3%. Unlike business tax, a taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the modern services provided.

On April 4, 2018, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice on Adjustment of VAT Rates, which came into effect on May 1, 2018. According to the abovementioned notice, the taxable goods previously subject to VAT rates of 17% and 11% respectively become subject to lower VAT rates of 16% and 10% respectively starting from May 1, 2018. Furthermore, according to the Announcement on Relevant Policies for Deepening Value-added Tax Reform jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, the State Administration of Taxation and the General Administration of Customs, which became effective on April 1, 2019, the taxable goods previously subject to VAT rates of 16% and 10% respectively become subject to lower VAT rates of 13% and 9% respectively starting from April 1, 2019.
 
Pursuant to applicable PRC regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of China and the SAT, we are required to pay a VAT at a rate of 6% for our services and 13% for our automobile sales and financial leasing, with respect to revenues derived from the provision of Automobile Transaction and Related Services. All revenues derived from Online Lending Services are subject to the rate of 3% as Sichuan Senmiao is a small taxpayer. A taxpayer is allowed to offset the qualified input VAT paid on taxable purchases against the output VAT chargeable on the revenue from services provided.
 
Regulations Related to Mergers and Acquisitions
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”), promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “M&A Rules”), which became effective on September 8, 2006 and were amended on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules, among other things, require offshore special purpose vehicles formed for overseas listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC domestic enterprises or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published a notice specifying the documents and materials that are required to be submitted for obtaining CSRC approval.
 
The M&A Rules, and other recently adopted regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex. For example, the M&A Rules require that MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise, if (i) any important industry is concerned, (ii) such transaction involves factors that impact or may impact national economic security, or (iii) such transaction will lead to a change in control of a domestic enterprise which holds a famous trademark or PRC time-honored brand. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on August 30, 2007 and effective as of August 1, 2008 requires that transactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by MOFCOM before they can be completed. In addition, on February 3, 2011, the General Office of the State Council promulgated a Notice on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “Circular 6”), which officially established a security review system for mergers and acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors. Further, on August 25, 2011, MOFCOM promulgated the Regulations on Implementation of Security Review System for the Merger and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the “MOFCOM Security Review Regulations”), which became effective on September 1, 2011, to implement Circular 6. Under Circular 6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors having “national defense and security” concerns and mergers and acquisitions by which foreign Investors may acquire the “de facto control” of domestic enterprises with “national security” concerns. Under the MOFCOM Security Review Regulations, MOFCOM will focus on the substance and actual impact of the transaction when deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review. If MOFCOM decides that a specific merger or acquisition is subject to security review, it will submit it to the Inter-Ministerial Panel, an authority established under Circular 6 led by the NDRC and MOFCOM under the leadership of the State Council, to carry out the security review. The regulations prohibit foreign investors from bypassing the security review by structuring transactions through trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements or offshore transactions. There is no explicit provision or official interpretation stating that the merger or acquisition of a company engaged in the marketplace lending business requires security review.

Research and Development
 
With an aim to standardize our transaction process and achieve higher operating efficiency, we are developing an integrated information system for Our Automobile Transaction and Related Services. The system will comprise modules for procurement, qualification assessment, delivery and post-transaction management which covers the whole transaction process. We have completed the development of certain functions such as information entry and delivery which are being tested by us. We expect to complete and launch the system by the end of 2019.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on PRC trademark and trade secret law and confidentiality, invention assignment and non-compete agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. We own 15 software copyrights and six trademarks. We have five trademark applications pending at the PRC Trademark Office. We have also registered numerous domain names, including www.51ruixi.com, www.jklqc.com, www.ihongsen.com and www.senmiaotech.com. The information on our websites is not a part of, or incorporated in, this Report.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. From time to time, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 
In addition, third parties may initiate litigation against us alleging infringement of their proprietary rights or declaring their non-infringement of our intellectual property rights. In the event of a successful claim of infringement and our failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, our business could be harmed. Moreover, even if we are able to license the infringed or similar technology, license fees could be substantial and may adversely affect our results of operations.
 
See “Business — Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Generally — We may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.” and “— We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.”
 
Insurance
 
We obtain accident insurance and commercial liability insurance, which are mandatory, on all the automobiles we purchase for sales or financing and pass on the costs of such insurance to our customers in the sale/financing transaction. We provide social security insurance including pension insurance, unemployment insurance, work-related injury insurance and medical insurance for our employees. We do no maintain any property insurance policies, business interruption insurance or general third-party liability insurance, nor do we maintain product liability insurance or key-man insurance. We consider our insurance coverage to be sufficient for our business operations in China.
Recent Developments
 
June 2019 Registered Direct Offering
 
On June 17, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with certain accredited investors (the “Investors”) in connection with the registered direct public offering (the “June 2019 Offering” ) of 1,781,361 shares (the “Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, for a purchase price of approximately $6,000,000. The Shares were offered at a price of $3.38 per share (the “Share Purchase Price”). On June 21, 2019, we closed the June 2019 Offering. The Shares and the Warrants were issued pursuant to a prospectus supplement filed with the Commission on June 20, 2019 to the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-230397), which was initially filed with the Commission on March 19, 2019, and was declared effective on April 15, 2019. 
 
In connection with the June 2019 Offering, we also issued to the Investors for no consideration, Series A common stock purchase warrants (the “Series A Warrants”) and for nominal consideration, pre-funded Series B common stock purchase warrants (the “Series B Warrants”; and together with the Series A Warrants, the “Warrants”).

The Company is using the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including automobile purchases, the costs of providing leasing and other automobile transaction services, including financial leasing, costs of developing other types of financing businesses, investments in other entities, costs of technology development, costs of new hires, capital expenditures, working capital and the costs of operating as a public company.  At least $500,000 of the proceeds was deposited into an account at a bank in the United States, which proceeds (x) may solely be used to satisfy any reasonable legal, audit, accounting and other professional fees and expenses of the Company and (y) shall not be transferred or used for any other purposes without the prior written consent of certain investors.
 
The Series A Warrants provide for the purchase of up to an aggregate of 1,336,021 shares of common stock. The Series A Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance (the “Series A Initial Exercise Date”), at an exercise price of $3.72 per share (the “Series A Exercise Price”) and will expire on the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Series A Initial Exercise Date. In the event that the Company issues any equity or equity-linked securities at a price lower than the Series A Exercise Price (subject to certain exceptions), the Investors have full ratchet anti-dilution protection. On the six (6)-month anniversary of the Series A Initial Exercise Date, if the average Volume Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) during the ten (10) trading days prior to such anniversary (“New Exercise Price”) is less than the Series A Exercise Price, then the Series A Exercise Price has a one-time price adjustment equal to the New Exercise Price; provided, however, in no event, shall the New Exercise Price be less than $1.50 per share. Subject to standard equity conditions, commencing on the tenth (10th) trading day after Series A Initial Exercise Date, the Company may force the exercise of the Series A Warrants if at any time the VWAP of the common stock exceeds $11.16 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and similar events) for ten (10) consecutive trading days.
 
The Series B Warrants are pre-funded warrants and were issued as a true-up with respect to the Shares. Initially, the Series B Warrants won’t be exercisable for any shares of common stock. In the event that on the fiftieth (50th) day after the closing date (the “Adjustment Measuring Time”), the closing price of the common stock is less than the Share Purchase Price, then the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants shall be adjusted (upward or downward, as applicable) to the greater of (i) zero (0) and (ii) such aggregate number of shares of common stock equal to fifty percent (50%) of the difference of (A) the quotient of (x) the Share Purchase Price divided by (y) the Market Price (as defined the in Purchase Agreement) as of the Adjustment Measuring Time, less (B) the aggregate number of Shares issued to the Investors at the closing (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, share combinations, recapitalizations and similar events). The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants is 1,116,320. The Series B Warrants are exercisable commencing on the first (1st) day of the Adjustment Measuring Time for a period of one (1) year from the issuance of the Series B Warrants. The Series B Warrants have the same exercise price as the Series A Exercise Price. The Series B Warrants have no anti-dilution or reset provisions on the exercise price.
 
The exercise of the Warrants are subject to beneficial ownership limitations such that an Investor may not exercise any Warrant to the extent that such exercise would result in the Investor being the beneficial owner in excess of 4.99% (or, upon election of such Investor, 9.99%), which beneficial ownership limitation may be increased or decreased up to 9.99% upon notice to the Company, provided that any increase in such limitation will not be effective until 61 days following notice to the Company. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d), in no event will the Company issue more than 19.99% of the Company’s total issued and outstanding shares as of June 17, 2019.
 
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement: (a) each of the Investors shall have a 40% right of participation (on a pro-rata basis) in any debt or equity linked financings undertaken by the Company for eighteen (18) months following the closing of the June 2019 Offering. Further, until ninety (90) days after the closing of the June 2019 Offering, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, offer or issue any securities (or enter into any agreement with respect thereto) other than customary exceptions; (b) the Company may also not enter into any variable rate transactions so long as any of the Warrants are still outstanding; (c) each of our directors and executive officers, have entered into lock-up agreements that generally prohibit the sale, transfer, or other disposition of our securities, without the prior written consent of the Investors, for a period of sixty (60) days following the closing of the June 2019 Offering; (d) the Company entered into leak-out agreements with the Investors which provide that during the period commencing on June 17, 2019, and ending on the fortieth (40th) day after such date, each of the Investors cannot sell, dispose or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly, (including, without limitation, any sales, short sales, swaps or any derivative transactions that would be equivalent to any sales or short positions) on any trading day during the Restricted Period (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (any such date, a “Date of Determination”), shares of common stock held by the Investors as of June 17, 2019, including the Shares and the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants, in an amount more than each Investor’s pro-rate amount of 30% of the daily average composite trading volume of the common stock as reported by Bloomberg, LP for the applicable Date of Determination.
