ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Company Overview 
 CareDx, Inc. (“CareDx” or the “Company” or “we” or “us” and “our”) together with our subsidiaries, is a global transplant diagnostics company with product offerings along the pre- and post-transplant continuum.  We focus on discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic solutions for transplant patients.  In diagnostic testing services, we offers AlloMap, which is a gene expression solution for heart transplant patients and AlloSure, which is a donor-derived cell-free DNA (“dd-cfDNA”) solution initially commercialized for kidney transplant patients.  We also offer high quality products that increase the chance of successful transplants by facilitating a better match between a donor and a recipient of stem cells and organs.
Testing Services
 AlloMap
 Our first commercialized testing solution, the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test, or AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate-to-severe acute cellular rejection.  Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap, secure positive reimbursement decisions for AlloMap from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance.  We believe the use of AlloMap, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant.  In particular, we believe AlloMap can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants.  AlloMap has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for marketing and sale as a test to aid in the identification of recipients with a low probability of moderate or severe acute cellular rejection. 
 AlloMap has been a covered service for Medicare beneficiaries since January 1, 2006.  The 2018 reimbursement rate for AlloMap was $3,240, which represents a 14% increase over the 2017 reimbursement rate. AlloMap has also received positive coverage decisions from many of the largest U.S. private payers, including Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Health Care Services Corporation (HCSC), Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., TRICARE, and UnitedHealthcare. 
 We have also successfully completed a number of landmark clinical trials in the transplant field demonstrating the clinical utility of AlloMap for surveillance of heart transplant recipients.  We initially established the analytical and clinical validity of AlloMap on the basis of our Cardiac Transplanted Organ Rejection Gene Expression Observational (Deng, M. et al., Am J Transplantation 2006), or CARGO, study, which was published in the American Journal of Transplantation.  A subsequent clinical utility trial, Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression (Pham MX et al., N. Eng. J. Med., 2010), or IMAGE, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap surveillance were equivalent to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies.  The results of our clinical trials have also been presented at major medical society congresses and published in peer-reviewed publications in leading medical journals.
 Since the launch of AlloMap in January 2005, we have performed more than 123,000 commercial AlloMap tests, including 16,116 tests during 2018, from our Brisbane, California, laboratory. We estimate that there are approximately 138 centers performing heart transplants in the United States. In 2018, 133 of these centers used AlloMap.

AlloSure
 AlloSure, our surveillance solution for kidney transplant recipients, applies proprietary next generation sequencing technology to measure dd-cfDNA in the blood stream emanating from the donor organ.  We believe AlloSure may help clinicians determine rejection-specific activity manifested as cell damage in the transplanted organ.  We also believe the use of AlloSure, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a kidney transplant.  In particular, we believe AlloSure can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers to reduce the use of invasive biopsies and determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants.  Effective October 9, 2017, AlloSure became available for commercial testing with Medicare coverage and reimbursement.  The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure is $2,841.  AlloSure has also received payment from private payers on a case-by-case basis, while our Payer Relations team works to establish positive coverage. However, no positive coverage decisions have been made to the date of this filing.
 Prior to the commercialization of AlloSure, we generated a strong body of clinical evidence.  In late 2015, we announced the completion of analytical validation of AlloSure.  Samples used in the analytical validation included donor recipient pairs with unrelated donors, as well as closely related family members.  A report describing the analytical validation of AlloSure including clinical validation information for heart transplant, appeared in the November 2016 issue of The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics.  The Circulating Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA in Blood for Diagnosing Acute Rejection in Kidney Transplant Recipients, or DART, trial, sponsored by us, was conducted between April 2015 and January 2018. DART was a 14 center observational study of kidney transplant recipients where blood specimens were drawn periodically after transplant during follow up visits and also after treatment for acute rejection. By the time of completion of the first analysis, 384 patients were followed in DART for up to 24 months. The results demonstrated that increased levels of dd-cfDNA, determined by the AlloSure assay, discriminated active rejection of a kidney transplant more effectively than serum creatinine values. In collaboration with clinical investigators, we published these findings in the scientific peer-reviewed Journal of the American Society of Nephrology and the Journal Applied Laboratory Medicine in March 2017. A total of 2,109 patient visits had been accrued in DART by January 2018. We plan to analyze and report on additional findings from this dataset in 2019 and into the future.
 
In January 2018, we initiated the Kidney Allograft Outcomes AlloSure Registry study, or K-OAR, to develop further data on the clinical utility of AlloSure for surveillance of kidney transplant recipients. As of December 31, 2018, 47 centers had been initiated as K-OAR sites and 748 patients had been enrolled.
 
Throughout 2018, there were 11,634 AlloSure patient test results provided from our Brisbane, California, laboratory. In the fourth quarter of 2018, AlloSure was ordered by 100 kidney transplant centers in the United States.
 HeartCare
 In September, 2018, we initiated the Surveillance HeartCare® Outcomes Registry (“SHORE”). SHORE is a prospective, multi-center, observational, registry of patients receiving HeartCare for surveillance.
 
HeartCare combines the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure-Heart® in one surveillance solution. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from the two complementary measures: (i) AlloMap – a measure of immune activation, and (ii) AlloSure-Heart – a measure of graft injury. HeartCare provides complementary information about distinct biological processes, such as immune quiescence, active injury, Acute Cellular Rejection (“ACR”) and Antibody Mediated Rejection (“AMR”) in heart transplant recipients.
 Products
 We develop, manufacture, market and sell products that increase the chance of successful transplants by facilitating a better match between a donor and a recipient of stem cells and organs. Olerup SSP is used to type Human Leukocyte Antigen, or HLA alleles based on sequence-specific primer, or SSP, technology.  Olerup SBT is a complete product range for sequence-based typing of HLA alleles. QTYPE enables speed and precision in HLA typing at a low to intermediate resolution for samples that require a fast turn-around time and uses real-time polymerase chain reaction or, or PCR, methodology.  QTYPE received CE mark certification on April 10, 2018.

Sales and other financial information by geographic area is provided in Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Limitations of Existing Approaches for Surveillance of Transplant Recipients 
 The care of organ transplant recipients is an intense and costly effort and requires life-long surveillance and management by highly specialized clinicians and other healthcare providers.  The estimated U.S. average 2017 charges for a heart transplant is $1.38 million and for a kidney transplant is $0.41 million for the period 30 days before the transplant and 180 days after the transplant.  The lifetime cost for transplant recipients varies significantly depending on each individual patients circumstances.  Unsuccessful treatment of rejection can result in an additional transplant.  In 
 7


the case of a kidney transplant, the median annual Medicare cost of care for a recipient whose kidney fails and is on dialysis is 500% more than the median annual cost of care for a recipient with a functioning transplant.  
 The historical standard for heart transplant surveillance has been the microscopic examination of heart tissue obtained through an invasive endomyocardial biopsy.  In the biopsy procedure, a catheter is inserted into the right internal jugular vein in the recipient’s neck and threaded into the right ventricle of the heart.  Four pieces of tissue are cut from the wall of the heart and sent to the laboratory for examination by a pathologist who uses a microscope to look for evidence of cellular rejection.  Limitations of biopsies include: (i) the pathologist evaluations, which are subjective and dependent upon visual assessment and qualitative interpretation, (ii) tissue sampling errors, and (iii) the potential for procedure related complications such as damage to the valve structures in the heart.  The typical schedule of biopsy surveillance may involve eight to ten biopsies within the first six months after transplant and up to fifteen biopsies within the first year post-transplant.  Because repeated biopsies can cause cumulative risk and trauma to the heart, the frequency of biopsy surveillance after one year is low, despite the fact that recipients would benefit from continued monitoring for rejection and management of their immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives.  With less biopsy data collected after the first year post-transplant, clinicians have less information upon which to tailor immunosuppression treatment for their recipients. 
 The use of renal biopsies for surveillance of kidney transplants is similarly limited due to the costs and risks associated with the invasive procedure.  Therefore, the main clinical test of transplanted kidney surveillance is serum creatinine levels.  An increase in serum creatinine levels is an indicator of diminished kidney function, and although this test is widely used, changes in serum creatinine are nonspecific as to cause and not sensitive, as serum creatinine may only be detected after significant and irreversible renal function loss has occurred. 
 The prevention and treatment of rejection in heart and kidney transplant recipients is managed primarily through the use of immunosuppressive drugs.  Surveillance biopsies are infrequent after the first year because of procedural risks, discomfort, inconvenience, expense and the low rate of finding silent rejection.  As a result, clinicians have limited and infrequent information about an individual recipient’s risk of rejection over the months and years following transplant.  In the average recipient, the immune system gradually adapts to the organ graft, and the need for immunosuppression declines over time.  However, there is meaningful variation in the level of rejection activity and need for immunosuppression among transplant recipients.  Limited insight into the immune status of the individual recipient often causes clinicians to adopt a “one-size-fits all” approach to immunosuppression to help protect against the severe consequences of rejection.  Although typical doses of immunosuppressants result in a low rate of rejection in the transplant population as a whole, many individuals may receive more intense immunosuppressants than they actually need.  
 The Need for a Better Surveillance Solution 
 Improved post-transplant diagnostics are necessary to achieve further gains in the long-term care and health outcomes of heart, kidney and other organ transplant recipients.  More effective solutions for the surveillance and risk assessment of recipients would improve the clinician’s ability to individualize immunosuppression therapy and to reduce the use of invasive biopsies.  We believe that core elements of effective surveillance solutions include: 

• | highly accurate and quantitative results differentiating rejection from non-rejection status;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | non-invasive procedure that do not create risks to the recipient;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ease of implementation;
--+------------------------


• | earlier detection of rejection; and
--+------------------------------------


• | the ability to provide results with timing and at a frequency that allows for informed and effective treatment decisions.

Our Services and Products 
 Testing Services
 We develop and provide a diagnostic surveillance testing service for heart and kidney transplant recipients.

Our first commercialized testing solution, AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate-to-severe acute cellular rejection. AlloMap is designed to help health care providers and their patients to better manage long-term care, avoid the use of invasive surveillance biopsies and determine the appropriate dosage levels of immumosuppressant medications.  AlloMap uses a sample of the patient’s blood.  AlloMap may be used instead of a surveillance heart biopsy to rule out acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients.  AlloMap offers rapid, high quality results, and we aim to return AlloMap results to the clinician within three business days after the blood draw. 
 The test measures the molecular signatures that correlate with biological activity associated with moderate to severe acute cellular rejection. Gene expression may indicate acute cellular rejection well before the evidence of damage is visible from a tissue biopsy sample.  AlloMap applies a proprietary mathematical algorithm comprised of the expression of 20 genes, as measured by specific RNA levels.  Of the 20 genes, 11 are informative and 9 are for quality control.  The algorithm then yields a single AlloMap score.  AlloMap may be used for heart transplant recipients 15 years of age or older, starting on day 55 post-transplant. 
 AlloMap provides a single integer score ranging from 0 to 40 and determines the probability of the absence of moderate to severe acute cellular rejection.  A key benefit of the AlloMap score is its negative predictive value, or NPV.  The NPV of AlloMap is the likelihood that a heart transplant recipient does not have acute rejection.  The NPV for recipients with an AlloMap score below the threshold value can be greater than 99% depending on the actual score. 
 The clinical utility of AlloMap is well established.  AlloMap is the first and only non-invasive method recommended in the International Society for Heart & Lung Transplantation, or ISHLT, patient care guidelines for surveillance of heart transplant recipients for rejection in non-infants.  AlloMap has obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA as an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay, or IVDMIA.  In addition, the clinical utility of AlloMap is supported by numerous clinical trials that we have sponsored, the results of which have been published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. 
 When incorporating AlloMap into their practice, clinicians may consider recipient history, a physical exam, graft function and the results of AlloMap at each post-transplant clinic visit.  If the recipient’s AlloMap score is below an applicable threshold, in the absence of other clinical indicators of rejection, clinicians may elect not to conduct a surveillance biopsy at that time.  Where there are signs or indications of rejection, evidence of failure or impaired function or an AlloMap score greater than the applicable threshold, a biopsy may be ordered. 
 AlloMap Score Variability, or AMV, is a service we offer that we believe provides useful, complementary information to help personalize long-term care of heart transplant recipients.  It is available only upon request by clinicians.  A patient’s AMV is based on the variability of a patient’s AlloMap scores over time and may be used as a risk stratification tool in estimating the probability that one or more of the clinical events in heart transplant recipients may occur in the future.  AMV may be computed from four AlloMap test results within a 24-month period.  A low AMV may indicate a lower risk of future events, which suggests that a patient may be a potential candidate for reduced immunosuppression.  A high AMV may indicate a higher risk of future events, which suggests a patient may merit more vigilant surveillance.  The concept of AMV was developed over the course of several years, beginning as an observation in clinical studies of low score variability among stable patients which suggested that AMV might be a predictor of future clinical events and rejection episodes.  The Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational II, or CARGO II, study included data which demonstrated that AMV may be useful in estimating the probability of future adverse events, such as death, re-transplantation or graft failure in heart transplant recipients who were undergoing surveillance with AlloMap testing more than 315 days following transplantation. 
 AlloSure, our surveillance solution for kidney transplant recipients, applies proprietary next generation sequencing technology to measure dd-cfDNA in the blood stream emanating from the donor organ.  We believe AlloSure may help clinicians determine rejection-specific activity manifested as cell damage in the transplanted organ.  We also believe the use of AlloSure, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a kidney transplant.  In particular, we believe AlloSure can improve 
 9


patient care by helping healthcare providers to reduce the use of invasive biopsies and determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants.
 HeartCare combines the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure-Heart in one surveillance solution. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from the two complementary measures: (i) AlloMap – a measure of immune activity, and (ii) AlloSure-Heart – measures graft injury. HeartCare provides complementary information about distinct biological processes, such as immune quiescence, active injury, Acute Cellular Rejection (“ACR”) and Antibody Mediated Rejection (“AMR”) in heart transplant recipients.
 
Clinical Trials of AlloMap and AlloSure 
 The clinical validation and utility of AlloMap is supported by a number of major clinical trials involving more than 2,000 heart transplant recipients and published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals.  Our trials are designed to evaluate the clinical utility of our solutions and are an integral part of our business strategy, clinical development and marketing programs.  In heart transplantation, two major observational trials, CARGO and CARGO II, enabled the initial development, validation and further validation of AlloMap to detect and monitor acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients.  In addition to preserving blood samples and clinical data from these two trials, we have sponsored a multi-year, 34 multicenter-registry named OAR, which focuses on long-term outcomes of patients.  We expect these samples and data to enable further discovery and product development of new biomarkers of organ rejection activity, and new diagnostic solutions.  These repositories contain over 37,000 samples obtained from individual recipients who were typically followed for 10 serial visits and over one year or more, and who in many cases have associated biopsy-based rejection grades and other clinical outcome endpoints.  We believe this extensive biorepository and database will be useful for new product development derived from analyses, correlative studies and validation efforts. 
 Additional clinical utility trials, including IMAGE and the Early Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression, or EIMAGE, have demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap surveillance were equivalent to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies. We have also published two reports of retrospective analyses from IMAGE and CARGO II trials that demonstrate that the variability in AlloMap scores over time in an individual patient may be useful in predicting the risk for the patient of a future event of rejection and graft dysfunction. 
 In March 2017, the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology published the article Cell-Free DNA and Active Rejection in Kidney Allografts.  The article reports that increased levels of dd-cfDNA detected using AlloSure are associated with active rejection of the kidney allograft.  The DART study evidence suggests that AlloSure, a non-invasive blood test, may enable more frequent, quantitative, and safer assessment of allograft rejection and injury. As part of a surveillance strategy, AlloSure could help identify patients with new or ongoing organ injury.  In the DART study, to investigate the use of AlloSure as a surveillance tool, the investigators prospectively collected blood specimens from renal transplant patients at scheduled intervals and at the time of clinically indicated biopsies. Key findings of the study were as follows:
  
• | AlloSure provides clear stratification of patients for probability of rejection;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Active rejection patients showed median AlloSure levels at 1.6%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antibody- mediated rejection, or ABMR, patients showed median AlloSure levels at 2.9%;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-rejection patients showed median AlloSure levels of 0.21%; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AlloSure was superior to serum creatinine in identifying which patients had active rejection.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This was the first report to establish clinical performance characteristics for dd-cfDNA in renal transplant patients with an analytically validated assay of dd-cfDNA in the largest (N =398 patients) prospective, multicenter observational study of dd-cfDNA.  Elevations in AlloSure were found to be strongly correlated with active rejection, especially ABMR. ABMR is increasingly recognized as the form of immune-mediated injury causing long-term 
 10


graft loss.  This progress was made possible by collaboration with 14 major renal transplant centers and their patients who volunteered to participate in the study.
 A publication in the Journal of Applied Laboratory Medicine in March 2017 described the biological variation and clinical reference intervals of dd-cfDNA in stable healthy renal transplant recipients.
 The AlloSure test has been approved for Medicare coverage for clinical use when a physician determines there is a need to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant recipients.  The DART study suggests that AlloSure can be used to discriminate the probability of active rejection from absence of rejection in a renal transplant recipient.  Use of the test may reduce invasive percutaneous renal biopsy procedures among patients with a suspicion of rejection.
 Publications based on the analyses of the accumulated DART database results were used as a guide to design K-OAR.  K-OAR is a multicenter, non-blinded, prospective observational cohort study which plans to enroll greater than 1,000 renal transplant patients who will receive AlloSure long-term surveillance. The clinical outcomes of these patients will be entered into a registry database. The study cohort will include 300 patients at centers that will obtain planned renal surveillance biopsies at 12 months post-transplantation.  The other greater than 700 patients will be from centers that do not perform protocol surveillance biopsies. Outcomes in this greater than 700 patient sub-cohort, which represents the majority of the intended use population in the U.S., will be compared to the outcomes of the 300 AlloSure tests from the 12 month surveillance biopsy centers.
 A matched control cohort of 300 patients will be retrospectively selected from the subset of centers providing the test cohort patients who have planned surveillance biopsies at 12 months post-transplantation.  The primary safety endpoint of this study is the amount of kidney tissue scarring and atrophy at one-year post-transplant, quantified by biopsy-based histopathology grade(s). The primary efficacy endpoint is the number of renal allograft biopsies performed during the first year.  Outcomes will include patient survival, graft survival, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate, evaluated at years 1, 2 and 3 post-transplantation.

dd-cfDNA for Kidney Transplants 
 Our published DART clinical study has established the clinical validity of a dd-cfDNA-based solution for kidney transplant patients, AlloSure.  This is the first report to establish clinical performance characteristics for this emerging molecular biomarker in renal transplant patients with an analytically validated assay of dd-cfDNA in the 
 12


largest (N =398 patients) prospective, multicenter observational study of dd-cfDNA.  The study population is representative of the spectrum renal transplant recipients in the United States. Elevations in AlloSure were found to be strongly correlated with active rejection, especially with ABMR. ABMR is increasingly recognized as the form of immune-mediated injury causing long-term graft loss.
 K-OAR is the next step in the further development of data to support the clinical utility of AlloSure.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC), Palmetto GBA (Palmetto”), in October 2017, recommended Medicare coverage for AlloSure which is contingent on this further data development.  The K-OAR study commenced in January 2018. K-OAR is a 1, 2 and 3 year post-transplant clinical outcomes study in patients managed with AlloSure surveillance compared to another 300 patients who will serve as a comparative control group managed without AlloSure. 
 dd-cfDNA for Heart Transplants 
 We believe that the AlloSure dd-cfDNA-based solution could provide additional value to AlloMap testing for clinicians caring for heart transplant patients, particularly in situations where a recipient’s AlloMap score suggests a probability of acute rejection. 
 Studies have reported that a higher percentage of dd-cfDNA in the blood stream of patients is found with moderate or severe heart rejection compared to patients without rejection. We believe a dd-cfDNA solution such as AlloSure for the heart could help clinicians identify recipients with a higher probability of rejection and help determine which patients warrant a subsequent biopsy, because the likelihood of detecting rejection in the biopsy specimen would be enhanced. 
 Accordingly, we are offer HeartCare. HeartCare combines the gene expression profiling technology of AlloMap with the dd-cfDNA analysis of AlloSure-Heart in one surveillance solution. An approach to surveillance using HeartCare provides information from the two complementary measures: (i) AlloMap – a measure of immune activation, and (ii) AlloSure-Heart – measures graft injury. HeartCare provides complementary information about distinct biological processes, such as immune quiescence, active injury, Acute Cellular Rejection and Antibody Mediated Rejection in heart transplant recipients.
 We have established our proprietary strategy for quantification of donor specific dd-cfDNA and we have completed initial proof of concept studies. We now offer AlloSure as a laboratory developed test for a limited number of heart transplant centers and physicians as part of our Utility of Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA in Association with Gene-Expression profiling (AlloMap) in Heart Transplant Recipients, or D-OAR, study.
 Product Advancement and Development
 Ongoing research and development in the pre-transplant arena encompasses six areas. First, the last decade of next generation sequencing has unveiled significant additional sequence diversity in the HLA region on chromosome 6 of the human genome. While the clinical impact of some of the sequence diversity is unclear, many newly identified HLA alleles need to be integrated into ongoing updates of the Olerup SSP and QTYPE kits. We have been updating, and intend to continue to update, our HLA typing kits with newly identified alleles. Olerup SSP and QTYPE use technology platforms that can readily accommodate this increase in HLA allele assays. 
 Second, the advent of NGS technology has enabled significant improvement in HLA sequencing data.  We are developing further improved versions of NGS HLA testing that will provide full gene coverage while streamlining the laboratory workflow.
 Third, our NGS testing platform will be a technology departure from commonly used approaches for HLA typing. This will enable the addition of non-HLA genes critical to transplant outcome. The addition of non-HLA genes will have no impact on workflow and enable the inclusion of increasing content, as new transplant outcome related genes are described.
 Fourth, depending on the specific indication, different levels of HLA typing resolution and follow up confirmatory testing are required. Olerup SSP and QTYPE flexible platforms are complemented with Olerup SBT and TruSight 
 13


HLA, and our research and development staff weave together the three typing product offerings to effectively address laboratory needs. 
 Fifth, the complexity of the HLA region benefits significantly from interpretive software solutions for the laboratories. We are committed to ongoing upgrades to our software solutions to further simplify the use of the various HLA kits. 
 Finally, our research and development staff in transplant environment is working closely together to advance the synergies of products across the pre- and post-transplant continuum.
 Reimbursement 
 We have been successful in achieving reimbursement for our testing services. 
 Reimbursement for AlloMap comes primarily from Medicare, private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations, Medicaid and hospitals.  A number of payers have adopted coverage policies approving AlloMap for reimbursement.  Such policies often approve reimbursement for tests performed from six months or one year post-transplant through five years post-transplant.  For tests performed outside the scope of the payer’s policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis.  If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue payment through the particular payer’s appeal process. 
 Following the assignment of a Category 1 Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT code, for AlloMap in September 2015, CMS, issued a proposed Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, Preliminary Determinations for calendar year 2016.  In October 2016, CMS reversed its preliminary gapfill determination for the 2017 CLFS and restored the final pricing determinations for AlloMap in the 2017 CLFS to $2,821.  The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenues from payments made under the CLFS would report initially and then on a subsequent three-year basis thereafter (or annually for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, or ADLTs), private payer payment rates and volumes for their tests.  CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for the tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payer payment rates for the tests. Effective January 1, 2018, Medicare reimburses $3,240 for AlloMap testing of Medicare beneficiaries, which represents a 14% increase over the 2017 reimbursement rate.  Effective October 9, 2017, AlloSure is reimbursed for kidney transplant patients covered by Medicare. The Medicare reimbursement rate for AlloSure is $2,841.
 Medicare coverage and reimbursement was determined by the Molecular Diagnostic Services, or MolDX, Program developed by Palmetto GBA (“Palmetto”).  AlloSure began to be reimbursed at a rate of $2,841 for kidney transplants patients covered by Medicare across the United States on October 9, 2017, the effective date of the Palmetto local coverage determination, or LCD. AlloSure has also received payment from private payers on a case-by-case basis, while our Payer Relations team works to establish positive coverage. However, no positive coverage decisions have been made to the date of this filing.
 Medicare 
 We are reimbursed by Medicare for AlloMap and AlloSure tests performed on patients covered by Medicare. Tests performed on patients covered by Medicare represented 46%, 30% and 34% of all tests in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 62%, 27% and 44% of all testing services revenue was derived from Medicare for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Private Payers and Medicaid Payers 
 We are reimbursed for a substantial portion of the AlloMap tests we perform on patients covered by private payers. Coverage policies approving AlloMap for reimbursement have been adopted by many of the largest private payers, including Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Health Care Services (HCSC), Humana, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., TRICARE, and UnitedHealthcare. Many other payers have positive coverage policies for AlloMap. With private 
 14


payers and Medicaid payers that have not yet adopted positive coverage policies for AlloMap, we obtain reimbursement from those payers on a case-by-case basis for a significant portion of claims.
 As of yet, no private payers or Medicaid payers have adopted positive coverage policies for AlloSure.  As a result, we obtain reimbursement from those payers on a case-by-case basis.
 International 
 Our products have a broad international presence.  We sell directly to customers in many regions and also sell through third-party distributors and sub-distributors throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
 In 2013, we initiated a commercial agreement with Diaxonhit SA (“Diaxonit”), a leader in specialty in-vitro diagnostics for transplantation, infectious diseases and cancer. The agreement carries a 10-year term and grants Diaxonhit exclusive rights to promote AlloMap in Europe. Diaxonhit has agreed to commercialize AlloMap in all countries in western and central Europe directly and through sub-partners. Under the terms of our agreement, we provide Diaxonhit with training and a license to perform AlloMap. In Europe, we receive revenue in two ways: first, through our sale of testing materials to Diaxonhit, and second, through royalties on Diaxonhit’s net earnings from sales of AlloMap. Diaxonhit pays royalties to us as a percentage of the net earnings from sales, as defined in the agreement, of AlloMap tests, in the mid to high teens. Diaxonhit made an upfront payment to us in cash of approximately €387,500 ($408,000) and Diaxonhit’s publicly traded common stock with a value at the time of €387,000 following execution of the agreement. Through Diaxonhit, we have also secured a dedicated laboratory, the Strasbourg University Hospital Central Immunology Laboratory, or HUS, in France.
 Testing and Laboratory Operations 
 Our laboratory operations, where we perform all AlloMap and AlloSure testing, are headquartered at our Brisbane, California laboratory. Our laboratory holds a certificate of accreditation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and is accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”).  We believe that our laboratory capacity will be adequate to meet demand for AlloMap and AlloSure for the next few years. 
 When a clinician orders AlloMap, a blood sample is drawn and processed to isolate the white blood cells, which are subsequently broken down, frozen and sent via overnight courier to our laboratory.  Each of the 20 genes comprising AlloMap is tested in triplicate, and the 11 informative genes are combined to produce the AlloMap score.  The remaining 9 genes are used as part of the rigorous quality control testing performed to assess every phase of the test process. The test results are reported to the ordering clinician by fax or electronically via WebPortal within two business days of receipt of the sample.  Test samples that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected. 
 When AlloSure is ordered by a clinician, a blood sample is drawn and sent overnight at ambient temperature to our laboratory. Cell-free DNA is purified from the plasma and the fraction of the total cell-free DNA derived from the transplanted organ, the dd-cfDNA, is quantified and reported as a percentage. Tests that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected.  Results are reported to the ordering clinician by fax or electronically within our WebPortal within two business days of receipt.
 We rely solely on certain suppliers to provide some of the laboratory instruments and key reagents that we use to perform AlloMap and AlloSure testing. These sole source suppliers include Thermo Fisher Scientific, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents, a master mix formula and consumables; Roche Molecular Systems, which supplies us with laboratory reagents and consumables; Illumina, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents and consumables; Becton, Dickinson, and Streck, which supplies us with cell preparation tubes; Beckman Coulter, which provides laboratory reagents and consumables; and Qiagen N.V., which supplies us with a proprietary buffer reagent.
 Manufacturing
 We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our product kits from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain 
 15


components and critical raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop alternate backup plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to the manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our manufacturing facility in Stockholm, Sweden is used to support the production, packaging and labeling of our proprietary test kits: Olerup SSP, XM-One, and QTYPE.  The facility has a certified Quality Management System, or QMS, to standards ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485: 2016.  These standards include a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services. ISO is an internationally recognized standard for QMSx.  Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification.  The facility maintains a valid EC certificate for compliance to Directive 98/79/EC Annex IV, excluding Sections 4 and 6, Full Quality Assurance System In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices. Annual surveillance audits are also conducted by the site’s notified body to ensure ongoing compliance.  Additionally, we seek to manufacture to current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations.
 Our manufacturing facility in Fremantle, Australia, is used to support the production, packaging and labeling of our proprietary Olerup SBT brand kits. The facility maintains a valid EC certificate for compliance to Directive 98/79/EC Annex IV, excluding Sections 4 and 6, Full Quality Assurance System In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices, and is certified to standards ISO 13485: 2016 and the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System, or CMDCAS, for Medical Devices, undergoing the same certification and surveillance audit requirements.
 Sales and Marketing
 Testing Services Sales and Marketing Team
 We have a direct field team in the United States that interacts with all aspects of the testing services channel, including sales, marketing, medical science liaison, managed care, and patient care management representatives. 
 Our marketing strategy focuses on the clinical benefits of AlloMap and AlloSure, and the scientific validation that supports our tests. Our strategy includes education to clinicians and the care team at transplant centers, assistance with scheduling ordered tests for patients, and working with centers to adopt formal protocols.
 Product Sales and Marketing Team
 The product business has sales offices in Vienna, Austria; Stockholm, Sweden; West Chester Pennsylvania, United States; and Fremantle, Australia, which manage direct sales to customers and sales through third-party distributors.  As of December 31, 2018, the sales and marketing team consisted of 20 employees, including sales, marketing, brand managers, and customer service representatives. 
Competition 
 Because of our comprehensive portfolio of HLA typing products and surveillance diagnostic test services, we face many different types of competition.  
 Testing Services
 Our competition principally includes clinical reference labs and hospital labs using existing and routine clinical chemistry tests. We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include:

• | quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | confidence in diagnostic results;
--+----------------------------------

 16


 
• | technical performance and innovation to deliver new products that provide clinically actionable results;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation among customers as a provider of high value diagnostic tests and diagnostic test services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the extent of reimbursement;
--+-----------------------------


• | inclusion in practice guidelines;
--+----------------------------------


• | cost-effectiveness; and
--+------------------------


• | ease of use.
--+-------------

 We believe we compete favorably on the factors described above. 
 Existing diagnostic methods for heart transplant rejection generally involve evaluating biopsy samples to determine the presence or absence of rejection, while existing diagnostic methods for kidney transplant rejection include general, non-specific clinical chemistry tests, though biopsies are also a surveillance diagnostic tool. Both of these practices have been the standard of care in the United States for many years, and we will need to continue to educate clinicians, transplant recipients and payers about the various benefits of our tests in order to change clinical practice. Also, many transplant centers are located within hospitals that have their own laboratory facilities and have capacity to conduct various tests so hospitals may choose to rely on internally developed and/or internally performed surveillance and diagnostic tests. 
 We expect the competition for post-transplant surveillance to increase as there are several established and early-stage companies in the process of developing products and services for the transplant market that may directly or indirectly compete with AlloMap, AlloSure or our development pipeline. In addition, companies that have not historically focused on transplantation, but have knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology, have indicated they are considering this market. 
 Products
 Our competitors within the HLA tissue typing markets comprise a diverse range of manufacturers servicing hospital and commercial reference testing laboratories.  The market leader in HLA typing and third party distributors is Thermo Fisher through its acquisition of transplant-focused companies One Lambda and Life Technologies. In certain HLA tissue typing markets that incorporate a wide variety of technology test platforms, such as SSP, SBT, SSO and NGS, competitors include Thermo Fisher, Omixon, GenDx and Immucor.  We also face competition from hospital and commercial reference labs that develop their own in-house testing solutions known in the diagnostics industry as “home brews”.  We believe that our product line competes favorably with Thermo Fisher as a leading supplier of HLA test kits based on performance, reputation and service.
 We expect future competition for post-transplant surveillance kitted solutions as we launch AlloSeq cfDNA and AlloSeq BMT.  There are several established and early-stage companies in the process of developing products and services for the transplant market that may directly or indirectly compete with our development pipeline. In addition, companies that have not historically focused on transplantation, but have knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology, have indicated they are considering the transplantation market.
 Overall Competition
 Our potential competitors may have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do.  Other competitors may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by clinicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our solution, offer solutions that may be more accurate or effective than our solutions or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our current and future solutions and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.

Intellectual Property 
 Patents and Proprietary Technology
 In order to remain competitive, we seek to develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, material data transfer agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We generally protect this information with confidentiality agreements and reasonable security measures. 
 Our core patent position for AlloMap is based on issued patents and patent applications disclosing identification of genes differentially expressed between activated and resting leukocytes and demonstration of correlation between gene expression patterns and specific clinical states and outcomes. Our strategy is to continue to broaden our intellectual property estate for AlloMap through data science discovery and protection of gene expression patterns and their correlation with specific clinical states and outcomes, as well as the algorithms needed for clinical assessment. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 23 issued U.S. patents related to transplant rejection and autoimmunity.  We have five issued U.S. patents covering methods of diagnosing transplant rejection that use all 11 informative genes measured in AlloMap.  The expiration dates of these patents range from 2021 to 2024.  We have five additional patents covering additional genes or gene variants for diagnosing transplant rejection.  In the area of dd-cfDNA-based transplant diagnostics, we have filed a patent application to cover our research and development work in this field. In connection with our June 2014 acquisition of IMX, we obtained an exclusive license from Stanford to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA. This patent has an expiration date of November 5, 2030. A second patent included in the license from Stanford was issued in December 2017 and further covers the use of dd-cfDNA to diagnose and predict transplant status or outcome. As part of our April 2016 acquisition of Allenex, we obtained an additional five U.S. patents on donor matching technology and treatment for antibody mediated transplant rejection. We have six issued U.S. patents covering a method of diagnosing or monitoring autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, such as lupus, by detecting specific genes. While we have clinical samples and patents covering lupus diagnostics, we do not intend to actively pursue the lupus test opportunity. 
 We have developed trade secrets and know-how since our inception. These trade secrets and know-how are found particularly in technical areas such as optimized systems for making precise and reproducible q-PCR, measurements, and in the analysis of genomic data and algorithm development. 
 AlloMap, AlloSure, AlloSeq, Olerup SSP, Olerup XM-ONE, QTYPE and CareDx are registered trademarks of ours in the United States. 
 License Agreements
 We currently rely on license agreements to obtain rights under certain patents that we believe may be necessary to make, use and sell our AlloMap and AlloSure tests and future solutions. We may in the future rely, at least in part, upon licensing agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights and transfers of technology, information and know-how that enable us to further our development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. 
 In November 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche, as amended from time to time, the Roche License. The Roche License grants us the right to use PCR and q-PCR for use in clinical laboratory services. The Roche License is a non-exclusive license agreement in the United States covering the claims in multiple Roche patents. Under the terms of the Roche License, we were required to report and pay royalties, after adjustment due to a discount for combination services, in the mid-single digits on test revenues from products using the licensed intellectual property on a quarterly basis until September 30, 2017, pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, dated September 11, 2014.  Effective September 30, 2017, no royalties are incurred by us under the Roche License.
 18


In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Stanford, which granted us an exclusive license to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA and a non-exclusive license to related technology provided by Stanford. Subject to various rights of extension, we are required to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones set forth in the license agreement. Under the terms of the Stanford license, we are required to report and pay an annual license maintenance fee, six milestone payments and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology. The license maintenance fee may be offset against earned royalty payments due on net sales in that year.
 In May 2018, we entered into the License Agreement with Illumina, which provides us with worldwide distribution, development and commercialization rights to Illumina’s next generation sequencing product line for use in transplantation diagnostic testing. 
 Regulation 
 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
 Having a clinical laboratory in California, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under the CLIA, administered by CMS, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of work we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems, proficiency testing and performance. Almost all clinical laboratories are subject to regulation under the CLIA, which is designed to ensure that laboratory testing services performed on materials derived from the human body are accurate and reliable. 
 We have a certificate of accreditation under the CLIA to perform “high complexity” testing. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent personnel and quality system requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards.  We were inspected as part of the customary College of American Pathologists audit in 2018 and recertified under the CLIA as a result of passing that inspection. 
 California Laboratory Licensing 
 In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under the CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the laboratory. We are required to maintain compliance with California standards as a condition to continued operation of our laboratory in California. 
Other States’ Laboratory Testing 
 Other states require out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens for testing from those states to be licensed. We have obtained licenses in California, Florida, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws. 
Food and Drug Administration 
 The FDA regulates the design, testing, development, manufacture, safety, labeling, marketing, promotion, storage, sale and distribution of medical devices pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FFDCA and its implementing regulations govern, among other things, the following activities relating to our medical devices: preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export, and advertising and promotion. These regulations apply to all of our products sold in the United States, as well as our facilities in Stockholm, Sweden used to produce some of our products. The FDA has also asserted that it has the authority to regulate laboratory developed tests (“LDTs”) as medical devices under the FFDCA. An LDT is a test developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory, such as AlloMap or AlloSure. 
 19


The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because it regulates the primary components in most laboratory-developed tests and because it believes that laboratories certified as high complexity under the CLIA, such as ours, have demonstrated expertise and ability in test procedures and analysis. In the event the FDA changes their policy in regards to “Enforcement discretion” for LDTs, it could require us to modify our business model and incur higher costs in order to maintain compliance with this new policy. A similar situation may occur if Congress decides to enable newly proposed regulations, such as the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development Act of 2018 (the “VALID Act of 2018”). For AlloSure and other similar testing solutions, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate clinical validity and utility of our test, and submit to the FDA a premarket approval application, or PMA, or 510(k) premarket notification application and obtain approval or clearance for the test subsequent to commercialization. There can be no assurance that any of our tests or additional uses of our tests for which we seek clearance or approval in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, or at all, and there can be no assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our current and future tests. Moreover, any new FDA or regulatory requirements could complicate our compliance efforts. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
 Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information and standardize data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and the standardized identifiers used by healthcare providers, such as us, and health plans.  
 We have developed policies and procedures to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements or a significant breach to protected health information (“PHI”) may occur. 
 In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. 
 Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions 
 We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar state restrictions such as California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, or PORA. Where applicable, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing patients or certain governmental or private payers for clinical laboratory testing services when the physician ordering the test, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 
 Both the Stark Law and PORA contain exceptions for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the applicable exceptions to the Stark Law and PORA. However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, PORA or similar state laws. 
 Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following: 
  
• | denial of Medicare payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20


 
• | exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. 
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs.  Our business is subject to compliance with these laws.  In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States.  The Affordable Care Act expands the government’s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement.
 There have been recent public announcements by members of the U.S. Congress and President Trump and his administration regarding their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. We cannot predict the ultimate form or timing of any repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act or the effect such repeal or replacement would have on our business.
 Anti-Kickback Statutes 
 The federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. 
 The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments.  Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also are actionable under the federal False Claims Act. 
 Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
 Federal False Claims Act 
 The False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. 
 21


When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate instance of false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of causing physicians to order excessive or unnecessary services, providing false documentation in support of claims, kickbacks, off-label promotion of products, Stark Law violations and other improper referrals and CLIA violations, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered.  Our future activities relating to billing, compliance with the CLIA and Medicare reimbursement requirements, physician and other healthcare provider financial relationships and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws.
 Foreign Jurisdictions
 Laws and regulations outside of the United States also apply to our products. The number and scope of these requirements continues to grow, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain any approvals that may be required to market our pre-transplant line of products outside the United States. Further, there may be significant expense and effort required to comply with these approvals for new products as they become ready for the commercial marketplace or for our existing products that we wish to sell abroad. 
 We currently produce products, which are CE labeled and subject to the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC), or IVDD, a European Union, or EU, Directive. Some of our products are currently labeled by self-declaration based on their intended use or certified by a Notified Body for Compliance of the IVDD requirements. A product that is not CE marked is automatically considered to be non-compliant. Appointed national enforcement agencies monitor the market for violations and imported products are checked for compliance at customs offices.
 No in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the IVDD. Devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the CE marking of conformity, placed by the manufacturer, when introduced on the market. A manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name must notify its national competent authorities.
 Our products also comply with the CMDCAS, which is a system designed to implement Canadian regulations requiring some medical devices be designed and manufactured under a registered QMS. The SCC and Health Canada's Therapeutic Products Directorate developed this system. CMDCAS came into effect January 1, 2003.
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2018, we had 231 employees, of which 227 were full-time employees. We had 69 employees in manufacturing operations and support, 51 in research and development; 61 in sales and marketing and 50 in general and administrative positions. As of December 31, 2018, 162 employees were located in the United States and 69 were located outside of the United States.
 From time to time, we also employ independent contractors, consultants and temporary employees to support our operations. Currently, the Olerup SSP Production Group in Sweden is represented by an IF Metall collective bargaining agreement. None of our other employees are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials), which subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, or holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. In addition, we could be subject to significant fines for failure to
