 Item 1.  Business. 
 ﻿
 References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “Green Plains,” or the “company” refer to Green Plains Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains is an Iowa corporation, founded in June 2004 as an ethanol producer. We have grown through acquisitions of ethanol production facilities and adjacent commodity processing businesses. We are focused on generating stable operating margins through our business segments and risk management strategy. We own and operate assets throughout the ethanol value chain: upstream, with grain handling and storage; through our ethanol production facilities; and downstream, with marketing and distribution services to mitigate commodity price volatility, which differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production. Our other businesses, including our partnership and cattle feeding operations leverage our supply chain, production platform and expertise.
 ﻿
 We formed Green Plains Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to be our primary downstream storage and logistics provider since its assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol we produce. The partnership completed its IPO on July 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2018, we own a 49.1% limited partner interest, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of the partnership’s incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 48.9% limited partner interest. The partnership is consolidated in our financial statements.
 ﻿
 We group our business activities into the following four operating segments to manage performance: 
 ﻿

· | Ethanol Production. Our ethanol production segment includes the production of ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil at 13 ethanol plants in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas. At capacity, our facilities are capable of processing approximately 387 million bushels of corn per year and producing approximately 1.1 billion gallons of ethanol, 2.9 million tons of distillers grains and 292 million pounds of industrial grade corn oil, making us one of the largest ethanol producers in North America. On November 15, 2018, we completed the sale of three ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa and Riga, Michigan and announced the permanent closure of our ethanol plant located in Hopewell, Virginia.

  ﻿

· | Agribusiness and Energy Services. Our agribusiness and energy services segment includes grain procurement, with approximately 47.2 million bushels of grain storage capacity, and our commodity marketing business, which markets, sells and distributes ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil produced at our ethanol plants. We also market ethanol for a third-party producer as well as buy and sell ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil, crude oil, grain, natural gas and other commodities in various markets. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Food and Ingredients. Our food and ingredients segment includes six cattle feeding operations with the capacity to support approximately 355,000 head of cattle and grain storage capacity of approximately 11.7 million bushels and food-grade corn oil operations. Fleischmann’s Vinegar, one of the world’s largest producers of food-grade industrial vinegar, was also included in the food and ingredients segment until its sale on November 27, 2018. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

· | Partnership. Our master limited partnership provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage tanks, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. The partnership’s assets include 32 ethanol storage facilities, seven fuel terminal facilities and approximately 2,840 leased railcars.

Risk Management and Hedging Activities
 ﻿
 Our profitability is highly dependent on commodity prices, particularly for ethanol, corn, distillers grains, corn oil, natural gas and cattle. Since market price fluctuations among these commodities are not always correlated, ethanol production or our cattle feeding operations may be unprofitable at times. We use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to monitor real-time operating price risk exposure at each of our operations to obtain favorable margins, when available, or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins.
 ﻿
 We use forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol, distillers grains, and corn oil production or buy some of the corn, natural gas, cattle, or ethanol we need to partially offset commodity price volatility. We also engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas, ethanol, cattle and other commodities. The 

 
3


 


financial impact of these activities depends on the price of the commodities involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver those commodities.
 ﻿
 Hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss when the counterparty defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, when the expected differential between the price of the underlying commodity and physical commodity changes. Hedging activities can result in losses when a position is purchased in a declining market or sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn, natural gas and feeder cattle and an increased cash price for ethanol, distillers grains, corn oil and live cattle. Depending on the circumstance, we vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake and sometimes choose not to engage in hedging transactions at all.
 ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We are focused on managing commodity price risks, improving operational efficiencies and optimizing market opportunities to create an efficient platform with diversified income streams. Our competitive strengths include: 
 ﻿
 Disciplined Risk Management.  Risk management is a core competency and we use a variety of risk management tools and hedging strategies to maintain a disciplined approach. Our internally developed operating margin management system allows us to monitor commodity price risk exposure at each of our operations and lock in favorable margins, when available, or temporarily reduce production levels during periods of compressed margins. 
 ﻿
 Operational Excellence.  Our facilities are staffed with experienced industry personnel who share operational knowledge and expertise. We focus on making incremental operational improvements to enhance performance using real-time production data and systems to monitor our operations and optimize performance. Additionally, our operational expertise helps us improve the operating margins of acquired facilities. 
 ﻿
 Technology Integration.  Over our history, we have incorporated new technologies like corn oil extraction and Selective Milling Technology™ into our manufacturing processes that have enabled us to run more efficiently and improve our financial results. We continue to evaluate additional technological opportunities to expand our capabilities and product offerings in the coming years.    
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Our senior management team averages approximately 25 years of commodity risk management and related industry experience. We have specific expertise across all of our businesses, including plant operations and management, commodity markets and risk management, and ethanol marketing and distribution. Our management team’s level of operational and financial expertise is essential to successfully executing our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by heightened environmental concerns and energy independence goals, supported by government policies and regulations. In the 1990’s, federal law required the use of oxygenates in reformulated gasoline to reduce vehicle emissions in cities with unhealthy levels of air pollution. Today, ethanol is the primary oxygenate used by the U.S. refining industry to meet various federal and state air emission standards. The high octane value of ethanol has also made it the primary additive used by refiners to increase octane value, which improves engine performance. Accordingly, ethanol has become a valuable blend component that comprises approximately 10% of the domestic gasoline supply with the potential to grow with higher blends and increased gasoline demand. Ethanol usage is further supported by federal government mandates under RFS II, which assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. Advances in domestic corn yields have helped the U.S. ethanol industry become the lowest-cost producer of ethanol, surpassing Brazil, creating demand for U.S. ethanol worldwide.
 ﻿
 We also believe that the world will continue to increase its demand for protein for human consumption, driving the need to produce larger amounts of high protein feed for animals and aquaculture. With new technologies introduced in the ethanol industry, we believe that ethanol production facilities can increasingly become high-protein feed producers. We have begun to deploy one of these new technologies in an effort to capture higher co-product returns, which could lead to an accelerated deployment of additional high-protein process technology installments at a number of our ethanol production facilities to take advantage of the world’s growing demand for protein.  
 ﻿
 In light of the ethanol industry’s environment, we are focused on maintaining a low-cost ethanol production platform and driving costs out where possible. Owning grain storage at or near our ethanol plants allows us to develop relationships with local producers and originate corn more effectively at a lower average cost. We purchase approximately two-thirds of our 

 
4


 


corn volume directly from farmers and have 45 production days of storage capacity at or near our ethanol plants. We use our performance data to develop strategies that can be applied across our platform and embrace technological advances to improve operational efficiencies and yields, such as Selective Milling Technology™ and Enogen® corn enzyme technology, to lower our processing cost per gallon and increase production volumes.
 ﻿
 We believe there is untapped value across our businesses and we intend to further develop and strengthen our business by identifying expansion projects that maximize our production capabilities and lower existing costs at our production facilities. We also seek to leverage our core competencies in adjacent businesses such as cattle feedlots, high protein animal feed and other commodity processing operations that maximize our operational and risk management expertise.
 ﻿
 Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2018. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 Bartlett Cattle Company, L.P. Acquisition
 ﻿
 On July 27, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire two cattle feeding operations from Bartlett Cattle Company, L.P. for $16.2 million, plus working capital of approximately $106.6 million. The transaction includes two feed yards located in Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas which added combined feedlot capacity of 97,000 head of cattle to the company’s operations. The transaction was financed using cash on hand and proceeds from the Green Plains Cattle senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The transaction closed on August 1, 2018, following receipt of regulatory approval.  
 ﻿
 Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement – Green Plains Cattle Company
 ﻿
 On July 31, 2018, we entered into an amendment of the Green Plains Cattle senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of the West and ING Capital LLC, increasing the maximum commitment from $425.0 million to $500.0 million. The amendment was completed to fund the additional working capital requirements related to the acquisition of the Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas cattle feeding operations. The amended credit facility also includes an accordion feature that enables the credit facility to be increased by up to $100.0 million with agent approval.
 ﻿
 3.25% Convertible Notes
 ﻿
 During the three months ended September 30, 2018, we entered into exchange agreements with certain beneficial owners of our outstanding 3.25% convertible senior notes due 2018 (the “Old Notes”), pursuant to which such investors exchanged (the “Exchange”) $56.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes for $56.8 million in aggregate principal amount of notes due October 1, 2019 (the “New Notes”). The New Notes were recorded at fair value at the time of the exchange, and we recorded a non-cash adjustment to additional paid-in capital of $3.5 million, net of a $1.2 million tax impact related to the difference in fair value of the embedded conversion option of the Old Notes and the New Notes. Following the closing of these agreements, $6.9 million aggregate principal of the Old Notes remain outstanding. On October 1, 2018, the maturity date of the Old Notes, the remaining aggregate principal of $6.9 million was paid.
 ﻿
 Disposition of Bluffton, Lakota and Riga Ethanol Plants
 ﻿
 On October 8, 2018, we, through wholly owned subsidiaries, entered into an asset purchase agreement for the sale of three ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa, and Riga, Michigan, and certain related assets from subsidiaries, to Valero Renewable Fuels Company, LLC (“Valero”) for the sale price of $319.8 million, including net preliminary working capital and other adjustments (the “Valero Transaction”). Correspondingly, the partnership’s storage assets located adjacent to such plants were sold to Green Plains Inc. for $120.9 million (the “Partnership Transaction”). On November 15, 2018, we closed on both the Partnership Transaction and the Valero Transaction. We received as consideration from Valero approximately $319.8 million, while the partnership received as consideration from the company 8.7 million partnership units and a portion of the general partner interest equating to 0.2 million equivalent limited partner units to maintain the general partner’s 2% interest. These units were retired upon receipt. In addition, the partnership also received cash consideration of $2.7 million from Valero for the assignment of certain railcar operating leases.

On November 27, 2018, we closed on the Kerry Transaction and received as consideration from Kerry $353.9 million in cash and restricted cash, including preliminary net working capital adjustments.
 ﻿
 Hopewell, Virginia Permanent Closure
 ﻿
 On November 15, 2018, we announced the permanent closure of our ethanol plant located in Hopewell, Virginia. The closure did not change the partnership’s quarterly storage and throughput minimum volume commitment with Green Plains Trade or current transload operations at that location.
 ﻿
 Term Loan Repayment
 ﻿
 In November 2018, we repaid the remaining balance of our $500.0 million term loan due August 29, 2023 using a portion of the proceeds from the transactions described above. We did not incur any early termination penalties to the lenders as a result of the repayment.  
 ﻿
 Operating Segments
 ﻿
 Ethanol Production Segment
 ﻿
 Industry Overview. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol or grain alcohol, is a colorless liquid produced by fermenting carbohydrates found in a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, and other cellulosic matter found in plants. Most of the ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because it contains large quantities of carbohydrates that convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass, which can be handled efficiently and is in greater supply than other grains. According to the USDA, on average, one bushel, or 56 pounds, of corn, produces approximately 2.7 gallons of ethanol, 17.5 pounds of distillers grains and 0.7 pounds of corn oil. Outside of the United States, sugarcane is the primary feedstock used to produce ethanol.
 ﻿
 Ethanol is a significant component of the biofuels industry, which includes all transportation fuels derived from renewable biological materials. Biofuels are an excellent oxygenate and source of octane. When added to petroleum-based transportation fuels, oxygenates reduce vehicle emissions. Ethanol is the most economical oxygenate and source of octane available on the market and its production costs are competitive with gasoline.

 Ethanol Plants. Following the sale of three ethanol plants located in Bluffton, Indiana, Lakota, Iowa and Riga, Michigan and the permanent closure of our ethanol plant located in Hopewell, Virginia, we now operate 13 dry mill ethanol production plants, located in seven states, that produce ethanol, distillers grains and corn oil:

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | We constructed these three plants; all other ethanol plants were acquired.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. Miles driven typically increases during the spring and summer months related to vacation travel, followed closely by the fall season due to holiday travel.
 ﻿
 The majority of our plants are equipped with industry-leading ICM or Delta-T ethanol processing technology. Our years of experience building, acquiring and operating these technologies provides us with a deep understanding of how to effectively and efficiently manage both platforms for maximum performance. 
 ﻿
 Corn Feedstock and Ethanol Production. Our plants use corn as feedstock in a dry mill ethanol production process. Each of our plants requires approximately 17 million to 42 million bushels of corn annually, depending on its production capacity. The price and availability of corn are subject to significant fluctuations driven by a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, governmental programs, freight costs and global demand. Ethanol producers are generally unable to pass increased corn costs to customers.
 ﻿
 Our corn supply is obtained primarily from local markets. We use cash and forward purchase contracts with grain producers and elevators to buy corn. We maintain direct relationships with local farmers, grain elevators and cooperatives, which serve as our primary sources of grain feedstock, at 11 of our ethanol plants. Most farmers in close proximity of our plants store corn in their own storage facilities. This allows us to purchase much of the corn we need directly from farmers throughout the year. At two of our ethanol plants, we contract with a third-party grain originator to supply the corn necessary for ethanol production. These contracts terminate in November 2023. Each of our plants is also situated on rail lines or has other logistical solutions to access corn supplies from other regions of the country should local supplies become insufficient.
 ﻿
 Corn is received at the plant by truck or rail then weighed and unloaded into a receiving building. Grain storage facilities are used to inventory grain that is passed through a scalper to remove rocks and debris prior to processing. The corn is then transported to a hammer mill where it is ground into coarse flour and conveyed into a slurry tank for enzymatic processing. Water, heat and enzymes are added to convert the complex starch molecules into simpler carbohydrates. The slurry is heated to reduce the potential of microbial contamination and pumped into a liquefaction tank where additional enzymes are added. Next, the grain slurry is pumped into fermenters, where yeast, enzymes, and nutrients are added and the fermentation process is started. A beer column, within the distillation system, separates the alcohol from the spent grain mash. The alcohol is dehydrated to 200-proof alcohol and either pumped into a holding tank and blended with approximately 2% denaturant as it is pumped into finished product storage tanks, or marketed as undenatured ethanol.
 ﻿
 Distillers Grains. The spent grain mash is pumped from the beer column into a decanter-type centrifuge for dewatering. The water, or thin stillage, is pumped from the centrifuge into an evaporator, where it is dried into a thick syrup. The solids, or wet cake, that exit the centrifuge are conveyed to the dryer system and dried at varying temperatures to produce distillers grains. Syrup may be reapplied to the wet cake prior to drying to provide additional nutrients. Distillers grains, the principal 

 
7


 


co-product of the ethanol production process, are used as high-protein, high-energy animal feed and marketed to the dairy, beef, swine and poultry industries. 
 ﻿
 We can produce three forms of distillers grains, depending on the number of times the solids are passed through the dryer system:

· | wet distillers grains, which contain approximately 65% to 70% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three days and is therefore sold to dairies or feedlots within the immediate vicinity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | modified wet distillers grains, which is dried further to approximately 50% to 55% moisture, have a shelf life of approximately three weeks and are marketed to regional dairies and feedlots; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | dried distillers grains, which have been dried more extensively to approximately 10% to 12% moisture, have an almost indefinite shelf life and may be stored, sold and shipped to any market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿

Corn Oil. Corn oil systems extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately before the production of distillers grains. Corn oil is produced by processing the syrup and evaporated thin stillage through a decanter-style, or disk-stack, centrifuge. The centrifuges separate the relatively light corn oil from the heavier components of the syrup, eliminating the need for significant retention time. We extract approximately 0.7 pounds of corn oil per bushel of corn used to produce ethanol. Industrial uses for corn oil include feedstock for biodiesel, livestock feed additives, rubber substitutes, rust preventatives, inks, textiles, soaps and insecticides. The syrup is blended into wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains.
 ﻿
 Natural Gas.  Depending on production parameters, our ethanol plants use approximately 20,000 to 45,000 BTUs of natural gas per gallon of production. We have service agreements to acquire the natural gas we need and transport the gas through pipelines to our plants.
 ﻿
 Electricity.  Our plants require between 0.5 and 1.5 kilowatt hours of electricity per gallon of production. Local utilities supply the necessary electricity to all of our ethanol plants.
 ﻿
 Water.  While some of our plants satisfy a majority of their water requirements from wells located on their respective properties, each plant also obtains drinkable water from local municipal water sources. Each facility either uses city water or operates a filtration system to purify the well water that is used for its operations. Local municipalities supply all of the necessary water for our plants that do not have onsite wells. Much of the water used in an ethanol plant is recycled in the production process.

----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 We buy bulk grain, primarily corn and soybeans, from area producers, and provide grain drying and storage services to those producers. The grain is used as feedstock for our ethanol plants or sold to grain processing companies and area livestock producers. Bulk grain commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and spreads. To mitigate risks related to market fluctuations from purchase and sale commitments of grain, as well as grain held in inventory, we enter into exchange-traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges at times.
 ﻿
 Seasonality is present within our agribusiness operations. The fall harvest period typically results in higher handling margins and stronger financial results during the fourth quarter of each year.
 ﻿
 Through Green Plains Trade, we market the ethanol we and a third party produce to local, regional, national and international customers. We also purchase ethanol from independent producers for pricing arbitrage. We sell to various markets under sales agreements with integrated energy companies; retailers, traders and resellers in the United States and buyers for export to Brazil, Canada, Europe, China and other international markets. Under these agreements, ethanol is priced under fixed and indexed pricing arrangements. 
 ﻿

Also through Green Plains Trade, we market wet and modified wet distillers grains to local markets and dried distillers grains to local, national and international markets. The bulk of our demand is delivered to geographic regions that do not have significant local corn or distillers grains production.
 ﻿
 Our markets can be further segmented by geographic region and livestock industry. Most of our wet and modified wet distillers grains are sold to midwestern feedlot markets. A substantial amount of dried distillers grains are shipped by barge, containers and rail to regional and national markets, as well as international markets. Our dried distillers grains are shipped to feedlots and poultry markets, as well as Texas and West Coast rail markets. Some of our distillers grains are shipped by truck to dairy, beef, and poultry operations in the eastern United States. We also ship by railcar to eastern and southeastern feed mills, poultry and dairy operations, and domestic trade companies. We sell dried distillers grains directly to international markets and indirectly to exporters for shipment. In 2018, we exported approximately 18% of our distillers grains production,

with the largest export markets for distillers grains being Vietnam and Thailand. Access to diversified markets allows us to sell product to customers offering the highest net price.
 ﻿
 Our corn oil is sold primarily to biodiesel plants and, to a lesser extent, feedlot and poultry markets. We transport our corn oil by truck to locations in a close proximity to our ethanol plants primarily in the southeastern and midwestern regions of the United States. We also transport corn oil by rail and barges to national markets as well as to exporters for shipment on vessels to international markets.
 ﻿
 Through Green Plains Trade, we provide marketing services of natural gas to our ethanol plants and to other third parties including the procurement of both the pipeline capacity and natural gas. We also enhance the value by aggregating volumes at various storage facilities which can be sold to either the plants or various intermediary markets and end markets.    
 ﻿
 Our railcar fleet for the agribusiness and energy services segment consists of approximately 480 leased hopper cars to transport distillers grains and approximately 80 leased tank cars to transport corn oil and crude oil. The initial terms of the lease contracts are for periods up to ten years.    ﻿
 Food and Ingredients Segment
 ﻿
 Cattle feeding operations. Our cattle feeding operations have the capacity to support approximately 355,000 head of cattle and 11.7 million bushels of grain storage capacity.

  ﻿
 We purchase feeder cattle from producers, order buyers and livestock auctions, the majority of which are from Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. Generally, our feeder cattle are purchased at weights between 650 and 950 pounds. We typically feed the feeder cattle for approximately 175 days prior to selling to large beef processors at prices determined by the market, adjusted for quality. Bulk cattle commodities are traded on commodity exchanges. Inventory values are affected by changes in these markets and the spreads between feeder and live cattle futures.
 ﻿
 Vinegar operations. Fleischmann’s Vinegar is a liquid, natural specialty ingredients company serving a range of markets and end-use applications, including food and beverage flavoring ingredients, meat preservatives, antimicrobials, bio-herbicides, and cleaning products across the food, beverage, agricultural, industrial and consumer markets. Vinegar is sold primarily to major food industry participants, including leading branded food companies, private label food manufacturers and companies serving the foodservice channel. Vinegar products appeal to both food and non-food end market applications and are comprised of white distilled vinegar and numerous specialty vinegars, including balsamic, red wine, white wine, cider and other varietals for retail and industrial uses. On November 27, 2018, we sold Fleischmann’s Vinegar.
 ﻿
 Food-grade corn oil production. Our food-grade corn oil operations focus on shipping corn oil from facilities across the Midwest by rail or barge to terminal facilities located in the southern United States. Once the corn oil arrives at the terminal facility, it is unloaded and consolidated into set volumes and prepared for shipment by vessel. The corn oil is then shipped to independent refiners outside the United States for refining into a refined, bleached, dewaxed and deodorized food-grade product. This finished product is then shipped by vessel or container to our various customers. In addition, we also execute trade volumes of corn oil and soybean oil in both domestic and international markets.    ﻿
 Partnership Segment
 ﻿
 Our partnership segment provides fuel storage and transportation services through (i) 32 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 13 operational ethanol production plants and one non-operational ethanol production plant, (ii) seven fuel terminal facilities located near major rail lines, and (iii) a leased railcar fleet and other transportation assets. 
 ﻿

 Transportation and Delivery. Most of our ethanol plants are situated near major highways or rail lines to ensure efficient movement. We are able to move product from our ethanol plants to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge. We also manage the logistics and transportation requirements of our customers to improve our fleet’s efficiency and reduce operating costs. 
 ﻿
 Deliveries within 150 miles of our plants and the partnership’s fuel terminal facilities are generally transported by truck. Deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads, allowing our plants to ship product throughout the United States.
 ﻿
 To meet the challenge of marketing ethanol and distillers grains to diverse market segments, several of our plants are capable of simultaneously handling more than 150 railcars. Some of our locations have large loop tracks with unit train loading capabilities for both ethanol and dried distillers grains and spurs to connect the loop to the mainline or allow the movement and storage of railcars on site. 
 ﻿
 The partnership’s railcar fleet consists of approximately 2,840 leased tank cars for the transportation of ethanol. The initial terms of the railcar lease agreements range from one to five years.    ﻿
 To optimize the partnership’s railcar assets, we transport products other than ethanol depending on market opportunities and have used a portion of our railcar fleet to transport crude oil for third parties and to lease railcars to other users.
 ﻿
 Terminal and Distribution Services. Ethanol is transported from the partnership’s terminals to third-party terminal racks where it is blended with gasoline and transferred to the loading rack for delivery by truck to retail gas stations. The partnership owns and operates fuel holding tanks and terminals, and provide terminal services and logistics solutions to markets that do not have efficient access to renewable fuels. The partnership owns and operates fuel terminals at seven locations in six states with combined storage capacity of approximately 7.3 mmg and throughput capacity of approximately 762 mmgy. We also have 32 ethanol storage facilities located at or near our 13 operational ethanol production plants and one non-operational ethanol production plant with a combined storage capacity of approximately 31.9 mmg to support current ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.1 bgy.

 Our Competition 
 ﻿
 Domestic Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We are one of the largest consolidated owners’ of ethanol plants in the United States. We compete with other domestic ethanol producers in a relatively fragmented industry. Our competitors also include plants owned by farmers, cooperatives, oil refiners and retail fuel operators. These competitors may continue to operate their plants even when market conditions are not favorable due to the benefits realized from their other operations.
 ﻿
 As of January 15, 2019, the top five producers operated 69 plants and accounted for approximately 44% of the domestic production capacity with production capacities ranging from 800 mmgy to 1,700 mmgy. Approximately half of the 204 plants in the United States are standalone facilities and accounted for approximately 34% of domestic production capacity.
 ﻿
 Demand for corn from ethanol plants and other corn consumers exists in all areas and regions in which we operate. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, there were 123 operational plants in the states where we have production facilities, including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas, as of January 15, 2019. The largest concentration of operational plants is located in Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, where approximately 51% of all operational production capacity is located.
 ﻿
 Foreign Ethanol Competitors
 ﻿
 We also compete globally with production from other countries. Brazil is the second largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States. Brazil produces ethanol made from sugarcane, which may be less expensive to produce than ethanol made from corn depending on feedstock prices. Under RFS II, certain parties are obligated to meet an advanced biofuel standard. In recent years, sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil has been one of the most economical means for obligated parties to meet this standard. Any significant additional ethanol production capacity could create excess supply in world markets, resulting in lower ethanol prices throughout the world, including the United States. 
 ﻿
 Other Competition
 ﻿
 Alternative fuels, gasoline oxygenates and ethanol production methods are continually under development. Ethanol production technologies also continue to evolve. We expect changes to occur primarily in the area of cellulosic ethanol, which is made from biomass such as switch grass or fast-growing poplar trees. Since all of our plants are designed as single-feedstock facilities, adapting our plants for a different feedstock or process system would require additional capital investments and retooling which could be cost prohibitive.
 ﻿
 In addition, we compete with other cattle feeding operations in competitive markets. Following the recent acquisitions of the Leoti, Kansas, Eckley, Colorado, Sublette, Kansas and Tulia, Texas cattle-feeding operations, we now operate the fourth largest cattle-feeding operations in the United States.    ﻿
 Regulatory Matters    ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under the RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or environment.
 ﻿
 The RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When the RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of “conventional” corn-based ethanol to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 30, 2018, the EPA announced the final 2019 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target.
 ﻿

According to the RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2019 is the second consecutive year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator has directed his staff to initiate the reset rulemaking process, and the EPA will modify statutory volumes through 2022 based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022. These factors include environmental impact, domestic energy security, expected production, infrastructure impact, consumer costs, job creation, price of ag commodities, food prices, and rural economic development.
 ﻿
 Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. Higher RIN prices encourage more blending of ethanol.
 ﻿
 Under the RFS II, a small refinery, that processes less than 75,000 barrels per day, can petition the EPA for a waiver of their requirement to submit RINs. The EPA, through consultation with the Department of Energy and the Department of Agriculture, can grant them a full or partial waiver, or deny it within 90 days of submittal. The EPA granted significantly more of these waivers in 2016 and 2017 than they had in previous years, totaling 790 million gallons of waived requirements for 2016 and 1.46 billion gallons for 2017. This effectively reduced the RFS II mandated volumes for those compliance years by those amounts, and has lowered RIN values significantly over the past calendar year.
 ﻿
 Biofuels groups have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Federal District Court for the D.C. Circuit, challenging the 2019 RVO rule over the EPA’s failure to address small refinery exemptions in the rulemaking. This is the first RFS rulemaking since the expanded use of the exemptions came to light, however the EPA has refused to cap the number of waivers it grants or how it accounts for the retroactive waivers in its percentage standard calculations. The EPA has a statutory mandate to ensure the volume requirements are met, which are achieved by setting the percentage standards for obligated parties. The current approach accomplishes the opposite. Even if all the obligated parties comply with their respective percentage obligations for 2019, the nation’s overall supply of renewable fuel will not meet the total volume requirements set by the EPA. This undermines Congressional intent of demand pressure creation and an increased consumption of renewable fuels. Biofuels groups argue the EPA must therefore adjust its percentage standard calculations to make up for past retroactive waivers and adjust the standards to account for any waivers it reasonably expects to grant in the future.

 ﻿
 Environmental and Other Regulation
 ﻿
 Our ethanol production, agribusiness and energy services, food and ingredients, and partnership segment activities are subject to various and extensive environmental and other regulations. We obtain environmental permits to operate our plants and other facilities.
 ﻿
 Ethanol production involves the emission of various airborne pollutants, including particulate, carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, hazardous air pollutants and volatile organic compounds. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the Clean Air Act in a case seeking to require the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions, which the EPA later addressed in RFS II. 
 ﻿
 While some of our plants operate as grandfathered at their current authorized capacity under the RFS II mandate, expansion above these capacities will require a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement. This may require us to obtain additional permits, achieve the EPA’s efficient producer status under the pathway petition program for our grandfathered plants, install advanced technology or reduce drying distillers grains. 
 ﻿
 CARB adopted LCFS requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the State of California Office of Administrative Law approved the LCFS in November 2012, and revised LCFS regulations took effect in January 2013.
 ﻿
 We employ maintenance and operations personnel at each of our plants. In addition to the attention we place on the health and safety of our employees, the operations of our facilities are regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
