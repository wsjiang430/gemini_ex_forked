ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Mission
 
As electricity is a standard in every home and building, our mission is to make homes and buildings become safe advanced and smart as the standard.
Overview
 
Sky Technologies has a series of highly disruptive advanced-safe-smart platform technologies, with over 60 U.S. and global patents and patent pending applications. Our technologies place an emphasis on high quality and ease of use, while significantly enhancing both safety and lifestyle in homes and buildings. We believe that our products are a necessity in every room in both homes and other buildings in the U.S. and globally.
 
Our first-generation technologies enable light fixtures, ceiling fans and other electrically wired products to be installed safely and plugged in to a ceiling’s electrical outlet box within seconds, and without the need to touch hazardous wires. The plug and play technology method is a universal power-plug device that has a matching receptacle that is simply connected to the electrical outlet box on the ceiling, enabling a safe and quick plug and play installation of light fixtures and ceiling fans in just seconds. The plug and play power-plug technology eliminates the need of touching hazardous electrical wires while installing light fixtures, ceiling fans and other hard wired electrical products. In recent years, we have developed prototypes that expand the capabilities of our power-plug product, to include advanced safe and quick universal installation methods, as well as advanced smart capabilities, which are currently in the third and final prototype stage prior to launching. The smart features contained in the final prototype include control of light fixtures and ceiling fans by the SkyHome App, through WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) and voice control connections. The SkyHome App will allow scheduling, energy savings eco mode, dimming, back-up emergency light, night light, light color changing and much more.
 
We believe that due to safety, convenience, cost, and time that all hard-wired electrical products, such as light fixtures, ceiling fans and other products, should become plug and play and smart, as the standard, enabling consumers to plug their fixtures and control them through their smart phones at any time.
 
Our second-generation technology, which is in the second stage prototype, is an all-in-one safe and smart advanced platform (the “Smart Sky Platform”) that is designed to enhance all-around safety and lifestyle of homes and other buildings.
 
We believe that our patented advanced, safe and smart home platform technologies will enhance and promote safety in homes and buildings and make them smart, as a standard, in a fraction of the time and cost, as compared to other market products.
 
We believe that our smart home products will enable builders to deliver smart homes as a standard, in the same way they deliver electricity and appliances as a standard.
 
As our products, including our prototype advanced, safe and smart products, can be easily implemented and installed in both existing and new homes and buildings in just minutes, installing our products is expected to save a major part of the cost and time associated with installation of smart home products. As many people spend the majority of time at their homes, we believe that they should have an affordable, easily installed, standard solution to make their homes safe, secured and smart. Similar to how smartphones serve people as an all-in-one personal smart platform, we believe that our all-in-one Smart Sky Platform will enable every room in homes and other buildings to include a smart platform as a standard.
 
The Smart Sky Platform technology is an open system that can integrate with both existing and new smart home features, devices, and systems. The Smart Sky Platform prototype is designed and built in a way that it can accommodate additional smart home features, enabling the platform to serve as a gateway for safe and smart technologies into rooms/homes, buildings, and that it can act like a “Panama-Canal” that can accommodate other type of software systems, wireless systems, electronic chips and more.

Since 2015, we have generated over $29 million in sales from our standard products, which include ceiling fans and light fixtures with our standard “plug and play” feature built in and are described further below under “Products—Our First Product: The Weight Bearing Power-Plug”. We have decided to wind down the sales of our standard products by discontinuing production of light fixtures and ceiling fans that include the older version of our standard Sky Plug & Receptacle in favor of launching our new line of products, which are in the third and final prototype stage prior to launching and include a universal “plug and play” adapter kit, our smart products, which will include smart light fixtures and ceiling fans with our smart “plug and play” features, and our Smart Sky Platform. Additional information regarding our new line of products is described below under “Products—Advanced Products” and “—Smart Products.” We elected to do so since we believe that the market has great demand for smart advanced products, and that we will be able to generate significant sales from our new line of advanced and smart products from direct sales as well as from licensing. Our first generation of advanced and smart products are in the third and final prototype stage prior to launching. We expect that all advanced and smart products will be commercially available during 2023. As part of the launch of certain products, we have allowed customers to pre-order prior to general availability.
 
Recent Developments
 
On February 6, 2023 (the “Signing Date”), we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the stockholders (the “Sellers”) of Belami, a California corporation, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Belami from the Sellers (the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, the “Acquisition”). Belami is a strategic e-commerce lighting and home décor conglomerate that the Company expects will serve as a marketing and growth platform and will provide several distribution channels, including to retail customers, builders and professionals.
 
At the closing of the Acquisition (the “Acquisition Closing”), Belami’s stock will transfer to the Company, and the Company will pay to the Sellers as consideration (i) $7.0 million in cash, net of indebtedness (other than permitted indebtedness), transaction expenses (as provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement), and bonuses to certain employees and consultants, and the release to Sellers of a $1.0 million payment held in escrow, which the Company paid into escrow on the Signing Date, and (ii) 2,018,692 shares of the Company’s common stock, no par value (the “common stock”), which is equal to $6.48 million divided by $3.21, which is the average closing price per share of the common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the Signing Date. The Company will also pay to the Sellers, on the first anniversary of the Acquisition Closing date (the “Deferred Payment Date”), (i) $3.22 million in cash and (ii) a number of shares of common stock equal to approximately $6.4 million divided by the average closing price per share of the common stock on Nasdaq for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the Deferred Payment Date, subject to a minimum price per share of $3.00 and a maximum price per share of $4.00. The deferred payment will be increased or decreased by the amount of a working capital adjustment, as provided for in the Stock Purchase Agreement, and will be subject to offset for indemnification claims. Any payment of the working capital adjustment by the Company will be paid one-third in cash and two-thirds in common stock, equal to such adjustment amount divided by the average closing price per share of common stock on Nasdaq for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the date of the post-closing adjustment, up to 100,000 shares of common stock (with any additional amount to be paid in cash).
 
In addition, prior to the Acquisition Closing, an amount of cash equal to Belami’s retained earnings is required to be distributed to the Sellers. If the amount of cash distributed is insufficient, the Company will be required to deliver a promissory note to Sellers at the Acquisition Closing equal to the difference between retained earnings and the cash distributed, with a term of one year and an interest rate equal to the short-term applicable federal rate then in effect. The Company also agreed to assume Belami’s loan agreement with PNC Bank, National Association, consisting of a $2.0 million revolving line of credit and a term loan of approximately $2.5 million.

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company closed private placement offerings (the “Private Placements”) pursuant to securities purchase agreements with certain existing Company investors, providing for the issuance and sale by the Company to such investors of (i) subordinated secured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10.35 million and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,391,667 shares of the Company’s common stock for certain investors. The proceeds will be used for the cash component of the Acquisition consideration and to pay certain transaction expenses in connection with the Acquisition and the Private Placements.
 
In March 2023, the Company also acquired 50% of the equity of a strategic e-commerce private label lighting website, for $225,000. The other 50% of the equity is owned by Belami. The Company expects that this acquisition will serve as another marketing and growth platform for the Company and will provide additional distribution to both professional and retail channels for the Company’s products.
 
Safety
 
We believe that safety is a necessity and the top priority in all aspects of life. Therefore, our technologies and products emphasize human safety, home, building and property safety and security, while combining safety features with high demand smart home features. We believe our products should contribute to the elimination of many cases of hazardous incidents, including ladder falls, electric shock/electrocutions, fires, carbon monoxide poisonings, injuries and deaths, as management believes that our products will result in easier installment processes and enhance the use of life saving products such as smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and emergency lights, among other products. Our products, including the Smart Sky Platform’s second-generation prototype, incorporate our “plug and play” technology, which eliminates the need to touch wires during the later plug-in install, replacement and maintenance, and cleaning and, accordingly, could result in reduced incidents of electrical shocks and fires resulting from faulty wiring. The installation of our products and retrofitting of electrical services does not require the services of a licensed electrician but does not preclude the services of a licensed electrician. As more individuals engage in do-it-yourself (DIY) lighting projects, using our products rather than traditional lighting products could reduce incidents of incorrect wiring, shocks, injury and even death. In addition, we believe installing our products will allow installers to spend less time on a ladder during initial installation. Installers often wire light fixtures and fans while also holding such fixture or fan; with our products, including the Smart Sky Platform, the initial receptacle installation will be completed on the ladder and, afterwards, the fixture can simply be plugged into place, resulting in a faster and, we believe, much safer process, as installers can focus on wiring without also holding potentially heavy or breakable fixtures. Further, the Smart Sky Platform will incorporate a hard-wired smoke detector with battery back-up and a carbon monoxide monitor, which we believe could reduce injuries and deaths from fire and carbon monoxide poisoning.
Products
 
Our products are designed to improve all around home and building safety and lifestyle. While we have developed and created working prototypes of our advanced and smart products, as described below, we are continuing to refine the product prototypes and expect that all advanced and smart products will be commercially available during 2023.
Our First Product: The Weight Bearing Power-Plug
 
Our first patented technology was the Power-Plug, a weight bearing power plug that acts as a safe and quick installation device, designed for “plug and play” installation of weight bearing electronics, such as light fixtures, ceiling fans and other electrical products, into ceiling electrical outlet boxes.
 
Our patented technology consists of a fixable socket and a revolving plug (the Power-Plug) for conducting electric power and supporting an electrical appliance attached to a wall or ceiling. The socket is comprised of a non-conductive body that houses conductive rings connectable to an electric power supply through terminals in its side exterior. The Power-Plug, which is comprised of a non-conductive body that houses corresponding conductive rings, attaches to the socket via a male post and can feed electric power to an appliance. The Power-Plug also includes a second structural element allowing it to revolve with a releasable latch that, when engaged, provides a retention force between the socket and the Power-Plug to prevent disengagement. The socket and Power-Plug can be detached by releasing the latch, disengaging the electric power from the Power-Plug. The socket is designed to replace the support bar incorporated in electric junction boxes, and the Power-Plug can be installed in light fixtures, ceiling fans, wall sconce fixtures and other electrical devices and products. Once installed, the socket can remain affixed to the junction box, enabling any electronic fixture installed with the Power-Plug to be connected and/or removed in seconds. The combined socket and Power-Plug technology are referred to throughout this Form 10-K as the “Sky Plug & Receptacle”.

Sustainability
 
We aim to provide safe and sustainable solutions to consumers, who increasingly consider sustainability and energy efficiency when purchasing products. We believe that creating sustainable products and streamlining our operations drives efficiency, innovation and, ultimately, long-term value-creation. In designing and improving our products, we consider and apply sustainability strategies, as appropriate. For example, our products’ features include an energy savings economical mode, which can help users reduce their energy consumption, and we generally use LED lighting in our ceiling fans and light fixtures, which is more energy-efficient than traditional lighting products.
Cyber Security
 
We have implemented measures and protocols to ensure that our users’ information is safe and fully protected. We use high level of cyber security measures and protocols to ensure that our software, technologies, servers, products, platform, and devices are all protected to prevent any type of unauthorized or illegal access or interference to our software, technologies, servers, products, platforms, and devices.
 
Our products, platforms and devices communicate over MQTT and are encrypted over Transport Layer Security, with each individual product, platform and device having its own set of certificates, keys, and universally unique identifiers, which ensures that each device can only communicate with its own topic. This ensures that even in extreme cases of illegally gaining control over a specific device, it will not affect any other devices.
 
Each login to the platform generates the user a temporary token that grants access to the services for a limited amount of time, which ensures that there is no permanent access token that can be used by hackers for unauthorized access. Each token has permissions to access only the user’s resources.
 
Our solutions are designed in a way that the user will need to conduct a restricted set of permissions, thus minimizing the risk of unwanted users gaining control over other locations.
 
Sky Plug & Receptacle – NEC Code
 
The NEC (National Electrical Code) is the U.S. electrical safety building code, and is the benchmark for safe electrical design, installation, and inspection to protect people and property from electrical hazards. It has been adopted in some form in all 50 states in the United States and is intended to improve safety in U.S. homes and buildings.
 
Based on the safety aspects of the Sky Plug & Receptacle, it was voted into the NEC and is represented by 10 different segments in the NEC Code Book. The Company has provided data relating to safety aspects of its receptacle as to electrocutions, fires and ladder falls to NEC.
 
One of the key votes and segments relating to our technologies in the NEC Code Book was the change of the definition of “receptacle” in the Code Book, which we believe is one of the most significant additions to the NEC in the past 120 years. The NEC leads the United States and globally with respect to electrical safety standards; as such, we believe the reputable standards of the NEC can assist with the adoption of our technology in additional countries.
 
Pursuant to these NEC provisions, the Sky Plug & Receptacle enables builders to expedite and obtain a Certificate of Occupancy without the need to install a light fixture to the ceiling.
 
During the third quarter of 2022, the Company received NEC generic name approval for its weight-bearing safe plug and play outlet/receptacle for ceilings as WSCR (Weight-Supporting Ceiling Receptacle) for its universal ceiling outlet and WSAF (Weight-Supporting Attachment Fitting) for its ceiling plug. The specifications for the WSCR and WSAF received a standardization approval vote by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), leading U.S. standardization organizations. The American National Standards Institute’s and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association’s vote for the standardization of the Company’s weightbearing plug and outlet/receptacle for ceilings does not guarantee approval by the National Fire Protection Association’s (NFPA) Committee on the National Electrical Code (which consists of multiple code-making panels and a technical correlating committee and develops the National Electrical Code (NEC)) or any other trade or regulatory organization and does not guarantee that any of the Company’s products will become NEC mandatory in any jurisdiction, or that any of the Company’s current or future products or technologies will be adopted by any state, country, or municipality, within any specific timeframe or at all.

Intellectual Property
 
Developing and maintaining a strong intellectual property position is one of the most important elements of our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trademarks, and trade secret laws, as well as confidential procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties. We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection for our technology and for improvements to our technology, as well as for any of our other technologies where we believe such protection will be advantageous. In addition, certain intellectual property and proprietary information held by a third party is central to our products and technologies. If we lose our rights to use such intellectual property and proprietary information in the future, our business or operating results and our ability to complete could be adversely impacted.
 
We protect our intellectual property through various aspects and strategies including broad and particular intellectual property claims. We have over 60 U.S. and global patents and patent applications, including in China, India, and Europe as well in other countries around the world. These patents and patent applications protect different aspects of our technologies. We sought intellectual property protection of our technologies in China due to our current manufacturing operations and prospective sales in China’s market, and we sought protection in India in anticipation of future growth into India’s developing market, both with respect to the sales of our products and our potential operations. As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S., we owned seven issued patents, which expire from 2036 to 2038, and six pending or published but not yet issued patents, and outside of the U.S., we owned eight issued patents, which expire from 2026 to 2039, and 46 pending or published but not yet issued patents. We intend to diligently maintain and vigorously defend the intellectual property of Sky Technologies, and to enhance our patent protections actively and continuously in the U.S. and globally.
 
The issued patents are directed to various aspects our platform technologies, including our smart and standard plug and play products, as well as our safe and smart platform technologies. As further innovations are developed, we intend to seek additional patent protection to enhance and maintain our competitive advantage. Additionally, we have submitted 10 trademark applications, seven of which have been issued and three of which are pending.

On June 15, 2011, we entered into the License Agreement with GE, pursuant to which we have the right to market certain ceiling light and fan fixtures displaying the GE brand. We and GE subsequently amended the License Agreement, including on April 17, 2013, August 13, 2014, September 25, 2018, May 2019 and December 1, 2020. The License Agreement imposes certain manufacturing and quality control conditions that we must maintain to continue to use the GE brand. The License Agreement is nontransferable and cannot be sublicensed. Various termination clauses are applicable to the License Agreement; however, none were applicable as of December 31, 2022.
 
On August 13, 2014, we entered into a second amendment to the License Agreement pertaining to our royalty obligations. Under the initial terms of the amendment, we agreed to pay GE a minimum trademark license fee of $12.0 million by November 30, 2018 (the “Initial Royalty Obligation”) for the rights assigned in the original contract. The amendment provided that, if we did not pay to GE royalties equal to the Initial Royalty Obligation over the term of the License Agreement, we would owe the difference to GE in December 2018.
 
We are expanding our relationship with GE to collaborate on mutual capabilities, and in December 2020, we entered into the current amendment to the License Agreement. The amendments following the second amendment expanded our product range, including smart, and added additional global territory rights. The License Agreement has been extended for an additional five years and expires on November 30, 2023. Pursuant to the third amendment, entered September 2018, the approximate remaining payment of $10.0 million pursuant to the Initial Royalty Obligation was waived, and we agreed to pay GE an aggregate amount of $6.0 million, consisting of three annual installments of $2.0 million to be paid to GE in each of December 2018, 2019 and 2020. In December 2020, we restructured the royalty payment obligations due of approximately $4.4 million, plus $0.7 million in interest. We agreed to pay a total of $5.1 million to GE in quarterly installments through December 2023, including $100,000 due December 2020, an aggregate of $500,000 due in four equal installments in 2021, an aggregate of $1.2 million due in four equal installments in 2022 and an aggregate of $3.3 million due in four equal installments in 2023 (the “Minimum Payments”). In the event the Company receives significant funding rounds of at least $50.0 million in funding, it is required to use a portion of such funding to pay certain amounts to GE. The Minimum Payments will be in addition to the royalty payments made to GE during the respective year, as set forth below.
 
Royalty payments are due quarterly, using a December 1 – November 30 contract year and based upon the prior quarter’s sales. Royalty payments will be paid from sales of GE branded product subject to the following repayment schedule:

Following commercial launch of our advanced and smart products, we plan to educate retail and commercial consumers about our products through a coordinated public relation campaign that will cover the safety aspects of our products and all the related hazardous incidents and property damage that our products can prevent, including ladder falls, electric shock/electrocutions, fires, carbon monoxide poisonings, injuries, deaths and more.
 
We will also educate on all our advanced smart technology features.
 
We believe our total addressable market in the United States exceeds $500 billion, based on the Company’s internal calculations derived from the estimation of the total target user pool, projected average selling price, and projected units per household. We believe there are billions of installations of light and other electrical fixtures globally. Our estimates of the addressable market for our products may prove to be incorrect. The projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand. Even if the total addressable market for our products is as large as we have estimated and even if we are able to gain market awareness and acceptance, we may not be able to penetrate the existing market to capture additional market share.
 
Lead and Seed Strategy: We expect to lead by selling our highly disruptive line of products through a variety of channels as well as seed our products through licensing to various industries.
 

● | Lead Through Direct Sales: We expect to sell our products through various representatives to online customers, builders, rental properties, hotels, big box retail, OEM customers and more. We expect to sell our products to personal consumers primarily through direct sales via our website, to large retailers, distributors and dealers, and through warehouse programs. We plan to rely primarily on product distribution arrangements with third parties and expect that our multi-channel sales strategy will evolve and expand in the future. We expect our primary customers to be retail consumers, retail showrooms, builders residential/commercial, hotels, OEM and licensing.

● | Seed Through Licensing: After our public relation campaign and our official product launch, we expect to license a variety of our standard and smart products to companies in various industries, including electrical companies, lighting and ceiling fan companies, as well as smart home companies. We intend to expand our sales and marketing operations and activities and intend to build strong customer relationships and expand our brand awareness. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of our sales campaign, we intend to use online channels and may also utilize social media influencers. As part of the launch of certain products, we have allowed, and may in the future allow customers to pre-order prior to general availability. Our future revenue streams may also include data aggregation and subscriptions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our operations or activities, gain market awareness or acceptance of our products, or achieve our expectations described above.
 
Product Usage
 
Our products and technologies can be used in new and existing homes and buildings, including by builders, rental properties, hotels, cruise ships, elder living facilities, schools, hospitals, offices, commercial, and retail. We provide a one-year full performance warranty on all our products, as well as part replacements. We intend to provide extended warranty coverage plans in the future.

Our product is intended to help prevent most of related ladder falls, electric shock/electrocutions, fires, carbon monoxide poisonings, injuries, and deaths.
 

● | Ceiling Fan Industry: We believe that due to the ease of installation, time savings, cost savings on installations and the safety aspect of our product, our product is a necessity for the ceiling fan industry. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that all ceiling fans should become plug and play, smart and controlled by an app as a standard, and that ceiling fans should be installed to the ceiling within seconds, safely and without the need to touch dangerous electrical wires. Our product is intended to help prevent most of related ladder falls, electric shock/electrocutions, fires, carbon monoxide poisonings, injuries, and deaths.
 

● | Smart Home Industry: We believe that due to ease of the installation, time savings, cost savings on installations and the safety aspect of our product, our product is a necessity for the smart home industry. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe that homes and buildings should become safe and smart as a standard. Our Advanced All-In-One Safe Smart Sky Platform enables rooms, homes, and buildings to become safe and smart.
 
Our Advanced Smart Sky Platform significantly enhances smart home products’ performance, including the speed and range of both WIFI and Bluetooth, as well as the performance of sensors and alarms. We believe that widespread adoption of the Smart Sky Platform should contribute to the elimination of most related hazardous incidents in homes and buildings including ladder falls, electric shock/electrocutions, fires, carbon monoxide poisonings, injuries, and deaths. Therefore, we believe our product is a necessity in rooms, homes, and buildings.
 
Our Advanced All-In-One Safe Smart Sky Platform can be used in existing homes and buildings, by builders, rental properties, hotels, cruise ships, elder living facilities, schools, hospitals, offices, commercial, retail and other.
 
We launched our new universal power plug, our SkyHome App, and our smart universal plug, as well as the smart ceiling fans and lighting fixtures containing such plug, in December 2022. Bringing our products to market will require us to take certain steps, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

Manufacturing: While we have manufactured and sold our prior products and intend to continue to use the third-party manufacturers with which we have an ongoing relationship, we have not yet begun manufacturing our new advanced or smart products. We expect it may take approximately 90 days to complete manufacturing of our new universal power plug and/or our smart universal plug after we place an order. However, it may take longer than expected due to, among other things, difficulties finding suppliers, shipping delays resulting in late deliveries of necessary supplies and materials, chip shortages and geopolitical matters.

● | Marketing and Public Relations: We will need to gain brand awareness and attract customers. In connection with our product launch, we plan to educate retail and commercial consumers about our products through a coordinated public relation campaign that will cover the safety aspects of our products and all the related hazardous incidents and property damage that our products can contribute to preventing, as well as our advanced smart technology features. We currently rely, and plan to rely primarily, on product distribution arrangements with third parties. We expect to enter in additional sales, distribution and/or licensing agreements in the future, and we may not be able to enter into these agreements on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. We may also need to hire additional sales personnel.

Expected Revenue Stream
 
We believe our products will enable us to access a global market with multiple revenue streams, including:
 

● | Global market with numerous potential product applications 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Product sales 
● | Royalties/Licensing 
● | Subscription model 
● | Monitoring services 
● | Sale of product and licensing rights to additional countries 

 
Royalties from the Sky Plug & Receptacle. Management has agreed to license products in the U.S. and globally through the efforts of its GE licensing and trademark agreements. We anticipate we will also license our smart technologies products currently in development.
 
Selling/Licensing Country Rights. Management is considering selling and licensing marketing rights to certain countries in exchange for payment and on-going royalties.
 
Product Sales. We currently generate revenue from our product sales, and management will strive to achieve strong market penetration worldwide for our current products and products in development. We have previously sold our standard products in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and expect to begin selling our new smart products in these markets in 2023. We intend to expand our sales footprint in certain countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We may be unable to gain market acceptance in such markets and cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to expand our market reach.
 
Subscription & Monitoring Services. Our future plans include offering subscription services as part of our Smart Sky Platform, including, among other services, communications, fire alarms, home intrusion alerts, emergency response services and monitoring services. Our smart platform will include, among other features, a smart smoke detector, a smart carbon monoxide detector, and a WIFI extender. We intend to expand our operations to enable us to provide services relating to these functions, including high-speed internet services, monitoring systems designed to sense movement, smoke, fire, carbon monoxide, temperature, and other environmental conditions and hazards, monitor home access and visitors and address personal emergencies such as injuries and other medical emergencies. We intend to market such services to homeowners and other types of facilities, including rental properties, hotels, cruise ships, elder living facilities, schools, hospitals, offices, commercial, and retail. Our ability to provide such services will depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, subscriber interest and financial resources, any applicable licensing and regulatory compliance, our ability to manage our anticipated expansion and to hire, train and retain personnel, and general economic conditions. We may partner with other businesses to provide such services. We expect to begin providing such services in 2023 but cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so.

Our History
 
We began in 2004 and started developing the Sky Plug & Receptacle technology in 2007 for installation of light fixtures and ceiling fans during manufacturing and as a Retrofit Kit for installing the Sky Technology in existing light fixtures and ceiling fans. Historically, we have sold hundreds of thousands of units of the Sky Plug & Receptacle technology through original equipment manufacturing and through other channels to lighting manufacturers and retailers who installed the Sky Plug & Receptacle technology into their lighting fixtures for sale at retail stores. We also sold, directly to retailers, approximately hundreds of thousands of Sky Plugs & Receptacles embedded with ceiling fans.
 
Since our inception, we have sold hundreds of thousands of units of our standard Sky Plug & Receptacle. Since 2015 we generated over $29 million in sales. We have wound down our standard product sales by discontinuing production of light fixtures and ceiling fans that include the older version of our standard Sky Plug & Receptacle, in favor of licensing our product and developing our Smart Power-Plug and Smart Sky Platform technologies.
 
We hold over 60 U.S. and global patents and patent applications and have received a variety of final electrical code approvals, including UL, United Laboratories for Canada (cUL) and Conformité Européenne (CE), and 2017 and 2020 inclusion in the NEC Code Book.
 
Third-Party Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
Our business model entails the use of third-party manufacturers to produce the Sky Technology product. The manufacturers currently used by us are in China and, with respect to products that bear the GE logo, as required by the Licensing Agreement with GE, such manufacturers must be approved by GE to ensure certain quality standards are met. To further ensure that quality specifications are maintained, we maintain an office in the Guangdong province in China that is staffed with GE trained auditors who regularly inspect the products that are being produced by third-party manufacturers.
 
Raw materials used in our products include copper, aluminum, zinc, steel, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic and wood. We also purchase integrated circuit chip sets or other electronic components from third-party suppliers or rely on third-party independent contractors, some of which are customized or custom made for us. While we have experienced shortages in obtaining necessary materials, including zinc, copper and steel, as well as integrated circuit chips to be used in our products, we have been able to make other arrangements and find additional suppliers as necessary. With respect to circuit chips, we believe we have obtained enough to manufacture our products by the anticipated launch date. Going forward, we believe we can obtain more chips and other materials as needed within a reasonable time period and may be able to replace components with different products or modify our design if necessary. Geopolitical matters may also impact our manufacturing.
 
Our principal suppliers are Mei Pin Metal & Electrical Co., Ltd (Guangdong, China), Siterwell Electronics Co., Ltd (Zhejiang, China), Zhongshan Paragon Source Lighting Co., Ltd. (Noble) (Zhongshan, Guangdong, China), Artisan Industrial Co., Ltd. (Jiangmen, Guangdong, China) and Youngo Limited (Aircool) (Huizhou City, Guangdong, China).

Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Although not legally required to do so, we strive to obtain certifications for substantially all our products, both in the United States, and, where appropriate, in jurisdictions outside the United States. Products certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (“NRTL”), such as UL, Intertek Testing Lab (ETL) or Canadian Standards (CSA), bear a certification mark signifying that the product complies with the requirements of the product safety standard. UL Standards are used for evaluation of USA products, CSA Standards for Canada and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) Standards for European countries. We use UL as our main third-party NRTL safety laboratory. While we have received a variety of safety certifications on our products, including UL, United Laboratories for Canada (cUL), Conformité Européenne (CE) and IECEE Certification Body (CB) scheme, we may need or desire to obtain additional certifications for new product configurations, which will increase the time and costs to complete our product launches and which we may be unable to obtain within a reasonable time, or at all. In addition, certain electronic products require Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) certification, and we have obtained FCC certification on applicable products to ensure electromagnetic interference compliance. Although we believe that our broad knowledge and experience with electrical codes and safety standards have facilitated certification approvals, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain any such certifications for our new products or that, if certification standards are amended, we will be able to maintain such certifications for our existing products.
 
Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such as fluorescent lighting, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products. We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future.
