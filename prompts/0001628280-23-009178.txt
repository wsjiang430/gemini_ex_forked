ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Evolv Technologies Holdings, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Evolv”) is a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)-based weapons detection for security screening. Our mission is to make the world a safer and more enjoyable place to live, work, learn, and play. We are democratizing security by making it seamless for facility operators to address the chronic epidemic of escalating gun violence, mass shootings and terrorist attacks in a cost-effective manner while improving the visitor experience.
Unlike traditional walk-through metal detectors, our touchless security screening solutions use AI software, software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) cloud services, and advanced sensors to reliably detect weapons that could be a threat to a crowd of visitors while significantly reducing nuisance alarms from harmless personal items. This means that visitors can walk through our solution without stopping, without removing personal items from their pockets or bags, and without having to form a single file line. Our products significantly reduce the number of false positive alarms, allowing security staff to focus their attention on high probability threats.
Our innovative technology not only enhances security but makes screening up to ten times faster at up to a 70% lower total cost than traditional alternatives. Our products also deliver a largely touchless screening experience — a capability that has become an increasingly important consumer demand. Our products also provide unique analytic insights about security screening performance and visitor flows. Our products, which are offered to our customers primarily under a multi-year subscription pricing model, deliver both excellent value to our customers and predictable revenue streams for us.
We are focused on delivering value in the spaces in and around the physical threshold of venues and facilities. We believe that digitally transforming the visitor experience at the entry point to venues and facilities will be a critically important innovation in physical security. We believe that our solutions will not only make venues and facilities safer and more enjoyable, but also more efficient, more informed about their visitors’ needs, and ultimately more profitable.
Our touchless security screening systems have screened over 500 million visitors worldwide since our inception. We believe that we have screened more visitors through advanced AI-based detection systems in the United States than any organization, other than the United States Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”). Our customers include many iconic venues across a wide variety of industries, including major sports stadiums and arenas, notable performing arts and entertainment venues, major tourist destinations and cultural attractions, hospitals, large industrial workplaces, schools, and prominent houses of worship. We offer our products for lease or purchase and utilize a multi-year security-as-a-service subscription pricing model that delivers ongoing value to customers, generates predictable revenue and creates expansion and upsell opportunities.
Our Industry
We believe that most people associate security screening with airports, courthouses, and prisons. These facilities represent a small fraction of the total number of gathering spaces where mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and other forms of armed violence might occur, but they have historically had a disproportionate impact on the design and implementation of security screening technology. These specialized facilities are typically required by law to meet specific screening regulations using products built to meet technical standards designed for these environments. Many of these standards and regulations were designed in the pre-digital era of the last century.
Regulated facilities like airports and prisons usually have a local monopoly on the services they provide and therefore have historically been incentivized to emphasize technical regulatory compliance at the expense of the visitor experience. Security technology providers have historically focused on serving this regulated market and developed technology that meets the regulatory requirements, but without regard to the visitor experience. This limited functionality has unfortunately led many unregulated facilities to avoid security screening altogether rather than run the risk of creating a prison-like visitor experience for their valued customers and employees. We believe that forcing venues to choose between better security and an enjoyable visitor experience is unacceptable. We believe the solution is to deliver technology that provides both.
Table of Contents

Security screening at most venues and facilities has historically been designed around metal detectors that require visitors to enter in single-file lines after submitting their bags and pocket contents to manual inspection. This process is usually supported by multiple security guards who perform manual bag inspections, hand wand scans, and hands-on body ‘pat downs’ to resolve the large numbers of alarms, frequently false positives, generated by the metal detectors. This complex process has numerous shortcomings such as nuisance alarm fatigue, ambiguous alarms, frequent human error, frustrating delays, invasive contact, high labor costs, transient security staff, and lack of data insights.
The historical emphasis on technical detection performance using outdated standards tested in isolation has drawn attention away from performance of the screening process as a whole system. Legacy screening technologies effectively detect metal, but they also generate numerous false alarms for harmless items. To bring down the false alarm rate, security teams proactively divert personal items away from the metal detectors into manual bag check processes that are vulnerable to human frailty and relatively easy for a determined attacker to defeat. The result is a slow, frustrating process that fails to deliver the security it promises. The root causes are outdated technical standards, old analog technology, and the inability of humans to fully compensate for these deficiencies.
Our touchless security screening technology overcomes the limitations of legacy security screening methods and processes. We define touchless security screening as a screening process that reliably detects weapons and other threats in a way that allows most people to enter venues and facilities while walking at a normal pace together with their party, without requiring manual bag or body inspections. Touchless security screening provides a range of benefits including reliable precision, automated and targeted, high throughput, non-invasive, reduced visitor anxiety, improved security staff experience, cost effective, reduced physical footprint, continuous improvement, and analytic insights.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that the current macro trends in firearms ownership, mass shootings, and pandemic awareness suggest that the need for effective security screening processes has never been greater and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.
In the United States, there are over 460 million privately-owned guns in circulation. According to the Gun Violence Archive, in 2022 there were close to 700 mass shootings in the United States.
Based on our experience with customers, we believe that consumers are and will remain uncomfortable with traditional high-touch security screening processes. We believe that visitors and security staff alike will continue to prefer a fully touchless security screening process in the future.
We believe that many venues and facilities have reluctantly chosen to operate without security screening because of the inherent shortcomings of old screening methods like walk through metal detectors. Due to these macro trends, we believe that venues and facilities that already conduct security screening will feel increasingly compelled to consider alternatives. Further, we believe that venues and facilities that have previously chosen not to implement security screening due to concerns about cost, effectiveness, or visitor experience impact will feel increasingly compelled to introduce security screening for the first time.
We believe our market opportunity has both a security screening opportunity as well as an adjacent market expansion opportunity as follows:
Security Screening Opportunity
We estimate that our primary market opportunity is for weapon screening at venues and facilities in the following segments:
•Educational Institutions,
•Hospitals & Health Care Facilities,
•Professional Sports Venues,
•Industrial Warehouses,
Table of Contents

•Distribution Facilities,
•Large Workplaces,
•Arts & Entertainment Venues,
•Government Offices,
•Hospitality Facilities, and
•Houses of Worship.
Using a variety of published industry reports and government data, we estimate that the above facilities together comprise nearly 400,000 sites and nearly 700,000 individual thresholds where our security screening products could potentially be deployed. We estimate that this market represents over $20 billion in potential weapon screening system sales annually.
Most venues and facilities in our target segments do not fall under government regulations that mandate the adoption of security screening systems that conform to specific standards. We estimate that these unregulated facilities represent over 90% of the total worldwide market opportunity for security screening technology and represent the best opportunity for rapid adoption of our innovative weapon screening products.
Our Growth Strategy
The key elements of our growth strategy within our target market include the following:
•Lead with our "Pure Subscription" Sales Model
During the year ending December 31, 2023, we intend to begin exclusively leading with our "pure subscription" sales model, where the customer leases our hardware, as opposed to purchasing the hardware outright, and enters into a multi-year security-as-a-service subscription. The pure subscription model aligns more closely with the SaaS nature of our business and results in a more predictable and consistent recurring revenue stream as compared to the purchase subscription model. However, we recognize that some end-user customers will still prefer to purchase our hardware outright. To this end, in March 2023, we entered into a distributor licensing agreement with Columbia Tech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Coghlin Companies, who currently serves as our primary contract manufacturer. Under this arrangement, we have granted a license of our intellectual property to Columbia Tech, and Columbia Tech will contract directly with certain of our resellers to fulfill sales demand where the end-user customer requires the contract to be in form of a hardware purchase. Columbia Tech will pay us a hardware license fee for each system sold under this agreement. In these instances, we will still contract directly with the reseller to provide a multi-year security-as-a-service subscription to the end-users.
•Develop Initial Customer Successes in Specific Target Metropolitan Areas
Decision-makers at our prospective customers are often professionally connected to decision-makers at other prospective customers in different vertical industries within a specific target metropolitan area. We have established a successful pattern of targeting and winning lighthouse customers in specific vertical industries and then leveraging that success to solicit referrals at other venues and facilities across the metropolitan area in other vertical industries. We have developed a playbook for executing this pattern through orchestration of our direct sales resources and channel partners in a manner that we believe will continue to scale as we develop the available market.
•Expand and Activate Our Channel Strategy
We have a global distribution network consisting of dozens of value-added resellers. This includes market leaders such as Motorola Solutions, STANLEY Securitas, and Johnson Controls, as well as smaller regional resellers. STANLEY Security, which was acquired by Securitas, was also an early investor in the Company. We intend to continue to develop our distribution network by adding further geographic coverage and sales

capacity based upon demand. We plan to continue to cultivate field level collaboration between our direct sales team and our resellers to develop the ability of the resellers to find, develop, close, and service customers independently.
•Concentrate Marketing and Sales Effort in Specific Target Accounts in Specific Vertical Industries
Through our experience to date we have developed a proprietary list of target vertical industries, developed a list of target accounts within those industries, and identified target decision-makers in our target accounts. We believe that our target account list represents the best immediate growth opportunities for our business. Over time we plan to adjust our target account list to reflect current market conditions and the capabilities of our products. We plan to continue to execute advertising, content marketing, lead generation, and sales development activities to our target account list to create qualified sales opportunities.
•Promote Awareness by Gathering and Leveraging Our Customer Community
Our business model presents significant opportunities to bring incremental value to existing customers over time. We intend to realize this value by seeking referrals from existing customers and partners to other prospective qualified customers, selling additional capacity to existing customers, and selling new add-on products and services to existing customers. We are continuing to develop and expand our customer success function within the global revenue organization to focus on helping customers successfully deploy our products and cultivate referrals, expansion, and upsell opportunities. We are also investing in programs to help our customers connect with each other to share best practices on a regional and vertical industry basis. Our buyers are naturally collaborative on security best practices due to their vested interest in collective deterrence and the likelihood that any security event will have a negative collective impact at the metropolitan, regional, or industry level.
Competition
We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from a number of companies, including other vendors of security screening systems. A variety of security screening technologies compete with our proprietary technologies, including, but not limited to walk-through metal detectors, handheld metal detector wands, and passive or active weapon screening systems based on magnetic field sensing, millimeter wave or terahertz imaging technology.
We believe that we are well-positioned to compete in our industry based on these core competencies and on the following competitive strengths:
•Unmatched Detection Effectiveness Based on Artificial Intelligence Software
Based on feedback from our customers, we believe that real-world screening operations based on our products detect more actual weapon threats with fewer nuisance alarms than similar screening operations based on old walk-through metal detectors. Our solutions use digital processing and artificial intelligence to differentiate between real weapon threats and harmless items like cell phones and keys. The Evolv Cortex AI™ software platform provides the digital brain of our solutions. Unlike analog alternatives, our solutions classify threats based on classification models that improve over time as we process more real-world data. Evolv Cortex AI also makes it possible to integrate new kinds of sensors and data sources and integrate our solutions with other platforms and applications.
•Large and Growing Data Set
The vast amounts of data collected by our products during each screening process constitute a large and diverse repository of digital machine learning training data for weapons and common non-threat items. This proprietary data set is essential in training our software to accurately classify a broad set of threats and non-threats under a wide variety of real-world conditions. We expect that this data set will continue to grow as our products are deployed in more venues and facilities. As the data set grows, we expect that our detection capabilities will continue to improve. In turn, we expect our customers to benefit from these improvements through regular software updates under our subscription business model. In a world where data is an increasingly decisive competitive advantage, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our customers in ways that competitors may be unable to match.

•Differentiated and Proprietary Technology Platform
We have invested significant resources in developing proprietary and patented technologies across artificial intelligence software, cloud services, and advanced sensors to accelerate the widespread adoption of touchless security screening. These technologies serve as the foundation of our products.
Our key innovations include:
•Technology to process radio frequency (“RF”) electromagnetic data across multiple frequencies to detect size, composition, and shape of metal objects while in motion.
•Technology to classify and differentiate the electromagnetic signature of weapons from harmless items such as smartphones and keys.
•Technology to isolate relevant electromagnetic signals in the presence of external interference and noise generated by environmental factors such as structural metal, wind, and other factors.
•Technology to process hundreds of thousands of sensor data points for each individual passing through security screening system while walking at a normal pace.
•Technology to isolate a detected threat carried by an individual among an unstructured, overlapping flow of visitors walking through the system at a normal pace.
•Technology to isolate the spatial location of detected threats and correlate this spatial data with digital imagery to provide a clear visual indicator to help security guards quickly and intuitively resolve any system alarms.
•In addition to these core detection-related innovations, we have developed a purpose-built, proprietary housing for our advanced sensor arrays that features an attractive, welcoming, and customizable industrial design and supports a wide variety of indoor and outdoor configurations. We have also created cloud services to capture and present rich analytics and insights, support for remote system monitoring, remote system upgrades as new capabilities become available, and remote system diagnostics, and mobile application access. This technology platform is the basis of our future products and is critical to enhancing our existing offerings. Elements of these technologies and processes are protected by our know-how and by multiple patents or pending patent applications.
We have also designed our platform with application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that allow integration and interoperability with complementary third-party security solutions such as biometric authentication, video management software, threat intelligence, messaging, and mass-notification systems. For example, we have used our APIs to integrate Evolv Express alerts to the Motorola Solutions Avigilon Control Center platform as well as to deployed venue access control systems. Other specific integrations to date include the Milestone Video Management System and Titan HST Mass Notification System.
•High Screening Throughput
Our unique detection methodology results in fewer nuisance alarms and allows visitors to walk through in unstructured flows, without emptying their pockets and without surrendering their bags for manual inspection. The overall result is screening that is up to ten times faster than old screening processes. The result is a visitor experience that is more like walking through a shoplifting prevention system at a department store than an airport security checkpoint.
•Significant Cost Savings
Because our technology generates fewer nuisance alarms and scans visitors so quickly, far fewer security guards and equipment is required. The total scanning costs are up to 70% lower with our products, allowing venues to reduce overall operational costs and making security screening financially feasible at more venues and events.

Our engineering team is led by accomplished and visionary technologists and scientists who have many years of experience in relevant fields. Our commercialization efforts are managed by individuals with prior successes in building and scaling both direct and indirect, channel-driven sales organizations.
•Self-Reinforcing Adoption Cycle
We believe that as we acquire more customers and deploy more of our products, we gather more digital data that helps us improve the detection accuracy and performance of our systems and provide deeper analytic insights to our customers. As the accuracy and analytic insight of our systems increases, we believe more prospective customers will be attracted to our products and more engaged prospects will choose to purchase our products. We anticipate that this cycle will continue to operate in the future, creating ongoing competitive advantages for us and for our reseller partners.
Our Products
Since our founding in 2013, we have developed an extensive portfolio of proprietary technologies that form the foundation of our integrated security screening products, which are comprised of artificial intelligence software, cloud services, and advanced sensors.

This data allows us to generate analytics that appear in our Evolv Insights™ application. Evolv Insights™ provides self-serve access, insights regarding visitor flow and arrival curves, location specific performance, system detection performance and alarm statistics, and comparisons across multiple business dimensions. Using Evolv Insights, organizations use the powerful dashboards and metrics provided to inform their security decisions, operationalize the way their security and venue operations teams make staffing and traffic flow decisions to avoid overcrowding, rebalance security and operational resources, and improve the overall experience for their guests.
Licensing Model
We primarily sell our solutions under a subscription agreement that bundles our AI-software, cloud services, and advanced sensor equipment. We refer to this subscription as “security-as-a-service,” or “SaaS.” The SaaS agreement provides customers access to our solution for a defined time, usually with a multi-year term, annual pre-payment installments, and no right of cancellation. In some situations, we also sell our products under a purchase-subscription agreement by which the customer agrees to pay a one-time upfront fee for the equipment and a mandatory multi-year subscription term with a related fee for access to our software and cloud services. We also directly offer short term rental agreements for our solutions and allow certain reseller partners to offer rental terms to customers under certain conditions.
Our Customers
Our customers include many iconic venues across a wide variety of industries including education, healthcare, professional sports, notable performing arts and entertainment venues, major tourist destinations and cultural attractions, large industrial workplaces, and houses of worship.
The majority of our customer agreements include non-cancelable multi-year commitments. Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Research and Development
We believe that the touchless security screening market is poised for rapid technological advancements across software, cloud services, and sensors. We invest significant resources into ongoing research and development programs because we believe our ability to maintain and extend our market position depends, in part, on breakthrough technologies that offer a unique value proposition for our customers and differentiation versus our competitors. Our research and development team, which is responsible for both the development of new products and improvements to our existing product portfolio, consists of talented and dedicated engineers, technicians, scientists, and professionals with experience from a wide variety of the world’s leading physical security, cybersecurity, and software technology organizations. Our primary areas of focus in research and development include, but are not limited to:

Table of Contents

•New applications that digitally transform operations in and adjacent to the arrival experience at venues and facilities; and
•Integrations into venue security infrastructure and operating systems.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our security screening products through both our own direct sales force and through a global distribution network consisting of dozens of value-added resellers. Our resellers sell our products to our joint customers, for whom they also perform installation, systems integration, and local support and maintenance services, with backup services provided by our internal support teams. Many resellers offer third-party physical security products including cameras, access control systems, and video monitoring systems in their respective territories and regions, which provides an opportunity to cross-sell our touchless security screening products to a broad, existing customer base that has purchased these other products. To augment the reach of our distribution network, we also intend to grow our direct sales efforts focused primarily on serving major accounts and expanding our footprint.
Our marketing strategies are focused on supporting sales growth by (1) driving awareness; (2) developing comprehensive sales and marketing content, tools, and campaigns for each stage of the sales process; (3) scaling those campaigns via our global distribution network, and (4) building our sales pipeline. We drive awareness for the Company, our security screening products, and our customers’ successes through public relations and communications efforts that span mainstream, business, social media and trade press across the security sector generally and in key verticals such as education, healthcare, professional sports as well as tourist sites, performing arts and entertainment, theme parks, industrial workplaces, and municipal governments. Our internal marketing team develops content in multiple formats and delivery methods to facilitate marketing campaigns and sales enablement.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our physical products are manufactured via a third-party contract manufacturer, Columbia Tech, based in the United States with international quality certifications, such as ISO9001:2015. We design the products and processes and internally manufacture the initial engineering prototypes. Our internal manufacturing and supply chain teams work collaboratively with both our internal engineering department and Columbia Tech to scale up the prototypes for commercialization through a phase gate product launch process. There have been significant efforts made over the last several years with Columbia Tech to scale up our production. Columbia Tech also provides a variety of services including sourcing off-the-shelf components, manufacturing custom components/assemblies, final product assembly and integration, end of line testing and quality assurance per our specifications, material and finished goods inventory, and direct global shipping to our customers.
We initially manage the supply chain for key components and materials, and then, in some cases, set up supply agreements in conjunction with our contract manufacturer to enable stable supply and redundancy where applicable. Component purchasing is managed by our contract manufacturer’s sourcing team under a vendor list approved by us to leverage the buying power of their global scale. All of our products are built to our specification, work instructions and testing protocols. Inventory levels are managed with our manufacturing partners to ensure an adequate supply is on hand to meet business forecasts.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to drive innovation in the security screening market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and abroad, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and through non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. However, our contractual provisions may not always be effective at preventing unauthorized parties from obtaining our intellectual property and proprietary technology.
Unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills make an important contribution to our business, but we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives and maintain our competitive position. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property or that it will provide any competitive advantage.

Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated. Further, the laws of certain countries may not protect intellectual property or proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2022, we own or co-own seven issued United States patents, thirteen issued foreign patents and have fifteen pending or allowed patent applications. In addition, we have five registered United States trademarks, one pending United States trademark applications, twenty-eight registered foreign trademarks and seventeen pending foreign trademark applications. Our patents and patent applications are directed to, among other things, security screening, threat detection and discrimination, imaging systems and related technologies. In addition to patents owned or co-owned by us, we have in-licensed ninety-five patents, including but not limited to metamaterials, RF imaging, compressive sensing, and signal processing, for security related applications.
While most of the intellectual property we use is developed and owned by us, we also use a combination of proprietary, open-source and third-party licensed software in connection with our services. Although we believe these licenses are sufficient for the operation of our business, these licenses typically limit our use of the third parties’ intellectual property to specific uses and for specific time periods.
From time to time, we have faced, and we expect to face in the future, allegations by third parties, including our competitors, that we have infringed their trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights or challenging the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We are not presently a party to any such legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Our employees are critical to our success. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 225 people, of which 223 are full-time employees. We also engage numerous consultants and contractors to supplement our permanent workforce. A majority of our employees are engaged in research and development and selling functions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be in good standing. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.

We are subject to various laws, regulations, and permitting requirements of federal, state, and local authorities, related to health and safety, anti-corruption, and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations, and permitting requirements.
Table of Contents

Anti-Corruption Export and Trade Matters
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories, including Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, unless authorized by OFAC or otherwise exempt from the regulations. In recent years, the United States government has a renewed focus on export control matters. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.
See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors — Failure to comply with applicable anti-corruption legislation, export controls, economic sanctions, and other governmental laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal penalties and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” for additional information about the environmental, health and safety laws, and regulations that apply to our business.
