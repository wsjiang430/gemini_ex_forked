ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
We are the leading company focused specifically on the science, development, and commercialization of technologies for peripheral nerve regeneration and repair. We are passionate about providing the opportunity to restore nerve function and quality of life for patients with peripheral nerve injuries. We provide innovative, clinically proven, and economically effective repair solutions for surgeons and healthcare providers. Peripheral nerves provide the pathways for both motor and sensory signals throughout the body. Every day, people suffer traumatic injuries or undergo surgical procedures that impact the function of their peripheral nerves. Physical damage to a peripheral nerve or the inability to properly reconnect peripheral nerves can result in the loss of muscle or organ function, the loss of sensory feeling, or the initiation of pain.
Our platform for peripheral nerve repair features a comprehensive portfolio of products, including:
•Avance® Nerve Graft, a biologically active off-the-shelf processed human nerve allograft for bridging severed peripheral nerves without the comorbidities associated with a second surgical site; 
•Axoguard Nerve Connector®, a porcine (pig) submucosa extracellular matrix ("ECM") coaptation aid for tensionless repair of severed peripheral nerves; 
•Axoguard Nerve Protector®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce the nerve reconstruction while preventing soft tissue attachments; 
•Axoguard Nerve Cap®, a porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma;
•Axotouch® Two-Point Discriminator, used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin.
We suspended the market availability of Avive® Soft Tissue Membrane ("Avive") effective June 1, 2021 and we continue discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any known or reported safety or product performance issues or concerns with Avive. We seek to return Avive to the market, although we are unable to estimate the timeframe or provide any assurances that a return to the market will be achievable. 
Our portfolio of products is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Germany, United Kingdom ("UK"), Spain and several other European, Asian and Latin American countries.
Nerves can be damaged in several ways. When a nerve is cut due to a traumatic injury or inadvertently during a surgical procedure, functionality of the nerve may be compromised, causing the nerve to no longer carry the signals to and from the brain to the muscles and skin thereby reducing or eliminating functionality. The loss of function can impact a person’s ability to work and perform daily tasks, to properly be aware and respond to their environment (e.g., heat, cold or other dangers), and could negatively impact their ability to experience and enjoy life. 
Nerve damage or transection of the type described above generally requires a surgical repair. Traditionally, the standard has been to either suture the nerve ends together directly without tension or to bridge the gap between the nerve ends with a less important nerve surgically removed from elsewhere in the patient’s own body, referred to as nerve autograft. More recently, synthetic or collagen conduits have been used for the repair of short gaps. Nerves that are not repaired or heal abnormally may result in a permanent loss of function and/or sensation. Additionally, abnormal healing can form a neuroma that may send altered signals to the brain resulting in the sensation of pain. This abnormal section of the nerve can, under certain circumstances, be surgically removed and the nerve managed by capping, burying or repairing the nerve.
In addition, compression on a nerve, blunt force trauma or other physical irritations to a nerve can cause nerve damage that may alter the signal conduction of the nerve, result in pain, and may, in some instances, require surgical intervention to address the resulting nerve compression. Finally, when a patient undergoes a mastectomy due to breast cancer or prophylactically due to a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, the nerves are cut to allow the removal of the breast tissue. This can result in a loss of sensation, the potential risk of a symptomatic neuroma, and could negatively impact the patient’s quality of life. When a patient chooses a breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, sensation and quality of life can, in certain cases, be returned through surgical nerve repair.
To improve the options available for the surgical repair and regeneration of peripheral nerves, we have developed and licensed regenerative medicine technologies. Our innovative approach to regenerative medicine has resulted in first-in-class products that we believe are redefining the peripheral nerve repair market. Our products are used by surgeons during surgical

interventions to repair a wide variety of physical nerve damage or transection throughout the body, which can range from a simple laceration of a finger to a complex brachial plexus injury (an injury to the network of nerves that control the movement and sensation of the shoulder, arm, and hand) as well as nerve injuries caused by dental, orthopedic, and other surgical procedures. 
Peripheral Nerve Regeneration Market Overview
Peripheral nerve injury (“PNI”) through damage or transection is a major source of physical disability impairing the ability to move muscles or to feel normal sensations. Patients suffer traumatic bodily injuries every day that may result in damage or transection to peripheral nerves severe enough to require surgical treatment. We break our total addressable market into four categories: (1) trauma ("Trauma"), (2) oral maxillofacial (“OMF”), (3) breast reconstruction neurotization ("Breast") and (4) Upper Extremity Compression (together, the "Total Addressable Market").
We estimate that U.S. PNI has a potential Total Addressable Market for our current product portfolio of $2.7 billion. Estimating the Total Addressable Market for nerve repair is challenging as there is not a simple data source for the incidence of peripheral nerve issues. This is further complicated by the fact that nerves can be injured through a variety of traumatic and surgical injuries and can impact a patient from head to toe. In addition, we believe nerves are often one of many structures injured in a trauma (i.e., amputation) or in surgery and the incidence of these nerve injuries are often not coded or tracked. Quantifying the procedures involving nerve repair may also be challenging. While selected trauma and surgical procedures are dedicated to the repair of nerves, most of the incidence of nerve repair is a step in a larger trauma or surgical procedure. Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") codes exist for surgeons to code for nerve repair; however, we believe the data substantially underestimates the total number of nerves repaired. Physicians are encouraged to document all steps of procedures, but open trauma often involves many surgical steps, and CPT codes may be inclusive of each other or may not be documented or reported in billing records. As a result, we believe CPT coding underrepresents the total number of nerve repairs performed in trauma. Because we believe CPT claims are not fully representative of the true volumes of nerve repair surgery, we follow an “empirical” methodology to estimate the Total Addressable Market – using published clinical literature and procedure databases to make what we believe are the most objective assumptions.
Trauma
The Trauma portion of the Total Addressable Market encompasses traumatic PNI throughout the body, with approximately 95% of injuries affecting upper and lower extremity nerves. We estimate that the Trauma portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $1.9 billion based upon epidemiological studies regarding the general number of trauma patients, clinical literature review reporting PNI incidence, and physician interviews. We have estimated the portion of these nerve repair procedures due to trauma that would require Gap Repair, Primary Repair and/or Nerve Protection and applied, as we believed was appropriate in each procedure segment, the number of units and average sales price of Avance Nerve Graft and the average market price for nerve connectors, and nerve protectors to determine the probable Total Addressable Market.
OMF
We estimate that the OMF portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $300 million annually, based upon research indicating that approximately 56,000 PNI occur in the U.S. each year related to third molar surgeries, anesthetic injections, dental implants, orthognathic surgery, and mandibular resection procedures. We have applied the average sales price of the Avance Nerve Graft, Axoguard Nerve Connector, and Axoguard Nerve Protector that address such PNI to derive the OMF portion of the estimated Total Addressable Market.
Breast
We estimate that the Breast portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $250 million. Currently, when a patient undergoes autologous breast reconstruction after a mastectomy, the patient receives the shape of a natural breast, but often times experiences little to no return of sensory feeling. In certain cases, sensation can be returned to the breast area with the use of our products through an innovative surgical technique called Resensation®. We believe that the ideal breast reconstruction should restore breast size, shape, symmetry, and softness, as well as sensation, without the potential risks and comorbidity associated with autograft. We believe the Resensation technique incorporates a patient's desire for the opportunity to return sensation to their breasts with a reproducible and efficient surgical approach for reconstructive plastic surgeons.

Upper Extremity Compression
PNI caused by recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome constitutes the "Upper Extremity Compression" portion of the Total Addressable Market. We estimate that the Upper Extremity Compression portion of the Total Addressable Market is approximately $270 million, or 130,000 procedures. We estimate there are approximately 488,000 primary carpal tunnel and 95,000 primary cubital tunnel relief surgeries performed annually in the U.S. We estimate that approximately 97,500 carpal tunnel revision surgeries and 32,400 total cubital tunnel procedures are addressable each year in the U.S. to mitigate the recurrence of symptoms. These revision and primary surgeries are required due to compression of the peripheral nerve associated with soft tissue attachments from the surrounding tissue or tissue infiltration entrapping the nerve. To prevent additional recurrences, surgeons will opt for a Nerve Protection which includes a product such as the Axoguard Nerve Protector. To derive the carpal and cubital tunnel revision portion of the Total Addressable Market, we multiplied the average market sales price of Axoguard Nerve Protectors by the number of estimated procedures. 
Although distribution and sales of products in the Trauma, OMF, Breast and Upper Extremity Compression portions of the Total Addressable Market constitute our primary revenue sources today, market expansion opportunities in lower extremity surgery, head and neck surgery, urology and the surgical treatment of pain could offer us expanded revenue opportunities. We have begun an expansion into the surgical treatment of pain with an initial focus in the treatment of neuroma in our existing call points. The size of the pain market opportunity is challenging to identify as the cause of the chronic pain is often not diagnosed and there has not historically been a surgical treatment to resolve the cause of the pain. We believe the market opportunity is sufficient to apply selected resources to the opportunity and there is a significant patient and societal need to reduce the use of pharmacologic solutions, including opioids. 
Our Product Portfolio
Avance Nerve Graft
Avance Nerve Graft is a biologically active nerve implant with more than ten years of comprehensive clinical evidence and more than 75,000 implants since launch. Avance Nerve Graft is processed nerve allograft (human) intended for surgical repair of peripheral nerve discontinuities to support regeneration across the defect. It is intended to act as a structural bridge in order to guide and support axonal regeneration across a peripheral nerve gap caused by traumatic injury or surgical intervention. Avance Nerve Graft is decellularized and sterile processed human peripheral nerve tissue. We developed Avance Nerve Graft by following the guiding principle that the human body created the optimal peripheral nerve structure. We, through our licensing efforts and research, developed the Avance MethodTM, a proprietary method for processing recovered human peripheral nerve tissue in a manner that preserves the essential structure of the ECM while cleansing away cellular and noncellular debris. Avance Nerve Graft provides the natural peripheral nerve structure of a nerve, including the native laminin to guide the regenerating nerve fibers. The nerve ECM is additionally processed to remove a natural inhibitor to regeneration called chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan.
We believe that Avance Nerve Graft is the first off-the-shelf human nerve allograft for bridging nerve transections. Avance Nerve Graft is comprised of bundles of small diameter endoneurial tubes that are held together by an outer sheath called the epineurium. Avance Nerve Graft has been processed to remove cellular and noncellular factors such as cells, fat, blood, and axonal debris, while preserving the three-dimensional laminin lined tubular bioscaffold (i.e., microarchitecture), epineurium and microvasculature of the peripheral nerve. After processing, Avance Nerve Graft is flexible and pliable, and its epineurium can be sutured in place allowing for tension-free approximation of the proximal and distal peripheral nerve stumps. During the healing process, the body revascularizes and gradually remodels the graft into the patient’s own tissue while allowing the processed peripheral nerve allograft to physically support axonal regeneration across the peripheral nerve transection. Avance Nerve Graft does not require immunosuppression for use.
With lengths up to 70 mm and diameters up to 5 mm, Avance Nerve Graft allows surgeons to choose and trim the implant to the correct length for repairing the relevant peripheral nerve gap, as well as to match the diameter to the proximal and distal end of the severed peripheral nerve. Avance Nerve Graft is stored frozen and utilizes packaging that maintains the graft in a sterile condition. The packaging is typical for medical products so the surgical staff is familiar with opening the package for transfer of Avance Nerve Graft into the sterile surgical field. Such packaging also provides protection during shipment and storage and a reservoir for the addition of sterile fluid to aid in thawing the product. Avance Nerve Graft thaws in less than 10 minutes, and once thawed, it is ready for implantation.

Axoguard Nerve Connector
Axoguard Nerve Connector is a coaptation aid used to align and connect severed peripheral nerve ends in a tensionless repair. The product is in a tubular shape with an open lumen on each end where the severed peripheral nerve ends are placed. It is typically used when the gap between the peripheral nerve ends is 5mm or less in length. Axoguard Nerve Connector is made from a processed porcine ECM that allows the body’s natural healing process to repair the peripheral nerve while its tube shape isolates and protects the transected nerves during the healing process. During healing, the patient’s own cells incorporate into the ECM product to remodel and form a tissue similar to the outermost layer of the peripheral nerve (nerve epineurium). Axoguard Nerve Connector is provided sterile, for single use only, and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon’s needs.
Axoguard Nerve Connector can be used:
•As an alternative to direct suture repair;
•As a peripheral nerve coaptation; Connector-Assisted Repair®;
•To aid coaptation in direct repair, grafting, or cable grafting repairs; and
•To reinforce the coaptation site.
Axoguard Nerve Connector has the following advantages:
•Processed intact porcine ECM with an open, porous structure that allows for cell infiltration and remodeling;
•Designed as a coaptation aid for tensionless repair of transected or severed peripheral nerves;
•Alleviates tension at the repair site;
•Remodels into the patient’s own tissue;
•Reduces the number of required sutures (versus direct repair with suture);
•Allows surgeon to move sutures away from the repair site which may minimize inflammation and aid nerve regeneration;
•Reduces potential for fascicular mismatch;
•Allows visualization of underlying peripheral nerve ends;
•Available in seven different diameters and two different lengths to address a variety of nerve repair situations;
•Strong and flexible, easy to suture; and
•Stored at room temperature with a minimum of 18-month shelf life.
Axoguard Nerve Protector
Axoguard Nerve Protector is a product used to protect and wrap damaged peripheral nerves and reinforce reconstructed nerve gaps while preventing soft tissue attachments. It is designed to protect and isolate the peripheral nerve during the healing process after surgery by creating a barrier between the nerve tissue and the surrounding tissue bed. The product is delivered in a slit tube format allowing it to be wrapped around peripheral nerve structures. Axoguard Nerve Protector is made from a processed porcine ECM. During healing, the ECM remodels allowing the protector to separate the peripheral nerve from the surrounding tissue. Axoguard Nerve Protector competes against off-the-shelf biomaterials such as reconstituted bovine collagen as well as the use of the patient’s own tissue such as vein and hypothenar fat pad wrapping. Axoguard Nerve Protector is provided sterile, for single use only, and in a variety of sizes to meet the surgeon’s needs.
Table of Content

Axoguard Nerve Protector can be used to:
•Separate and protect the nerve from the surrounding tissue during the healing process;
•Minimize risk of soft tissue attachments and entrapment in compressed peripheral nerves;

Axoguard Nerve Cap
Axoguard Nerve Cap is a proprietary porcine submucosa ECM product used to protect a peripheral nerve end and separate the nerve from the surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma.
Nerves are often cut in a variety of surgeries and a nerve that is cut and not reconstructed may form an entangled mass of disorganized nerve and fibrous tissue that could cause debilitating pain called a symptomatic neuroma. Neuromas are a potential cause of pain for those patients who complain of chronic post-surgical pain, including in amputees, which may lead to an inability to use their prosthesis. Despite more than 30 different treatment methods, it is our belief that neuromas continue to be an unresolved problem in microsurgery. We believe the Axoguard Nerve Cap can address these painful neuroma and address nerve pain without the complications of traditional methods, including pharmacotherapy and chemical injections, among others. Axoguard Nerve Cap can be used to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma formation.
Axoguard Nerve Cap has the following advantages:
•Separates the nerve end from surrounding tissue, neurotrophic factors and mechanical stimulation;
•Reduces painful neuroma formation;
•Allows for anchoring of a nerve end or stump to nearby tissue structure;
•Material gradually remodels into the patient’s own tissue to protect the nerve end; and
•Semi-translucence allows for visualization of nerve ends or stumps and easy visualization for suture placement.
Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator tool can be used to measure the innervation density of any surface area of the skin. The discs are useful for determining sensation after damage to a peripheral nerve, following the progression of a repaired peripheral nerve, and during the evaluation of a person with possible peripheral nerve damage, such as compression. The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator is a Class I 510(k) exempt medical device.
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator tool is a set of two aluminum discs each containing a series of prongs spaced between two to 15 millimeters apart. Additionally, 20 and 25 millimeter spacing is provided. A circular depression on either side of the disc allows ease of rotation. The discs can be rotated between a single prong for testing one-point and any of the other spaced prongs for testing two-point intervals.

•Clear numbering allows users to interpret results; and
•Reusable carry case protects discs.
Avive Soft Tissue Membrane
We suspended the market availability of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane ("Avive") effective June 1, 2021, and we continue discussions with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any known or reported safety or product performance issues or concerns with Avive. We seek to return Avive to the market, although we are unable to estimate the timeframe or provide any assurances that a return to the market will be achievable. 
Acroval Neurosensory and Motor Testing System
 Effective November 2019, we discontinued all sales of the Acroval Neurosensory and Motor Testing System. We continue to provide service and support for the existing systems in the marketplace. 
Tissue Recovery and Processing 
Avance Nerve Graft Processing Overview
We developed the Avance Method, an advanced and proprietary technique to process Avance Nerve Graft from donated human peripheral nerve tissue. The Avance Method requires special training over several months for each manufacturing associate who processes Avance Nerve Grafts. The processing and manufacturing system for Avance Nerve Graft has required significant capital investment, and we seek to continually improve our manufacturing and quality assurance processes and systems. Our Avance Method is depicted as follows:
Tissue Processing
Our Avance Method consists of several steps, including peripheral nerve tissue recovery/acquisition and testing, donor medical review and release, processing, packaging, and sterilization to meet or exceed all applicable FDA, state, and international regulations and American Association of Tissue Banks (“AATB”) standards. We have a number of contracts with 
Table of Content

recovery and acquisition agencies to supply peripheral nerve tissue and umbilical cord and believe these contracts, and the ability to enter into additional contracts, will provide us with the tissues we require for our Avance implants. As an FDA registered tissue establishment, we utilize both our own personnel and a variety of subcontractors for recovery/acquisition, storage, testing, processing and sterilization of the donated peripheral nerve and umbilical cord tissue. Additionally, we along with our subcontractors have contracted with independent Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP") and Good Laboratory Practice ("GLP") compliant laboratories to perform testing for product release. The safety of Avance Nerve Graft is supported by donor screening, process validation, process controls, and validated terminal sterilization methods. The Axogen Quality System has built in redundancies that are meant to control the release of each product for implantation only after such product meets our quality control and product requirements.
Tissue Recovery and Processing Facility
We partner with other FDA registered tissue establishments and AATB accredited recovery agencies or recovery agencies in compliance with FDA, state and international regulations and AATB standards for human tissue recovery. After consent for donation is obtained, donations are screened and tested in detail for safety in compliance with FDA, state and international regulations and AATB standards on communicable disease transmission. We process and package Avance Nerve Graft using our employees and equipment pursuant to a License and Services Agreement, as amended (the “CTS Agreement”) with Community Blood Center (doing business as Community Tissue Services) (“CTS”), in Dayton, Ohio. CTS is an FDA registered tissue establishment and an AATB accredited organization. 
The current CTS Agreement, which was amended in August 2022, terminates December 31, 2023, subject to earlier termination by either party at any time for cause (subject to the non-terminating party’s right to cure, in certain circumstances), or without cause upon 6 months prior notice. Under the CTS Agreement, we pay CTS a facility fee for clean room/manufacturing, storage, and office space. CTS also provides services in support of our manufacturing such as routine sterilization of daily supplies, providing disposable supplies and microbial services, and office support. The service fee is based on a per donor batch rate. The CTS facility provides a cost effective, quality controlled and licensed facility. Our processing methods and process controls have been developed and validated to ensure product uniformity and quality. Pursuant to the CTS Agreement, we pay license fees on a monthly basis to CTS. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Service Agreements."
We are renovating a property located near the CTS facility, the Axogen Processing Center facility (the "APC Facility") comprised of a 107,000 square foot building on approximately 8.6 acres of land. It is expected that renovation and validation will be completed before the termination date of the CTS Agreement to provide a new processing facility that can be included in our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for Avance Nerve Graft and we expect to transfer processing of Avance Nerve Grafts to the APC Facility in mid-2023. The capacity of the property once operational, along with the ability for expansion, is expected to provide processing capabilities that will meet our intended sales growth. We have obtained certain economic development grants from state and local authorities totaling $2,685 including $1,250 of cash grants to offset costs to acquire and develop the APC Facility. The economic development grants are subject to certain job creation milestones by 2023 and related contingencies. We have received approximately $1,188 from these grants through December 31, 2022. These grants have claw back clauses if we do not meet these job creation milestones by 2023, we have sent requests to the grant authorities for extensions of the job creation milestones; however, we have not yet received a decision from the grant authorities regarding whether extensions will be granted. See "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies - Service Agreements."
Tissue Packaging
After processing, the packaging operation is performed in a controlled environment at the CTS facility. Each Avance Nerve Graft is visually inspected and organized by size into finished product codes. The tissue implant is then packaged in primary packaging. The outer pouch acts as the primary sterility and moisture barrier.
Tissue Sterilization and Labeling
After being processed and packaged, Avance Nerve Graft is then terminally sterilized and shipped to our Burleson, Texas distribution facility (the “Distribution Facility”). There the products receive their final labels and are released following a final stringent technical and quality review. Orders for Avance Nerve Graft and are placed with our customer care team and the products are packaged and shipped from the Distribution Facility.

Tissue Product Release
We have established quality procedures for review of tissue recovery, relevant donor medical record review and release to processing that meet or exceed FDA requirements as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations ("CFR") 21 CFR Part 1271, state regulations, international regulations and AATB standards. The Axogen Quality System meets the requirements set forth under 21 CFR Part 1271 for Human Cells, Tissues and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, including Good Tissue Practices (“GTP”) and is compliant with the 21 CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulations (“QSR”). Furthermore, we utilize validated processes for the handling of raw material components, environmental control, processing, packaging, and terminal sterilization. In addition to ongoing monitoring activities for product conformity to specifications and sterility, shipping methods have been validated in accordance with applicable industry standards.
Manufacturing of Our Medical Device Classified Products 
Manufacturing for the Axoguard Product Line
The Axoguard product line is manufactured by Cook Biotech Incorporated, in West Lafayette, Indiana (“Cook Biotech”), which was established in 1995 to develop and manufacture implants utilizing porcine ECM. We decided to expand our portfolio of products and felt that the unique ECM material offered by Cook Biotech provided the combination of properties needed in nerve reconstruction. Cook Biotech’s ECM material is pliable, capable of being sutured, translucent and allows the patient’s own cells to incorporate into the ECM to remodel and form a tissue similar to the nerve’s epineurium. Cook Biotech has its own source of the raw material for the ECM material and manufactures Axoguard products from such sources.
Axoguard Nerve Connector and Nerve Protector
In August 2008, we entered into an agreement with Cook Biotech, amended in February 2012 and February 26, 2018 (the “Distribution Agreement”), to distribute its ECM technology in the form of the Surgisis® Nerve Cuff, the form of a nerve wrap or patch, or any other mutually agreed to configuration. The Surgisis products were rebranded under our Axoguard name and consist of the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector. Our distribution rights are worldwide in the field of the peripheral and central nervous system but excluding use of the products in the oral cavity for endodontic and periodontal applications and OMF surgery solely as they relate to dental, soft or hard tissue repair, or reconstruction. We believe the exclusion does not limit our identified OMF market, but expansion into certain additional OMF market areas could be limited to our other products not subject to the Distribution Agreement.
Axoguard Nerve Cap
We developed, patented, and obtained FDA regulatory clearance for the Axoguard Nerve Cap August 8, 2017. This device is made with Cook Biotech’s ECM material. Pursuant to the Nerve End Cap Supply Agreement dated June 27, 2017 (the “Supply Agreement”), as amended on April 6, 2020 (the "Amended Supply Agreement"), Cook Biotech is the exclusive contract manufacturer of the Axoguard Nerve Cap and both parties have provided the other party the necessary licenses to their technologies for operation of the Amended Supply Agreement. Consistent with Axoguard connectors and Axoguard Protectors, we are able to sell the Axoguard Nerve Cap worldwide in the field of the peripheral and central nervous system, but subject to the same exclusions as Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector.
The Distribution Agreement terminates on June 30, 2027. Although the agreement requires certain minimum purchases, through mutual agreement, the parties have not established such minimums and to date have not enforced such provision. The Distribution Agreement also establishes a formula for the transfer cost of the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector. The Amended Supply Agreement has a term through August 27, 2027. 
Manufacturing for the Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator
The Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator was contract manufactured by Viron Technologies, doing business as Cybernetics Research Laboratories (“CRL”), in Tucson, Arizona. CRL supplied the Axotouch unpackaged, and they are packaged at our distribution facility in Burleson, Texas. We believe we have enough inventory on hand to support sales through 2024.
Sales and Marketing
Overview
We are focused on developing the peripheral nerve repair and regeneration market, committed to improving awareness of new surgical peripheral nerve repair options and is building additional scientific and clinical data to assist surgeons and patients in making informed choices with respect to the repair of peripheral nerve injuries. We believe that there is an opportunity to 
Table of Content

improve current approaches to peripheral nerve repair and that our approach will solidify our position as a leader in the field of peripheral nerve repair products. The following provides the key elements of our sales and marketing strategy.
Increase Awareness of Our Products
Prior to the introduction of our portfolio of peripheral nerve repair products, surgeons had a limited number of options available to surgically repair damaged or transected peripheral nerves. We entered the market to improve the standard of care for nerve injury patients. We intend to increase market penetration and share by increasing awareness of the impact of nerve damage on quality of life and improving the adoption of nerve repair techniques and our products through the continued use of educational conferences and presentations, surgical resident and fellow training, scientific publications, digital communication, and a knowledgeable and professional sales team. We work to increase the use of our products within active accounts as well as expand the overall customer base by adding new active accounts. We define an active account as an account that has typically gone through the committee approval process, has at least one surgeon who has converted a portion of his or her treatment algorithms for peripheral nerve repair to our portfolio and have ordered our products at least six times in the last 12 months. As our business continues to grow, we have transitioned to reporting a new account metric that we believe demonstrates the strength of adoption and potential revenue growth in accounts that have developed a more consistent use of our products in their nerve repair algorithm. We refer to these as core accounts which are defined as accounts that have purchased at least $100,000 in the past 12 months. We are focused on plastic reconstructive surgeons and orthopedic and plastic hand surgeons who perform surgeries on patients suffering traumatic nerve damage or transection, on oral and maxillofacial surgeons who repair damaged oral nerves, and on plastic reconstructive surgeons who perform breast neurotization.
Expand Clinical and Scientific Data Regarding the Performance of Our Products
Generating clinical data is an important component of our marketing strategy. As of December 31, 2022, there have been over two hundred peer reviewed clinical publications related to our products. Certain of these publications contain data on multiple products. We will continue to accept subjects, for which there are more than 2,700 Avance nerve repairs enrolled to date, in our RANGER® clinical study (defined below in “Government Regulations”), a utilization registry of Avance Nerve Graft. An additional arm of the RANGER study has been initiated, tracking neurotization outcomes in breast reconstruction (Sensation-NOW®). Eleven of the above-mentioned publications and more than 70 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the registry. Rethink Pain™, a multicenter observational registry in the area of nerve pain and the surgical treatment of pain, has been initiated and enrollment is underway. A number of additional investigator-initiated case reports, studies, and publications have been completed, including breast neurotization, mandible reconstruction, compressive neuropathies, and the surgical treatment of pain. Case series in brachial plexus, neurotization of breast reconstruction, compression injuries and the surgical treatment of pain are also being developed. We also support outside research and will continue to work with investigators on grants with a translational focus.
RECON, a phase 3 pivotal, multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative study of hollow tube conduits and Avance Nerve Graft to support the transition of Avance to a biological product has completed enrollment, follow-up, and analysis. See “Government Regulations – Clinical Trials.” The pilot phase of REPOSE, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, and subject blinded study of Axoguard Nerve Cap as compared to neurectomy alone for the treatment of symptomatic neuroma, has published and the comparative phase has completed enrollment and is currently in follow-up. Enrollment is underway in REPOSE XL, a study titled, Tolerability and Feasibility Pilot Clinical Study of a Large-Diameter Nerve Cap for Protecting and Preserving Terminated Nerve Ends. ASSIST, a registry study of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane in acute trauma completed follow-up of all enrolled subjects in December 2020. Sensation-NOW (defined below in "Axogen Clinical Trials"), a RANGER (defined below in "Government Regulations") study arm for breast neurotization continues to enroll, as does the additional expansion arm Matched Autograft and Tube Conduit Case Control Cohort Arm of RANGER ("MATCHSM"), a contemporary cohort control which provides reference controls for nerve autograft and manufactured conduits from participating clinical study centers.
Commitment to the Education of Best Practices in Peripheral Nerve Repair
We have established educational conferences and presentations and surgical resident and fellow training that we believe have positioned us as a leader in providing peripheral nerve repair best practices. In 2022, we trained more than three-quarters of hand and microsurgery surgeon fellows in the U.S. through such courses and training.] We have historically provided education on peripheral nerve repair through in-person national programs, including its “Advances and Best Practices in Nerve Repair” as well as local and regional educational events. In 2022, we utilized virtual education events and in-person educational events. In 2023, we expect to again offer multiple educational programs including virtual and in-person surgeon education programs. Our education efforts also continue to include online tools and discussion forums such as Nerve Matters, an online community of peripheral nerve surgeons where the surgeons can ask questions, present cases, and share findings in the area of peripheral nerve repair.

Focused on developing deeper penetration with our existing accounts through development of long-term users of our algorithm in our largest market opportunity of extremity trauma
We provide full sales and distribution services. As of December 31, 2022, we had 115 direct sales professionals in the U.S. Our direct sales force continues to be supplemented by independent sales agencies that represent approximately 10% of our total revenue.We believe that near-term growth can be supported first through expanded productivity of our existing sales force as they go deeper with existing accounts and then by adding additional surgeons and accounts. We expect the number of direct sales professionals to increase over time. Additionally, we have successfully utilized a hybrid commercial approach that includes the use of independent agencies in more remote geographies to provide appropriate local support for surgeons, without the travel time required of a direct sales representative. 
Our products are available and sold in 17 countries outside the U.S. through a number of independent in-country distributors. We provide support and resources for independent agencies and distributors both within and outside the U.S, including two contractors in Germany. We provide our products to hospitals, surgery centers and military hospitals, calling on surgeons, including plastic reconstructive surgeons, orthopedic and plastic hand surgeons, and certain oral and maxillofacial surgeons to review the benefits of our products. While surgeons make the decision to implant our products in appropriate patients, hospitals make the decision to purchase the products from us. In today’s budget constrained environment, hospital committees review new technologies for cost effectiveness as well as quality. We believe that we have been successful in meeting the needs of these hospital committees by demonstrating the cost/benefit of our products and providing a fair value to the hospital. 
Expand the Product Pipeline and Applications in Peripheral Nerve Repair
We have developed and continue to develop new and next generation products to support surgeons in their needs for repairing damaged or transected peripheral nerves. We believe additional opportunities exist to develop or acquire complementary products in peripheral nerve repair. In addition, there are opportunities to expand the existing portfolio of products in new applications of peripheral nerve repair in applications such as lower extremity surgery, head and neck surgery, urology, and the surgical treatment of pain.
Avance Nerve Graft Performance
We have worked with leading institutions, researchers, and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. We believe our RANGER study (defined below in “Government Regulations”) is the largest multi-center clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. We have completed the RECON study (defined below in "Axogen Clinical Trials"). This study is a phase 3 trial to support our BLA for the Avance Nerve Graft. See “Government Regulations - Clinical Trials - Axogen Clinical Trials.” 
International Opportunity for Revenue 
We currently focus primarily on the U.S. market, with additional foreign distribution and sales in Canada, Germany, UK, Spain, and several other European, Asian and Latin American countries. The need for the surgical repair of damaged or transected nerves is a global opportunity. Through our revenue outside the U.S., we have demonstrated the capability to take our current peripheral nerve repair surgical portfolio into new geographical markets. We currently have European Union (“E.U.”)-wide registration only for Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector as approval/registration for Avance Nerve Graft as human tissue is required in each individual country. Avance Nerve Graft has been granted marketing authorization in Germany and direct commercial operations began in 2022. Currently, Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator and Axoguard Nerve Cap are available only in the U.S. Introduction of our products into foreign markets is subject to meeting the appropriate regulatory standards of particular countries and any appropriate E.U.-wide regulation or directive. In addition to regulatory approval, reimbursement approval is necessary to achieve material product adoption in most countries. Avance Nerve graft has achieved NICE approval in the UK for digital nerve repair and reimbursement approval in South Korea for repairs up to 50mm in length for sensory nerves when an autograft is not possible. To date, revenue from international distribution and sales have not been material, there are no material risks associated with foreign operations, and we do not have dependencies as to international revenue. See " Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our operations must comply with FDA and other governmental requirements."

Research and Development
We believe that we provide the most extensive product portfolio for peripheral nerve injuries available. Our current development focus is to expand clinical data in peripheral nerve repair surgical applications, to develop product line extensions of the Avance and Axoguard products and new technologies/products for peripheral nerve repair. 
We work with academic institutions in the expansion of treatments for peripheral nerve and are involved in a number of grants from government agencies related to nerve repair or use of our products and/or technologies. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we spent approximately $24.2 million on total research and development expenses for product and clinical development, including expenses related to the transition of Avance Nerve Graft to a biological product.
Competition
The medical device and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. As such, we cannot predict what products may be offered in the future that may compete with our products. In the peripheral nerve repair market, we compete primarily against all transected and non-transected peripheral nerve repair approaches, including direct suture repair, autograft, and hollow-tube nerve conduits and materials used to wrap and protect damaged peripheral nerve tissue. 
Because the requirements of the biomaterials used in peripheral nerve repair can vary based on the severity and location of the damaged nerve, the size and function of the nerve, surgical technique, and patient preference, our peripheral nerve repair products compete against both autograft materials (nerve in the case of a bridging repair and vein or fat in the case of a nerve protection repair), and a limited number of off-the-shelf alternatives for repairing and protecting. Competitive aspects of our products focus on their overall value proposition and suitability for specific applications and can include composition and structure of the material, ease of use, clinical evidence, handling, and price. Our major competitors for off-the-shelf repair options in hollow-tube conduits and bio-absorbable wraps are Integra LifeSciences Holding Corporation, Baxter International, Inc., and Stryker Corporation.
We believe any current or future competitors face the following important barriers to market entry as it relates to its peripheral nerve repair products. Our intellectual property (“IP”), and that of our partners, including patents, patents-pending, trade secrets, and know how, is believed to be an important barrier for our Avance Nerve Graft and Axoguard products. We have developed knowledge and experience in understanding and meeting FDA regulatory requirements for Avance Nerve Graft, including having made a substantial investment in conducting the pre-clinical and clinical testing necessary to support a submission for an FDA BLA. Additionally, we believe our ability to offer a portfolio of products focused on peripheral nerve repair and the breadth of clinical data associated with the products provides a unique competitive position versus other entities that do not have this breadth of product offering. However, due to our limited resources, our smaller size, and our relatively early stage, we believe we may face competitive challenges from larger entities and market factors that could negatively impact our growth, including competitors’ introduction of new products and competitors’ bundling of products to achieve pricing benefits.(See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Technological change and competition for newly developed products could reduce demand for our products”; “Risk Factors –– Our operating results could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage and sustain our future growth or scale our operations”).
Intellectual Property
Overview
We protect our IP through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights. In addition, we safeguard our trade secrets and other confidential know-how, and carefully protects these and other IP rights when engaging with third parties. For example, we require vendors, contract organizations, consultants, advisors, and employees to execute confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and to appropriately protect any information disclosed to them by us so as to preserve confidential and/or trade secret status. We also require consultants, advisors, and employees to assign their rights to any IP arising out of their relationship with us to us.
License Agreements
We have entered into license agreements with University of Florida Research Foundation (the “UFRF”) and the University of Texas at Austin (“UTA”). Under the terms of these license agreements, we hold exclusive worldwide licenses to underlying technologies used by us in our Avance Nerve Graft. The license agreements include both the right to issued patents and patents pending in the U.S. and international markets. The effective term of the license agreements extends through the term of the related patents. Currently, we pay royalties to UFRF and UTA specific to the licensed technologies related to Avance Nerve Graft.
Table of Content

Patents
As of the date of this Form 10-K, we own or are the exclusive licensee of about thirty issued U.S. patents, more than thirty-five pending U.S. patent applications (including those for which we have received a notice of allowance) and more than one hundred and forty international patents and patent applications with regard to our peripheral nerve products and other related technologies. 
With respect to our Avance Nerve Graft, we have patent protection in the U.S. through at least December 2023. [In addition, per Section 351(k)(7) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, we believe we will have a period of 12 years total exclusivity in the U.S. for reference product,-meaning protection from biosimilars. Pursuant to the PHS Act, periods of reference product exclusivity begins on the date on which the reference product is first licensed (Section 351(i)(4)). In this context we anticipate Avance would be eligible to receive up to 12 years market exclusivity as the first product of its class to be licensed. Finally, we have Enforcement Discretion from the FDA regarding continued distribution under controls applicable to Human Cellular and Tissue-based Products (“HCT/Ps”) with an agreed transition plan to a BLA. We believe a competitive processed peripheral nerve allograft would need to successfully complete BLA Phase I, II and III clinical studies prior to clinical release, the completion of which we believe would take at least eight years.
Our policy is to seek patent protection for, or where strategically preferable, maintain as trade secret, the inventions that we consider important to our products and the development of our business. We have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection for select proprietary technologies and other inventions emanating from our research and development ("R&D"), including with respect to uses, methods, and compositions, in an effort to further fortify our IP stronghold in areas of importance to us and our growing product portfolio. In instances that patent protection is not possible, product value to our portfolio can still be derived.
Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Copyrights
We hold a significant portfolio of hundreds of registered and applied-for trademarks in the U.S. and worldwide. Protection of our trademarks allows us to prevent competitors from, for example, using the same or a confusingly similar company name, or the same or confusingly similar product names within identified classes of goods that could otherwise wrongfully allow such competitors to capitalize on our brand, reputation, and goodwill, and thereby improperly bolster their sales or reputations through, for example, consumer confusion, a false indication of our endorsement, or of a false indication of corporate or contractual relationship with us. We police and enforce our marks. 
We possess trade secrets and material know-how in the following general subject matters: nerve and tissue processing, nerve repair, product testing methods, and pre-clinical and clinical expertise. We have registered copyrights for training tools and artistic renderings. Additionally, we entered into the Distribution Agreement and Supply Agreement with Cook Biotech for the Axoguard products. Cook Biotech believes it has know-how and trade secrets with respect to its ECM technology that provides certain competitive obstacles that protect our IP.
Government Regulations
U.S. Government Regulation Overview
Our products are subject to regulation throughout their lifecycle by the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. In addition, our Avance Nerve Graft must comply with the standards of the tissue bank industry’s accrediting organization, the AATB.
We distribute Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products for Cook Biotech, and Cook Biotech is responsible for the regulatory compliance of these products. These Axoguard products are regulated as medical devices and subject to pre-market notification requirements under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), 21 CFR Part 820 (“Quality System Regulation”), and related laws and regulations. Cook Biotech has obtained a 510(k) pre-market clearance for Axoguard Nerve Connector from the FDA for the use of porcine small intestine submucosa for the repair of peripheral nerve transections where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. Cook Biotech has also obtained a 510(k) pre-market clearance for Axoguard Nerve Protector for the repair of peripheral nerve damage in which there is no gap or where a gap closure is achieved by flexion of the extremity. We sell the 510(k) cleared devices under the trade names Axoguard Nerve Protector and Axoguard Nerve Connector.
We also sell the Axoguard Nerve Cap product, which is classified by the FDA as a Class II device. The Axoguard Nerve Cap was cleared for market under 510(k) K163446. It is classified by FDA under 21 CFR 882.5275 (Nerve Cuff, product code: 
Table of Content

JXI). Cook Biotech is the contract manufacturer for our Axoguard Nerve Cap product and we are responsible for the regulatory compliance of this product.
We also distribute the Axotouch Two-Point Discriminator. This device is manufactured for us and distributed from the Burleson Facility. It is a Class I device (general controls) that is exempt from pre-market notification and the Quality System Regulation requirements except for the Recordkeeping and Complaint file requirements. It is classified by FDA under 21 CFR 882.1200 (Two-point discriminator, product code: GWI).
We are responsible for the regulatory compliance of Avive Soft Tissue Membrane, which we suspended the market availability of effective June 1, 2021. We continue discussions with the FDA to determine the appropriate regulatory classification and requirements for Avive. The suspension was not based on any known or reported safety or product performance concerns with Avive. 
FDA — General
FDA regulations govern nearly all the activities that we perform, or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses. The activities the FDA regulates include the following:
•Product design, development, and manufacture;
•Product safety, testing, labeling, and storage;
•Pre-clinical testing in animals and in the laboratory;
•Clinical investigations in humans;
•Pre-marketing clearance, approval, or licensing;
•Record-keeping and document-retention procedures;
•Advertising and promotion;
•The import and export of products;
•Product marketing, sales, and distribution;
•Post-marketing surveillance and medical device reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, communicable diseases, device malfunctions, or other adverse events; and
•Corrective actions, removals and recalls.
Failure to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicially imposed penalties or sanctions and/or prevent us from obtaining or maintaining required approvals, clearances, or licenses to manufacture and market our products. It could also subject us to enforcement actions or sanctions, such as agency refusal to approve pending applications, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution of products, injunctions, or civil monetary penalties or criminal prosecution.
FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements - Medical Devices
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the U.S. requires either a 510(k) pre-market notification submission or a Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) Application to the FDA, or other FDA regulatory authorization. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk, the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device and how much is known about the type of device. For devices first intended for marketing after May 28, 1976, pre-market review and clearance by the FDA for Class I and II medical devices is accomplished through the 510(k) pre-market notification procedure by finding a device substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or II device, unless the device is exempt. The majority of Class I medical devices are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices for which Class II controls are inadequate to assure safety or effectiveness, and novel devices, including devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. Class III devices generally require an approved PMA prior to marketing, unless classified into Class I or Class II through a De Novo request.
A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction, and the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for Drugs and Biologics
Federal law requires that a new drug be the subject of an approved marketing application and that a biological product be properly licensed before each is introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce. Because a sponsor often 
Table of Content

needs to ship an investigational drug or biological product to clinical investigators in many states, it must seek an exemption from that legal requirement. The IND is the means through which the sponsor obtains this exemption from the FDA. It is additionally the request from a clinical study sponsor to obtain authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug or biological product to humans. 
There are two IND categories: Commercial and Research (non-commercial). The IND application must contain information in three broad areas:
•Animal Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies - Preclinical data to permit an assessment as to whether the product is reasonably safe for initial testing in humans. Also included are any previous experience with the drug in humans (often foreign use).
•Manufacturing Information - Information pertaining to the composition, manufacturer, stability, and controls used for manufacturing the drug substance and the drug product. This information is assessed to ensure that the company can adequately produce and supply consistent batches of the drug.
•Clinical Protocols and Investigator Information - Detailed protocols for proposed clinical studies to assess whether the initial-phase trials will expose subjects to unnecessary risks. Also, information on the qualifications of clinical investigators--professionals (generally physicians) who oversee the administration of the experimental compound--to assess whether they are qualified to fulfill their clinical trial duties. Finally, commitments to obtain informed consent from the research subjects, to obtain review of the study by an institutional review board (IRB), and to adhere to the investigational new drug regulations.
Once the IND is submitted, the sponsor must wait 30 calendar days before initiating any clinical trials. During this time, the FDA has an opportunity to review the IND for safety to assure that research subjects will not be subjected to unreasonable risk. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials and or supporting pre-clinical data as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Therefore, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
The following regulations apply to the IND application process:
•21CFR Part 201    Drug Labeling
•21CFR Part 312    Investigational New Drug Application
•21CFR Part 314    IND and NDA Applications for FDA Approval to Market a New Drug (New Drug Approval)
•21CFR Part 316    Orphan Drugs
•21CFR Part 50    Protection of Human Subjects
•21CFR Part 54    Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators
•21CFR Part 56    Institutional Review Boards
•21CFR Part 58    Good Lab Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory [Animal] Studies
Biological Product License Application (BLA) Pathway
The Biologics License Application (BLA) is a request for permission to introduce, or deliver for introduction, a biological product into interstate commerce (21 CFR 601.2). Form 356h specifies the requirements for a BLA. Biological products require FDA approval of a BLA to be marketed. The application must demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of the product candidate based on results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. A BLA must also contain extensive Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC") and other manufacturing information, as well as Labeling information. The applicant must pass an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biological product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") requirements. Satisfaction of FDA approval requirements for biologics typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based on the type, complexity, and novelty of the product. We cannot be certain that any BLA approvals for our products will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
The steps for obtaining FDA approval of a BLA to market a biological product in the U.S. include:
•Completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies under the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations;
•Submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and which must include independent Institutional Review Board, ("IRB"), approval at each clinical site before the trials may be initiated;
•Performance of an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in accordance with Good Clinical Practices to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication;
Table of Content

•Submission to the FDA of a BLA, which contains detailed information about the CMC for the product, reports of the outcomes and full data sets from the clinical trials, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product;
•Satisfactory review of the contents of the BLA by the FDA, including the satisfactory resolution of any questions raised during the review;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations, to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity; and
•FDA approval of the BLA, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
Avance Nerve Graft Regulatory Classification and Regulatory Pathway
Avance Nerve Graft has been marketed domestically and internationally since 2007. In 2010, the FDA provided us with an enforcement discretion letter, regarding the marketing of Avance so long as we complied with certain terms that focused us on taking the necessary steps to support a BLA submission for the product. The FDA will end the period of enforcement discretion upon a final determination of our future BLA submission or if prior to the BLA submission, the FDA finds that we do not meet the conditions for the enforcement discretion terms or are not exercising due diligence in executing the transition plan. If final action on the BLA is negative or we are found to not meet the conditions for the transition plan or its execution, or if FDA were to revoke the enforcement discretion for any other reason, we may not be able to continue to distribute Avance Nerve Graft. We continue to work diligently to execute the transition plan, including maintaining regular communication with the FDA, and, in this context, continue to distribute Avance Nerve Graft.
We met with the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ("CBER") in July 2010 and, between July 2010 and November 2010, provided information to CBER that resulted in the FDA issuing a letter stating the agency’s intent to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to the continued introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of Avance Nerve Graft assuming that certain conditions are met relating to the transition of Avance Nerve Graft from regulation as an HCT/P under Section 361 to a biological product under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. Specifically, the FDA transition plan outlined that:
•We transition to compliance with Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act, the current cGMP regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and the applicable regulations and standards in 21 CFR Parts 600-610 prior to initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of Avance Nerve Graft.
◦We have performed several gap analyses of our quality system for compliance with 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations. The gap analyses have identified areas in which our quality system could improve with respect to compliance with the regulations. The transition is in process and we periodically review the 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations to ensure that we create and implement appropriate changes, including new quality procedures. Through our internal auditing process, we periodically assess our compliance to the regulations. As we complete the BLA submission, we will retain an external audit consultant with experience in auditing to 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 regulations to verify quality system compliance with the regulations.
•We conduct a phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety, purity and potency of Avance Nerve Graft under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”). We and the FDA agreed to the SPA in August 2011. 
◦In accordance with FDA regulations in 21 CFR §Part 312, we submitted IND #15419 to the FDA and it became effective in March 2015.
◦The phase 3 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2015. The study completed initial enrollment in January 2019. As required by the SPA and agreed to by FDA and us, an independent statistical analysis was conducted to determine if greater study enrollment was appropriate to maintain the planned statistical power of the trial. As part of that review, the targeted enrollment was increased to 220 subjects, and the number of participating centers was increased to up to 25. The study completed subject enrollment in July 2020. Subject follow-up was completed in August 2021 with topline study data read-out completed during the second quarter of 2022. Topline results showed that this pivotal study met its primary endpoint for the return of nerve function as measured by static two-point discrimination. It also demonstrated that the safety profile was consistent with previously published data. RECON results demonstrated statistical superiority for return of sensory function, as measured by static two-point discrimination, as compared to conduits in gaps greater 
Table of Content

than 12 mm (p-value <0.05). Avance demonstrated statistical superiority for time to recover of static two-point discrimination over conduits in nerve gaps greater than 10mm (p-value <0.05). 
•We continue to comply with the regulations and standards under 21 CFR Part 1271.
◦We were audited by the FDA at the Avance Processing Facility in March 2013, March 2015, October 2016 and September 2022 and at the Avance Distribution Facility in October 2015 with respect to its Human Tissue Quality System under 21 CFR Part 1271 and in July 2022 with respect to Level 1 Quality System Inspection Technique ("QSIT") Medical Device Inspection under 21 CFR 820. At each inspection, the quality systems were found to be in compliance with 21 CFR Part 1271 and no FDA Form 483 observations were issued.
◦In February 2018. we were audited by the FDA with respect to its Medical Device Quality System under 21 CFR Part 820 and its Human Tissue Quality System under 21 CFR Part 1271. Such audit resulted in two Form 483 observations on general procedures on our Medical Device Quality System and no Form 483 observations on our Human Tissue Quality System. We took corrective action to correct these observations and the FDA has accepted the corrective action plan.
◦In November 2018, we were audited again by the FDA at our Distribution Facility with respect to our Human Tissue Quality System under 21 CFR Part 1271. Such audit resulted in one Form 483 observation on tissue tracking. We took corrective action to correct this observation and the FDA has accepted the corrective action plan.
We are working with the FDA to ensure compliance with applicable regulations regarding the transition of our quality system to 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 and 600-610 compliance and through audits for compliance to 21 CFR Part 1271. 
We engage in regular communication with the FDA regarding the IND and regulatory compliance. FDA will review our regulatory compliance during the pre-license inspection as part of the BLA review. If the FDA does not find us to be in compliance, the BLA might not be approved or could be delayed.
The BLA for Avance Nerve Graft, if approved, will require a potentially substantial user fee payment to the FDA, although certain exemptions, waivers and discounts of the user fees may apply, including certain waivers or discounts for small businesses.
In September 2018, the FDA granted a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy ("RMAT") designation for Avance Nerve Graft. A regenerative medicine therapy is eligible for the RMAT designation if it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. The RMAT designation provides access to a streamlined approval process for regenerative medicine technologies and informal meetings with the FDA in support of the BLA for Avance Nerve Graft, as appropriate. FDA can withdraw the RMAT designation if the designation criteria are no longer met.
We believe that any future, competitive peripheral nerve allograft would be required to follow the standard pathway for biologic licensing, which typically entails multiple clinical trials and takes many years. The FDA provided updated guidance, "Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use" in November 2017, which it revised in July 2020. The guidance clarified the FDA's position that any processing that alters the biological characteristics of peripheral nerve tissue would be considered more than minimal manipulation, and therefore require a BLA prior to marketing.
We have maintained a collaborative dialogue with the FDA and will continue to work with the FDA as we progress towards our BLA submission. If our BLA submission is approved, we believe Avance Nerve Graft will have 12 years of reference product exclusivity with regard to potential biosimilars with Avance Nerve Graft being designated as the Reference Product.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are a category of clinical research designed to evaluate and test new interventions, medications, or procedures. Clinical trials are often conducted in four phases. The trials at each phase have a different purpose and help answer different questions.
•Phase I trials test an experimental drug or treatment in a small group of people for the first time. The researchers evaluate the treatment’s safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. 
Table of Content

•In Phase II trials, the experimental drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective and to further evaluate its safety.
•In Phase III trials, the experimental study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people. Researchers aim to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely. 
•Phase IV trials, also known as Post-marketing studies, are conducted after a treatment is approved for use by the FDA, and provide additional information including the treatment or drug’s risks, benefits, and best use.
Clinical trials are required to support a BLA or PMA and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance or de novo classification. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under strict requirements to ensure the protection of human subjects participating in the trial and under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring and safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials for biological products require the submission and FDA acceptance of an IND and clinical trials for medical devices require the submission and FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption ("IDE") application unless the device regulations provide for an exemption from the IDE requirement. Clinical trials for significant risk devices may not begin until the IDE is approved by the FDA and the IRB overseeing the particular clinical trial. If the product is considered a non-significant risk device under FDA regulations, the trial must only be approved by an IRB prior to its initiation. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND or IDE, for significant risk devices. In addition, for these studies, an IRB at each site at which the study is conducted must approve the protocol, subject consent form and any amendments for each site at which the study is conducted. All research subjects must be informed, among other things, about the risks and benefits of the investigational product and provide their informed consent in writing.
Clinical trials under an IND typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In our case, we believe that the phase 3 clinical trial study for Avance Nerve Graft represents the only prospective clinical data that will be required to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve comparison with placebo, standard treatments, or other comparators. Usually, multiple well-controlled large phase 3 or pivotal clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy are required to support a BLA. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk, have experienced a serious and unexpected adverse event, or that continued use in an investigational setting may be unethical. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of research, for example, if the research is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the research has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally clinical data obtained from the observational study, RANGER, will be provided as supportive safety data.
Our Clinical Trials
We have an active clinical research program to gather data on our product portfolio. We have completed three clinical studies, are performing six ongoing clinical studies, and have plans to initiate further clinical studies. The ongoing studies are: 
•“A Multicenter Retrospective Study of Avance Nerve Graft Utilization, Evaluations, and Outcomes in Peripheral Nerve Injury Repair (“RANGER”),"
•"A Matched Autograft and Tube Conduit Case Control Cohort Arm of RANGER ("MATCH"),"
•"Breast Neurotization Outcomes for Women: A Registry Study of Recovery Outcomes, Quality of Life and Patient Satisfaction in Post-Mastectomy Autologous Breast Reconstruction ("Sensation-NOW")," 
•"A Multicenter, Prospective and Subject Blinded Comparative Study of Axoguard Nerve Cap and Neurectomy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Neuroma and Prevention of Recurrent End-Neuroma Pain ("REPOSE")," 
•"Tolerability and Feasibility Pilot Clinical Study of a Large-Diameter Nerve Cap for Protecting and Preserving Terminated Nerve Ends ("REPOSE-XL")," and
•"An Ambispective, Multicenter, Observational Registry Study of Patients Considering Surgical Treatment for Chronic Neuropathic Pain ("Rethink Pain")." 
Table of Content

Our completed studies are "A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Patient and Evaluator Blinded Comparative Study of Nerve Cuffs and Avance Nerve Graft Evaluating Recovery Outcomes for the Repair of Nerve Discontinuities (“RECON”)," “A Multicenter, Prospective, Randomized, Comparative Study of Hollow Nerve Conduit and Avance Nerve Graft Evaluation Recovery Outcomes of the Nerve Repair in the Hand (“CHANGE”)” published by Means et al and a pilot study to evaluate the use of Avance Nerve Graft in the reconstruction of nerves following prostatectomy.
In addition to these clinical research programs, we are developing additional clinical trials in peripheral nerve repair, including mixed and motor nerve repair, breast neurotization and pain.
Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to, those relating to Good Clinical Practices. We are also required to obtain the patients’ written, informed consent in a form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the biological product or device, or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. Similarly, in the E.U., the clinical study for a medicine product must be authorized by the Competent Authority in each Member State where the clinical trial is to be conducted and must receive a favorable opinion from an ethics committee. See "Risk Factors - Clinical trials can be long, expensive and results are ultimately uncertain, which could jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval and continue to market our Avance Nerve Graft product."
RANGER
The RANGER study is an observational study currently in enrollment and is a utilization registry of Avance Nerve Graft. As of December 31, 2022, eleven publications and more than 70 scientific conference presentations have been generated to date from the study. RANGER is designed to allow up to 2,500 subjects. An additional 500 subjects are allowed to be enrolled in Addendum 1, MATCH, and 2,000 enrolled in Addendum 2, Sensation-NOW. Sensation-NOW is a clinical study cohort designed to assess breast sensation following reconstruction with or without neurotization. We resumed enrollment in 2021 at select centers after pausing enrollment due to COVID-19 in 2020. The follow-up for the RANGER study is standard of care with a target of up to 36 months post peripheral nerve repair. At the time of BLA submission for Avance Nerve Graft, we will provide to the FDA Real World Evidence based primarily on Real World Data from the RANGER study data for all qualifying peripheral nerve repairs. 
The RANGER study database is also utilized to monitor different nerve repair techniques. As part of this, we utilize the database to support additional regulatory submissions for the Axoguard products.
We have worked with leading institutions, researchers, and surgeons to support innovation in the field of surgical peripheral nerve repair. We believe that RANGER is currently the largest multi-center observational clinical study conducted in peripheral nerve gap repair. Various reviewers of the RANGER study have found Avance Nerve Graft nerve repairs resulted in meaningful motor and sensory recovery and reduced pain following neuroma excision and reconstruction with no safety concerns identified. 
RECON
The RECON study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, patient and evaluator blinded, comparative study of Avance Nerve Graft and Collagen Nerve Cuffs (manufactured conduits) in the repair of peripheral nerve transections in digital nerves with gaps of 5 to 25mm. The study is designed to assess the outcomes of peripheral nerve repair in approximately 170 subjects in up to 20 centers. Subjects were intraoperatively randomized in a 1:1 ratio after stratification by length of the nerve injury by gap length into short gap (5-14mm) and long gap (15-25mm) categories. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Avance Nerve Graft for non-inferiority and if met, superiority, of static two-point discrimination, a measure of sensory function, at twelve months as compared to nerve cuffs. Given the pooled standard deviation assumptions and a non-inferiority margin of 2mm, approximately 88 patients per treatment group are required to assess non-inferiority with at least 83% power. In addition to non-inferiority, a minimum treatment effect is required to be demonstrated. Based on an agreement with the FDA in the original protocol and an independent statistical analysis of the pooled standard deviation, the number of subjects was increased to 220 in up to 25 centers. Subjects were followed over the course of 12 months (based on the agreed-upon protocol, subjects have up to an additional three months to complete trial requirements) to assess safety and efficacy outcomes with assessments performed at various defined intervals up to 12 months. The study completed subject enrollment in July 2020. Subject follow-up was completed in August 2021with topline study data read-out completed during the second quarter of 2022. Topline results showed that this pivotal study met its primary endpoint for the return of nerve function

as measured by static two-point discrimination. It also demonstrated that the safety profile was consistent with previously published data. RECON results demonstrated statistical superiority for return of sensory function, as measured by static two-point discrimination, as compared to conduits in gaps greater than 12 mm (p-value <0.05). Avance demonstrated statistical superiority for time to recover of static two-point discrimination over conduits in nerve gaps greater than 10mm (p-value <0.05). The data in this study will support our BLA submission, which we expect to file with FDA in 2023.
REPOSE
We are conducting a multicenter, prospective, randomized, and subject blinded study of Axoguard Nerve Cap as compared to neurectomy for the treatment of systematic neuroma ("REPOSE"). REPOSE is a two-phase study comparing standard neurectomy to Axoguard Nerve Cap, which leverages our chambered technology to aid in the management of symptomatic neuromas. The first phase, a non-randomized pilot has completed enrollment and one-year follow-up. The second phase, a prospective, randomized controlled study, completed enrollment in 2022. Overall enrollment is designed to target 101 subjects with 15 in the first pilot phase followed by up to 86 in the randomized, comparative phase. The study will assess pain scores, quality of life, neuroma recurrence, and health outcomes over a 12-month follow-up period. Subject follow-up is expected in the third quarter of 2023. 
REPOSE XL
REPOSE-XL is a prospective, multi-center clinical pilot study evaluating the tolerability and feasibility of the Axoguard Large-Diameter Nerve Cap (sizes 5-7 mm) for protecting and preserving terminated nerve endings after limb trauma or amputation when immediate attention to the nerve injuries is not possible. Enrollment in REPOSE-XL started in 2022. 
Rethink Pain
Rethink Pain is a prospective and retrospective, multicenter, observational clinical study of patients considering surgical treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. Enrollment resumed in 2021 after pausing in 2020 due to COVID-19. Rethink Pain evaluates a patient's healthcare journey and pain history through detailed medical history and record review. For patients who undergo surgical treatment for pain, standardized outcome measures such as post-operative pain, pain medication usage, quality of life outcomes, and functional outcome of associated nerves as compared to pre-operative levels will be assessed.
Post-Market Regulatory Requirements
There are numerous regulatory requirements that apply after a product is cleared or approved. For medical devices, these include, but are not limited to the FDA’s regulations for device labeling (21 CFR Part 801), medical device reporting (21 CFR Part 803), reporting of corrections and removals (21 CFR Part 806), establishment of registration and device listing requirements (21 CFR Part 807), and compliance with the QSR per 21 CFR Part 820. Distribution of medical devices is also subject to license/registration requirements in some states. For tissue and biological products, the regulatory requirements include: the FDA’s registration and listing requirements, donor eligibility requirements and compliance with GTP in 21 CFR Part 1271 for human tissue products, compliance with the FDA’s cGMP in 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, and 600 for licensed biological products, and post-market BLA requirements (21 CFR Part 601), including The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Among other things, these regulations require manufacturers, including third party manufacturers to:
•Follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
•Comply with labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the false or misleading promotion or the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses, or indications;
•Comply with requirements to obtain clearance or approval for certain changes affecting the product, including changes to the product’s manufacturing, labeling, or intended use;
•Report to the FDA certain adverse events, adverse reactions, and deviations;
•Comply with post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments and post-market safety and annual reporting requirements;
•Follow post-market surveillance regulations that may apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; and
•Follow requirements to issue notices of correction or removal, or conduct market withdrawals, or recalls where quality or other issues arise.

Safety Reporting and other Periodic Reporting
We have not received any reports of adverse events where the event was determined to be product related for Avance Nerve Graft or Avive Soft Tissue Membrane products. Although we have voluntarily suspended marketing of Avive, the suspension was not due to a recall or any safety concerns. Nine adverse events have been reported by Cook Biotech for the Axoguard products (one each in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2020; and two each in 2017 and 2019). We reported three biological deviations (two in 2018 and one in 2019) for quality system issues related to human tissue distribution (no patient safety issues were involved). In December 2020, a user facility presented a Medwatch report for Avance Nerve Graft for a sizing issue and potential delay in procedure. Our follow-up indicated that there was no delay in procedure and we filed information with the FDA and no further action is required. We have not had to submit any Medical Device Reports (“MDRs”) or tissue adverse reaction reports to the FDA. Although the Axoguard connector and protector product lines have had just nine adverse events reported to date, there may have been other incidents, including patient deaths, that may have occurred during procedures utilizing our products without us being aware of any such incidents. In addition, there can be no assurance that in the future our products will not cause or contribute to an adverse event that would require us to submit MDRs, biological deviation reports, or tissue adverse reaction reports to the FDA . IND annual reporting remains in compliance. 
In addition to the FDA, the advertising and promotion of medical products are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and in some instances by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, some promotional activities for FDA-regulated products have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the Federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors, and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims.
Facilities Listing and Registrations
All of our facilities are properly registered with the FDA as tissue or medical device establishments. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the GTP, GMP, and other regulations, and these inspections may also include suppliers' manufacturing facilities.
Failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other federal or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions, among others:
•Warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•Customer notifications, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;
•Operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
•Suspension or termination of our clinical trials;
•Refusing our 501(k), de novo classification request, PMA or BLA for new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
•Withdrawing or suspending pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and
•Criminal prosecution.
Education Grants, U.S. Anti-kickback, False Claims and Other Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
Educational Grants
A medical product manufacturer may provide financial or in-kind support, including support by way of grants, to third parties for the purpose of conducting medical educational activities. If these supported activities are considered by the FDA to be independent of the manufacturer, then the activities fall outside the FDA restrictions on promotion to which the manufacturer is subject.
We seek to ensure that the educational activities we support through our grants program are in accordance with the appropriate criteria for independent educational activities. However, we cannot provide assurance that the FDA or other government authorities would view the programs supported as being independent.
Fraud, Abuse and False Claims
We are directly and indirectly subject to various federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws. In particular, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and 
Table of Content

Medicaid programs. Penalties for violations could include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. In implementing the statute, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued a series of regulations, known as “safe harbors.” These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute for activities that fit within a safe harbor. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable element of a safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG, and may be “at risk” activities unless a favorable advisory opinion is obtained from the OIG.
The Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil liability on any person or entity that submits, or causes the submission of, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. Damages under the FCA can be significant and consist of the imposition of fines and penalties. The FCA also allows a private individual or entity with knowledge of past or present fraud against the federal government to sue on behalf of the government to recover the civil penalties and treble damages. The U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") has previously alleged that the marketing and promotional practices of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers including the off-label promotion of products or the payment of prohibited kickbacks to doctors violated the FCA resulting in the submission of improper claims to federal and state healthcare entitlement programs such as Medicaid. 
AdvaMed is one of the primary voluntary U.S. trade associations for medical device manufacturers. PhRMA is another global trade association focused on the pharmaceutical industry. These associations have established guidelines and protocols for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, respectively, in their relationships with healthcare professionals on matters, including research and development, product training and education, grants and charitable contributions, support of third-party educational conferences, and consulting arrangements. Adoption of the AdvaMed or PhRMA Codes by a medical device manufacturer is voluntary, and while the OIG and other federal and state healthcare regulatory agencies encourage its adoption, they do not view adoption of these codes as proof of compliance with applicable laws. Key to the underlying principles of the AdvaMed and PhRMA Codes is the need to focus the relationships between manufacturers and healthcare professionals on matters of training, education and scientific research, and limit payments between manufacturers and healthcare professionals to fair market value for legitimate services provided and payment of modest meal, travel, and other expenses for a healthcare professional under limited circumstances. We have incorporated these principles into our relationships with healthcare professionals under our consulting agreements, payment of travel and lodging expenses, research and educational grant procedures and sponsorship of third-party conferences. In addition, we have conducted and will continue to conduct training sessions on these principles. Finally, the Sunshine Act, as defined below, imposes additional reporting and disclosure requirements on us for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as reporting of certain physician ownership interests. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory or enforcement authorities will view our relationships with physicians or policies as being in compliance with applicable regulations and laws.

Regulation Outside of the U.S.
Distribution and sales of medical products outside of the U.S. are subject to foreign governmental regulations that vary substantially from country to country. 
There are restrictions under U.S. law on the export of medical devices and biological products that cannot be legally distributed in the U.S. The FDA has set forth certain requirements for the export of devices outside of the U.S. depending on the class of device and its FDA approval. We currently believe we comply with applicable regulations when exporting our products and we intend to continue such compliance in the event there are any regulatory changes regarding its products in the U.S.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is the decentralized body of the European Union, located in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. It is responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision, and safety monitoring of medicines for human and veterinary use in the EU. The EMA serves the EU and three countries from the European Economic Area (EEA)—Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. The EU has adopted numerous directives, regulations, and promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture and labeling of, and clinical trials and adverse event reporting for medicinal products including medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant regulation or directive will be entitled to bear CE marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable regulation and directives and can be commercially distributed throughout the member states of the E.U. and other countries that comply. The method for assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the device, but normally involves an assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. Such an assessment is required for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. In the second quarter of 2014, Axogen’s Quality System became registered to ISO 13485 for Receipt, Handling, Storage and Distribution of Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector and we will maintain the registration through 2023.
Cook Biotech is responsible for all regulatory filings for the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector products, including international registrations. We provide the countries for Cook Biotech to register with, and Cook Biotech prepares and submits the product filing documentation to the Ministry of Health (“MOH”) for the country. Each country or region has its own regulations and the documentation required for submission varies. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the project to obtain clearance in a given country or region. To date, the Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector product lines were registered in May 2013 in Canada for distribution and in April 2013 the product lines were awarded the CE Mark allowing distribution into the E.U. and other countries that accept the CE Mark. Cook Biotech received the renewal of the CE Mark for Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector in May 2021.
In addition, the new European Medical Device Regulation (“E.U. MDR”) passed in the European Parliament on April 5, 2017 and went into effect on May 25, 2017. The E.U. MDR is an extensive reform of the rules governing the medical device industry in Europe. Under this regulation, manufacturers had through May 2021 to comply with a broad set of new rules for almost every kind of medical device. The E.U. MDR requires changes in the clinical evidence required for medical devices, post-market clinical follow-up evidence, annual reporting of safety information for Class III products, and bi-annual reporting for Class II products, Unique Device Identification (“UDI”) for all products, submission of core data elements to a European UDI database prior to placement of a device on the market, reclassification of medical devices, and multiple other labeling changes.
Overall, medical device companies can expect longer lead times to obtain product registrations (i.e., CE Mark Certification) in the E.U. and a substantially costlier pathway to compliance in the E.U. We are not yet able to determine the costs of complying with these regulations, how the E.U. will interpret and enforce them, what the timelines for approvals of products will be and the overall effect of the E.U. MDR on the marketplace. Given the significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements imposed by the E.U. MDR, the overall impact of these new rules could have a material, adverse effect on our international revenue and expenses.
The UK left the E.U. in January 2020. We register our human tissue products in each individual E.U. country and our distributor in the UK has import authority for our human tissue product. It is expected that licensed UK establishments that import or export tissues or cells will need written agreements with the relevant E.U. licensed establishments to continue importing and exporting with the E.U. As we ship directly to the UK from the U.S., we did not experience and do not expect delays in shipment of human tissue products into the UK. Further, the RANGER clinical trial being performed at select hospitals in the UK was not affected by Brexit (defined below in "Risk Factors - Regulation Outside of the U.S.") as long as the products continue to come directly from the U.S. Beginning in January 2021, new changes became effective as the transition period for the UK’s exit from the E.U. ended. Specifically, all medical devices placed into the UK market had to be registered, subject to applicable grace periods, with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA"), will need to 
Table of Content

appoint a UK Responsible Person, and comply with additional product marking and conformity assessment requirements. Medical devices must be registered with the MHRA if they are being placed in the UK market after May 1, 2021. Cook Biotech is responsible for appointing the UK Responsible Person and registering Axoguard Nerve Connector and Axoguard Nerve Protector in the UK.
Tissue products are not currently regulated under the CE Mark
We are responsible for all regulatory filings for Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane (which we have voluntarily suspended from the domestic market). To obtain international approvals, we prepare the product filing documentation and submit this documentation to the MOH for a country.
Although some standards of harmonization exist, each country in which we conduct business has its own specific regulatory requirements, which are dynamic in nature and continually changing. We procure and process our tissue for the Avance Nerve Graft and Avive Soft Tissue Membrane in the U.S. and markets the Avance Nerve Graft in Canada, the UK, and certain other countries under compliance with the individual country regulations. We conduct a regulatory review at the time of submission of the product dossier. This involves reviewing the appropriate MOH regulations, discussion with in-country distributors and use of consultants. It typically takes less than nine months from the initiation of the product to develop a product dossier (specific for that country), submission of the documentation and MOH review of the product filing. While we believe that we are in compliance with all existing pertinent international and domestic laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in governmental administrations and regulations will not negatively impact our operations. Avive Soft Tissue Membrane has received regulatory registration allowing for distribution in Canada, Switzerland, UK, and Austria but we do not distribute Avive Soft Tissue Membrane in those countries at this time.The FDA and international regulatory bodies conduct periodic compliance inspections of our U.S. processing facilities. All of our locations are properly registered with CBER as tissue establishments. Other than our APC facility, which AATB will inspect along with all other facilities to bring it under our accreditation certificate in 2023, we are accredited by the AATB and is licensed in the states of Florida, New York, California, Maryland, Delaware, Oregon, and Illinois. We officially notified AATB that the APC facility came online in November of 2022. We believe that worldwide regulation of tissue products is likely to intensify as the international regulatory community focuses on the growing demand for these implant products and the attendant safety and efficacy issues of recipients. Changes in governing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our management further believes that it can help to mitigate this exposure by continuing to work closely with government and industry regulators.
Environmental
As a biotech company of our size, we believe our impact on the environment is modest. However, we are continuously evaluating how we can be the best possible stewards of the environment, and follow local, state, and federal environmental regulations. We are taking steps in our operations and facilities to positively impact the environment wherever possible. In 2022, we conducted a new environmental analysis of all our operations and have implemented the following:
•Certain recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures.
•An environmental monitoring program by location.
•Evaluation and launching new recycling initiatives and programs.
•Working toward ISO 14001 certification, which sets out criteria for an environmental management system.
Our products, as well as the chemicals used in processing these products, are handled and disposed of in accordance with country-specific, federal, state, and local environmental regulations. Since 2007, we have used outside third parties to perform all biohazard waste disposal.
We contract with independent, third parties to perform sterilization of our allografts. Because of the engagement of a third party to perform irradiation services, the requirements for compliance with radiation hazardous waste do not apply, and therefore we do not anticipate that this engagement will have any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial condition. However, we are responsible for assuring that the service is performed in accordance with applicable regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of penalties, fines or sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 396 total employees, including approximately 2 part-time employees and 394 full-time employees. Of these employees, 214 work in sales and marketing, 78 work in corporate, 44 work in research and development and 60 work in operations. Approximately 43% of our employees were female and 57% were male. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we have not had a work stoppage and no employees are represented by a labor union.
We believe in creating and maintaining a culture that encourages and rewards honesty, openness, and passionate debate among our employees, respect is the foundation for communication and action, and patient safety is our first priority We are committed to fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our corporate values support honest and open communication, mutual support, collaboration, passionate debate, empowerment, and respect. Our Equal Employment Policy includes specific training on preventing discrimination and harassment and encourages diversity, equity, and inclusion. We also have an annual Affirmative Action Plan, which is actively implemented and reviewed with management and our Board of Directors and. following such review, adjusted as needed to meet changing conditions. We are committed to advertising our opportunities on each state's job boards in order to reach an increasingly diverse population of candidates, and we conduct routine audits of our existing job postings, advertisements and candidate communications for gender coding, and update any gender specific language to gender neutral language. Additionally, we have a policy that supports employees who are veterans that participate in Honors Guards, who are selected from partnerships with veteran organizations and participating companies and attend by invitation, and military funerals, the Honor Guards. Further, some of our recruitment efforts are to engage with the next generation of scientists and engineers through targeted awareness and internship programs. We work with Women in Life Sciences, Society for Asian Scientists and Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, and BioFlorida to educate students and professionals about career opportunities available at our Company.
In order to attract and retain talent, we combine a market competitive compensation and benefit package that includes base and incentive compensation in addition to opportunity to participate in long-term incentive program.

We also offer all employees the opportunity to enroll in leadership and career development programs and support external development through continuing education. We provide employees with individual career development plans focused on developing specific skills, including a mix of on-the-job training, advanced external training, stretch assignments, mentoring, and coaching resources. Employees actively participate in annual job performance review. Additionally, we encourage external professional networking, conference, and trade show participation. 
All employees are offered the opportunity to contribute to an employee engagement survey annually and, as a result of the survey responses, we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory. Employee safety is critical to our operations, and we follow Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910, and use a series of company-wide policies, trainings, and procedures to protect all employees’ health and safety. We utilize an Environmental Health and Safety committee that meets monthly to analyze potential issues, review any incident data, and implement necessary process or procedural changes that can minimize the work-related injuries and occupational exposure to chemicals, bio-hazards, or illnesses, and eliminate any potential from serious injuries and fatalities. In 2022, across all operations, locations, and employees, we had nine minor injuries or illnesses, only one of which was OSHA reportable, and zero fatalities.
The Compensation Committee of our board of directors (the "Board of Directors") has oversight of our culture and human capital management, including diversity, equity, and inclusion with respect to our employees.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
Below is a summary of our risk factors. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading “Risk Factors” and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.
Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy
•Our revenue growth depends on our ability to increase distribution and sales to existing customers and develop new customers, domestically and abroad, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.
•Our revenue depends primarily on four products, which is dependent on the continued acceptance of our products by the medical community.
•The failure of Silicon Valley Bank, as well as the recent turmoil in the banking industry may negatively impact our business, results or operations and financial condition.
•Macroeconomic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary pressures and political instability could continue to have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments.
•There may be significant fluctuations in our operating results.
•We have not consistently experienced positive cash flow from our operations, and the ability to achieve consistent, positive cash flow from operations will depend on increasing revenue from distribution of our products, which may not be achievable.
•We may not experience the operating efficiencies anticipated with the transition to our APC Facility. We are highly dependent on the continued availability of our facilities and could be harmed if the facilities are unavailable for any prolonged period of time.
•Delays, interruptions, or the cessation of production by our third-party suppliers of important materials may prevent or delay our ability to manufacture or process the final products.
•Surgical technique evolution, technological change and competition could reduce demand for our products.
•We must maintain high quality processing of our products.
•Our revenue depends upon prompt and adequate reimbursement from public and private insurers and national health systems.
•Negative publicity concerning methods of donating human tissue and screening of donated tissue may reduce demand for our products and negatively impact the supply of available donor tissue.
•The failure of third parties to perform many necessary services for the commercialization of our products, including services related to recovery/acquisition, distribution and transportation, would impair our ability to meet commercial demand.
•We are dependent on our relationships with independent agencies to generate a material portion of our revenue.
•If we do not manage product inventory in an effective and efficient manner, it could adversely affect profitability resulting in significant fluctuations in our operating results.
•Our operating results could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage and sustain our future growth or scale our operations.
•We may be unsuccessful in commercializing our products outside the U.S.
Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment in which We Operate 
•Our Avance Nerve Graft product is currently distributed pursuant to enforcement discretion and a transition plan with the FDA and we expect to file our BLA by the end of 2023. If our BLA is not approved by the FDA or the use of Avance Nerve Graft is curtailed, our revenues would significantly decrease which would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
•Our operations must comply with and our business is subject to continuing regulatory compliance by the FDA and other authorities, which is costly and could result in negative effects on our business.
•We have suspended market availability of our Avive Soft Tissue Membrane and there is no guarantee it will be placed back on the market.
•The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or the image of our products and could result in injuries leading to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in FDA sanctions.

Risks Related to Financing Our Business 
•Our credit facility and payment obligations under the Revenue Participation Agreement with TPC Investments II LP and Argo SA LLC, each affiliates of Oberland Capital (collectively, “Oberland Capital”), contains operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities, require cash payments over an extended period of time and are subject to acceleration in specified circumstances, which may result in Oberland Capital taking possession and disposing of any collateral.
•We may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital or operating needs, which could have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, and the interests of our shareholders.
