 Unitil had an investment in Net Utility Plant of $1,036.8 million at December 31, 2018. Unitils total operating revenue was $444.1 million in 2018. Unitils operating revenue is substantially derived from regulated natural gas and electric distribution utility operations. A fifth utility subsidiary, Unitil Power, 
 
3 


  formerly functioned as the full requirements wholesale power supply provider for Unitil Energy, but currently has limited business and operating activities. In connection with the implementation of electric industry restructuring in New Hampshire, Unitil Power ceased being the wholesale supplier of Unitil Energy in 2003 and divested of substantially all of its long-term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity associated with those contracts. 
 Unitil also has three other wholly-owned non-utility subsidiaries: Unitil Service, Unitil Realty and Unitil Resources. Unitil Service provides, at cost, a variety of administrative and professional services, including regulatory, financial, accounting, human resources, engineering, operations, technology and energy supply management services on a centralized basis to its affiliated Unitil companies. Unitil Realty owns and manages the Companys corporate office in Hampton, New Hampshire. Unitil Resources is the Companys wholly-owned non-regulated subsidiary. Usource, Inc. and Usource L.L.C. (collectively, Usource) are indirect subsidiaries that are wholly-owned by Unitil Resources. Usource provides energy brokering and advisory services to a national client base of large commercial and industrial customers. For segment information relating to each segments revenue, earnings and assets, see Note 3 (Segment Information) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this report. All of the Companys revenues are attributable to customers in the United States of America and all its long-lived assets are located in the United States of America. 
 OPERATIONS 
 Natural Gas Operations 
 Unitils natural gas operations include gas distribution utility operations and interstate gas transmission pipeline operations, discussed below. Revenue from Unitils gas operations was $216.1 million for 2018, which represents about 49% of Unitils total operating revenue. 
Natural Gas Distribution Utility Operations 
 Unitils natural gas distribution operations are conducted through two of the Companys operating utilities, Northern Utilities and Fitchburg. The primary business of Unitils natural gas utility operations is the local distribution of natural gas to customers in its service territories in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine. Northern Utilities C&I customers and Fitchburgs residential and C&I customers are entitled to purchase their natural gas supply from third-party competitive suppliers, while Northern Utilities or Fitchburg remains their gas distribution company. Both Northern Utilities and Fitchburg supply gas to those customers who do not obtain their supply from third-party competitive suppliers, with the approved costs associated with this gas supply being recovered on a pass-through basis through regulated reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted. 
 Natural gas is distributed by Northern Utilities to 66,786 customers in 44 New Hampshire and southern Maine communities, from Plaistow, New Hampshire in the south to the city of Portland, Maine and then extending to Lewiston-Auburn, Maine in the north. Northern Utilities has a diversified customer base both in Maine and New Hampshire. Commercial businesses include healthcare, education, government and retail. Northern Utilities industrial base includes manufacturers in the auto, housing, rubber, printing, textile, pharmaceutical, electronics, wire and food production industries as well as a military installation. Northern Utilities 2018 gas operating revenue was $174.4 million, of which approximately 38% was derived from residential firm sales and 62% from C&I firm sales. 
 Natural gas is distributed by Fitchburg to 15,973 customers in the communities of Fitchburg, Lunenburg, Townsend, Ashby, Gardner and Westminster, all located in Massachusetts. Fitchburgs industrial customers include paper manufacturing and paper products companies, rubber and plastics manufacturers, chemical products companies and printing, publishing and associated industries. Fitchburgs 2018 gas operating revenue was $35.1 million, of which approximately 58% was derived from residential firm sales and 42% from C&I firm sales. 
 Gas Transmission Pipeline Operations 
 Granite State is an interstate natural gas transmission pipeline company, operating 86 miles of underground gas transmission pipeline primarily located in Maine and New Hampshire. Granite State 
 
4 


  provides Northern Utilities with interconnection to major natural gas pipelines and access to domestic natural gas supplies in the south and Canadian natural gas supplies in the north. Granite State had operating revenue of $6.6 million for 2018. Granite State derives its revenues principally from the transportation services provided to Northern Utilities and to third-party suppliers. 
 Electric Distribution Utility Operations 
 Unitils electric distribution operations are conducted through two of the Companys utilities, Unitil Energy and Fitchburg. Revenue from Unitils electric utility operations was $223.3 million for 2018, which represents about 50% of Unitils total operating revenue. 
 The primary business of Unitils electric utility operations is the local distribution of electricity to customers in its service territory in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. All of Unitil Energys and Fitchburgs electric customers are entitled to choose to purchase their supply of electricity from third-party competitive suppliers, while Unitil Energy or Fitchburg remains their electric distribution company. Both Unitil Energy and Fitchburg supply electricity to those customers who do not obtain their supply from third-party competitive suppliers, with the approved costs associated with electricity supply being recovered on a pass-through basis through regulated reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted. 
 Unitil Energy distributes electricity to 76,061 customers in New Hampshire in the capital city of Concord as well as parts of 12 surrounding towns and all or part of 18 towns in the southeastern and seacoast regions of New Hampshire, including the towns of Hampton, Exeter, Atkinson and Plaistow. Unitil Energys service territory consists of approximately 408 square miles. In addition, Unitil Energys service territory encompasses retail trading and recreation centers for the central and southeastern parts of the state and includes the Hampton Beach recreational area. These areas serve diversified commercial and industrial businesses, including manufacturing firms engaged in the production of electronic components, wire and plastics, healthcare and education. Unitil Energys 2018 electric operating revenue was $158.6 million, of which approximately 56% was derived from residential sales and 44% from C&I sales. 
 Fitchburg is engaged in the distribution of both electricity and natural gas in the greater Fitchburg area of north central Massachusetts. Fitchburgs service territory encompasses approximately 170 square miles. Electricity is distributed by Fitchburg to 29,510 customers in the communities of Fitchburg, Ashby, Townsend and Lunenburg. Fitchburgs industrial customers include paper manufacturing and paper products companies, rubber and plastics manufacturers, chemical products companies, printing, publishing and associated industries and educational institutions. Fitchburgs 2018 electric operating revenue was $64.7 million, of which approximately 59% was derived from residential sales and 41% from C&I sales. 
 Seasonality 
 The Companys results of operations are expected to reflect the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Annual gas revenues are substantially realized during the colder weather seasons of the year as a result of higher sales of natural gas used for heating related purposes. Accordingly, the results of operations are historically most favorable in the first and fourth quarters. Fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions may have a significant effect on the result of operations. Sales of electricity are generally less sensitive to weather than natural gas sales, but may also be affected by the weather conditions and the temperature in both the winter and summer seasons. 
 Unitil Energy, Fitchburg and Northern Utilities are not dependent on a single customer or a few customers for their electric and natural gas sales. 
 Non-Regulated and Other Non-Utility Operations 
 Unitils non-regulated operations are conducted through Usource, a subsidiary of Unitil Resources. Usource provides energy brokering and advisory services to a national client base of large commercial and industrial customers. Revenue from Unitils non-regulated operations was $4.7 million in 2018. 
 The results of Unitils other non-utility subsidiaries, Unitil Service and Unitil Realty, and the holding company, are included in the Companys consolidated results of operations. The results of these non-utility

5 


  operations are principally derived from income earned on short-term investments and real property owned for Unitils and its subsidiaries use and are reported, after intercompany eliminations, in Other segment income. For segment information, see Note 3 (Segment Information) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this report. 
 RATES AND REGULATION 
 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 
 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law. Among other things, the TCJA substantially reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Each state public utility commission, with jurisdiction over the areas that are served by Unitils electric and gas subsidiary companies, has issued procedural orders directing how the tax law changes are to be reflected in rates, including requiring that the companies provide certain filings and calculations. Unitil has complied with these orders and has made the required changes to its rates as directed by the commissions. The FERC has opened a rulemaking proceeding on this matter which has been addressed in a rate settlement filing by Granite State (described below). More recently, on November 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and a Policy Statement to address the TCJAs effects on the Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) on transmission rates. Under the proposed rules all public utilities with transmission formula rates, including Fitchburg, would be required to: (1) include mechanisms to deduct any excess ADIT from or add any deficient ADIT to their rate bases; (2) include mechanisms in those rates that would raise or lower their income tax allowances by any amortized excess or deficient ADIT; and (3) incorporate a new permanent worksheet into their rates that will annually track information related to excess or deficient ADIT. The Company believes that these matters are substantially resolved and will not have a material impact on its financial position, operating results, or cash flows. 
 In Maine, Northern Utilities Maine division recently completed a base rate case (described below). The Maine Public Utilities Commissions (MPUC) final order in that docket incorporated the lower tax rates in the calculation of rates for the Company. 
 Similarly, in New Hampshire, Northern Utilities New Hampshire division recently completed a base rate case proceeding (described below). The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commissions (NHPUC) final order in that docket approved a comprehensive settlement agreement among the Company, the Staff of the Public Utilities Commission and the Office of Consumer Advocate which included the effect of the tax changes in the calculation of the revenue requirement. With respect to Unitil Energy, on April 30, 2018 the NHPUC approved the Companys annual step increase pursuant to the provisions of its last base rate case, which included adjustments to account for the TCJAs income tax changes. 
 In Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU) issued an order opening an investigation into the effect on rates of the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate on the MDPUs regulated utilities, and required each utility subject to its jurisdiction to submit proposals to address the effects of the TCJA and to reduce its rates as of January 1, 2018. The MDPU consolidated an earlier petition filed by the Attorney General requesting such an investigation into its order. On June 29, 2018, the MDPU issued an order accepting Fitchburgs proposal to decrease the annual revenue requirement of both its gas and electric divisions by $0.8 million each. On December 21, 2018 the MDPU issued an order addressing the refund of excess ADIT in phase two of its investigation. Fitchburg was ordered to make a filing by January 4, 2019, for rates effective February 1, 2019, to refund $10.1 million for the electric division amortized over 15 years and $10.4 million for the gas division amortized over 14 years. The filing establishes a Tax Act Credit Factor for Fitchburgs gas and electric divisions effective February 1, 2019 in accordance with the order. To the extent any of the regulatory liability above includes excess ADIT amounts specifically associated with reconciling mechanisms, Fitchburg shall return those amounts through the respective reconciling mechanism and adjust the regulatory liability amount accordingly. The MDPU approved this filing on January 16, 2019. 
 On May 2, 2018, Granite State filed an uncontested rate settlement with FERC which accounted for the effects of the TCJA in its rates. The settlement was approved by FERC on June 27, 2018, and complies with and satisfies the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the justness and reasonableness of rates in light of the corporate income tax reduction under the TCJA.

 Base Rate Activity 
 Unitil EnergyBase RatesOn April 20, 2017 the NHPUC approved a permanent increase of $4.1 million in electric base rates, and a three year rate plan with an additional rate step adjustment, effective May 1, 2017, of $0.9 million, followed by two rate step adjustments in May of 2018 and 2019 to recover the revenue requirements associated with annual capital expenditures. On April 30, 2018, the NHPUC approved Unitil Energys step adjustment filing. The filing incorporated the revenue requirement of $3.3 million for 2017 plant additions, a reduction of $2.2 million for the effect of the federal tax decrease pursuant to the TCJA, along with the termination of the one-year $1.4 million reconciliation adjustment which had recouped the difference between temporary rates and final rates. The net effect of the three adjustments resulted in a revenue decrease of $0.3 million. 
 FitchburgBase RatesElectricFitchburgs last base rate order from the MDPU, issued in April 2016, included the approval of an annual capital cost recovery mechanism to recover the revenue requirement associated with certain capital additions. While a number of the capital cost recovery filings may remain pending from year-to-year in any given year, the Company considers these to be routine regulatory proceedings and there are no material issues outstanding. On June 28, 2018, Fitchburg filed its compliance report of capital investments for calendar year 2017. On November 1, 2018, Fitchburg filed its cumulative revenue requirement associated with the Companys 2015, 2016 and 2017 capital expenditures and associated Capital Cost Adjustment Factors to become effective on January 1, 2019. On December 27, 2018, the Capital Cost Adjustment Factors were approved subject to further investigation and reconciliation. This matter remains pending. 
 FitchburgElectric Grid ModernizationOn May 10, 2018, the MDPU issued an order approving a three year grid modernization investment plan for Fitchburg for the period 2018 through 2020 with a spending cap of $4.4 million. The order provides for a cost recovery mechanism for incremental capital investments and operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses. The electric distribution companies in Massachusetts jointly filed compliance filings in August 2018 including 1) revised proposed performance metrics designed to address pre-authorized grid-facing investments, 2) a proposed evaluation plan for the three-year investment term, and 3) a model tariff for cost recovery including proposed protocol for identifying and tracking incremental O&M expenses. Approval of these filings is pending. The next three year investment plan is due July 1, 2020 for the period 2021 through 2023, and is required to include a five year strategic plan for 2021  2025. 
 FitchburgSolar GenerationOn November 9, 2016, the MDPU approved Fitchburgs petition to develop a 1.3 MW solar generation facility located on Company property in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. Construction of the solar generating facility was completed and the facility began generating power on November 22, 2017. On April 2, 2018, Fitchburg submitted its first filing pursuant to its Solar Cost Adjustment tariff, by which the Company recovers its annual revenue requirement related to its investment in the solar generation facility. The filing sought a net amount of approximately $0.3 million for recovery effective June 1, 2018. The recovery of this amount in rates was approved by the MDPU on May 31, 2018, subject to further investigation and reconciliation. A final order is pending. 
 FitchburgBase RatesGasPursuant to the Companys revenue decoupling adjustment clause tariff, as approved in its last base rate case, the Company is allowed to modify, on a semi-annual basis, its base distribution rates to an established revenue per customer target in order to mitigate economic, weather and energy efficiency impacts to the Companys revenues. The MDPU has consistently found that the Companys filings are in accord with its approved tariffs, applicable law and precedent, and that they result in just and reasonable rates. 
 FitchburgGas System Enhancement ProgramPursuant to statute and MDPU order, Fitchburg has an approved Gas System Enhancement Plan (GSEP) tariff through which it may recover certain gas infrastructure replacement and safety related investment costs, subject to an annual cap. Under the plan, the Company is required to make two annual filings with the MDPU: a forward-looking filing for the subsequent construction year, to be filed on or before October 31; and a filing, submitted on or before May 1, of final project documentation for projects completed during the prior year, demonstrating substantial compliance with its plan in effect for that year and showing that project costs were reasonably 
 
7 


  and prudently incurred. While a number of the filings under the GSEP tariff may remain pending from year-to-year in any given year, the Company considers these to be routine regulatory proceedings and there are no material issues outstanding. Under this tariff, a revenue increase of $0.9 million went into effect on May 1, 2018, subject to the annual cap and reconciliation. On October 31, 2018, the MDPU approved the Companys request for a waiver of the annual cap in order to recover its reconciliation adjustment of $0.4 million effective November 1, 2018 associated with its actual 2017 revenue requirement. 
 Northern UtilitiesBase RatesMaineOn February 28, 2018, the MPUC issued its Final Order (Order) in Northern Utilities pending base rate case. The Order provided for an annual revenue increase of $2.1 million before a reduction of $2.2 million to incorporate the effect of the lower federal income tax rate under the TCJA. The MPUC Order approved a return on equity of 9.5 percent and a capital structure reflecting 50 percent equity and 50 percent long-term debt. The Order also provides for a reduction in annual depreciation expense, reducing the Companys annual operating costs by approximately $0.5 million, and addressed a number of other issues, including a change to therm billing, increases in other delivery charges, and cost recovery under the Companys Targeted Area Build-out (TAB) program and Targeted Infrastructure Replacement Adjustment (TIRA) mechanism. The new rates and other changes became effective on March 1, 2018. 
 Northern UtilitiesTargeted Infrastructure Replacement AdjustmentMaineThe settlement in Northern Utilities Maine divisions 2013 rate case allowed the Company to implement a TIRA rate mechanism to adjust base distribution rates annually to recover the revenue requirements associated with targeted investments in gas distribution system infrastructure replacement and upgrade projects, including the Companys Cast Iron Replacement Program (CIRP). The TIRA had an initial term of four years and covered targeted capital expenditures in 2013 through 2016. In its Order in the current base rate case (see above), the MPUC approved an extension of the TIRA mechanism, with adjustment, for an additional eight-year period, which will allow for annual rate adjustments through the end of the CIRP program. On May 7, 2018, the MPUC approved the Companys request to increase its annual base rates by 2.4%, or $1.1 million, to recover the revenue requirements for 2017 eligible facilities. 
 Northern UtilitiesTargeted Area Build-out ProgramMaineIn December 2015, the MPUC approved a TAB program and associated rate surcharge mechanism. This program is designed to allow the economic extension of natural gas mains to new, targeted service areas in Maine. It allows customers in the targeted area the ability to pay a rate surcharge, instead of a large upfront payment or capital contribution to connect to the natural gas delivery system. The initial pilot of the TAB program was approved for the City of Saco, and is being built out over a period of three years, with the potential to add 1,000 new customers and approximately $1 million in annual distribution revenue in the Saco area. A second TAB program was approved for the Town of Sanford, and has the potential to add 2,000 new customers and approximately $2 million in annual distribution revenue in the Sanford area. In its base rate case Order (described above), the MPUC approved the inclusion of Saco TAB investments in rate base along with a cost recovery incentive mechanism for future TAB investments. 
 Northern UtilitiesBase RatesNew HampshireOn May 2, 2018, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement providing for an annual revenue increase of $2.6 million, a reduction of annual revenue of $1.7 million to reflect the effect of the TCJA, and a step increase of $2.3 million to recover post-test year capital investments, all effective May 1, 2018 (with the revenue increase of $2.6 million reconciling to the date of temporary rates of August 1, 2017 and the revenue decrease for TCJA reconciling to January 1, 2018), for a net increase of approximately $3.2 million. Under the agreement, the Company may file for a second step increase for effect May 1, 2019 to recover eligible capital investments in 2018, up to a revenue requirement cap of $2.2 million. If the Company chooses the option to implement the second step increase, the next distribution base rate case will be based on an historic test year of no earlier than twelve months ending December 31, 2020. 
 Northern UtilitiesFranchise ExtensionsNew HampshireOn October 3, 2018, the NHPUC granted Northern Utilities authority to expand its natural gas service territory in the Towns of Kingston, New Hampshire and Atkinson, New Hampshire (where the Company already had a limited franchise) to serve new industrial, commercial and residential customers. Northern Utilities has also petitioned the NHPUC to extend its franchise into the Town of Epping, New Hampshire, where new commercial and residential developments present the Company with opportunities for growth. The franchise petition for service to the Town of Epping remains pending. 
 
8 


 Granite StateBase RatesOn May 2, 2018, Granite State filed an uncontested rate settlement with FERC which provided for no change in rates, and accounted for the effects of a capital step adjustment offset by the effect of the TCJA. The settlement was approved by FERC on June 27, 2018, and complies with the FERC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning the justness and reasonableness of rates in light of the corporate income tax reductions under the TCJA. The settlement also provides that Granite State may not file a general (Section 4) rate case prior to April 30, 2019. 
Regulation 
 Unitil is subject to comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory authorities. Unitil and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation as a holding company system by the FERC under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 with regard to certain bookkeeping, accounting and reporting requirements. Unitils utility operations related to wholesale and interstate energy business activities are also regulated by the FERC. Unitils distribution utilities are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions, with regard to their rates, issuance of securities and other accounting and operational matters: Unitil Energy is subject to regulation by the NHPUC; Fitchburg is subject to regulation by the MDPU; and Northern Utilities is regulated by the NHPUC and MPUC. Granite State, Unitils interstate natural gas transmission pipeline, is subject to regulation by the FERC with regard to its rates and operations. Because Unitils primary operations are subject to rate regulation, the regulatory treatment of various matters could significantly affect the Companys operations and financial position. 
 Unitils distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or natural gas to all customers in their service territory, at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Unitils distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on a historical test year, and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets. In addition, the Companys distribution utilities and its natural gas transmission pipeline company may also recover certain base rate costs, including capital project spending and enhanced reliability and vegetation management programs, through annual step adjustments and cost tracker rate mechanisms. 
 Fitchburg is subject to revenue decoupling. Revenue decoupling is the term given to the elimination of the dependency of a utilitys distribution revenue on the volume of electricity or natural gas sales. The difference between distribution revenue amounts billed to customers and the targeted revenue decoupling amounts is recognized as an increase or a decrease in Accrued Revenue which forms the basis for resetting rates for future cash recoveries from, or credits to, customers. These revenue decoupling targets may be adjusted as a result of rate cases and other authorized adjustments that the Company files with the MDPU. The Company estimates that revenue decoupling applies to approximately 27% and 11% of Unitils total annual electric and natural gas sales volumes, respectively. 
 Also see Regulatory Matters in Part II, Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and Note 8 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on rates and regulation. 
NATURAL GAS SUPPLY 
 Unitil purchases and manages gas supply for customers served by Northern Utilities in Maine and New Hampshire as well as customers served by Fitchburg in Massachusetts. 
 Northern Utilities C&I customers are entitled to purchase their natural gas supply from third-party gas suppliers. Many of Northern Utilities largest and some medium C&I customers purchase their gas supply from third-party suppliers, while most small C&I customers, as well as all residential customers, purchase their gas supply from Northern Utilities under regulated rates and tariffs. As of December 2018, 79% of Unitils largest New Hampshire gas customers, representing 37% of Unitils New Hampshire gas therm sales and 68% of Unitils largest Maine customers, representing 23% of Unitils Maine gas therm sales, are purchasing gas supply from a third-party supplier. 
 Fitchburgs residential and C&I business customers are entitled to purchase their natural gas supply from third-party gas suppliers. Many large and some medium C&I customers purchase their gas supply 
 
9 


  from third-party suppliers while most of Fitchburgs residential and small C&I customers continue to purchase their supplies at regulated rates from Fitchburg. As of December 2018, 85% of Unitils largest Massachusetts gas customers, representing 26% of Unitils Massachusetts gas therm sales, are purchasing gas supply from third-party suppliers. The approved costs associated with natural gas supplied to customers who do not contract with third-party suppliers are recovered on a pass-through basis through periodically adjusted rates and are included in Cost of Gas Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 Regulated Natural Gas Supply 
 Northern Utilities purchases a majority of its natural gas from U.S. domestic and Canadian suppliers largely under contracts of one year or less, and on occasion from producers and marketers on the spot market. Northern Utilities arranges for gas transportation and delivery to its system through its own long-term contracts with various interstate pipeline and storage facilities, through peaking supply contracts delivered to its system, or in the case of liquefied natural gas (LNG), via over the road trucking of supplies to storage facilities within Northern Utilities service territory. 
 Northern Utilities has available under firm contract 115,000 million British Thermal Units (MMbtu) per day of year-round and seasonal transportation capacity to its distribution facilities, and 4.3 billion cubic feet (BCF) of underground storage. As a supplement to pipeline natural gas, Northern Utilities owns an LNG storage and vaporization facility. This plant is used principally during peak load periods to augment the supply of pipeline natural gas. 
 Fitchburg purchases natural gas under contracts from producers and marketers largely under contracts of one year or less, and occasionally on the spot market. Fitchburg arranges for gas transportation and delivery to its system through its own long-term contracts with Tennessee Gas Pipeline, through peaking supply contracts delivered to its system, or in the case of LNG or liquefied propane gas (LPG), via trucking of supplies to storage facilities within Fitchburgs service territory. 
 Fitchburg has available under firm contract 14,057 MMbtu per day of year-round transportation and 0.33 BCF of underground storage capacity to its distribution facilities. As a supplement to pipeline natural gas, Fitchburg owns a propane air gas plant and an LNG storage and vaporization facility. These plants are used principally during peak load periods to augment the supply of pipeline natural gas. 
 ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY 
 Fitchburg, Unitil Energy, and Unitil Power each are members of the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) and participate in the Independent System OperatorNew England (ISO-NE) markets for the purpose of facilitating wholesale electric power supply transactions, which are necessary to serve Unitils electric customers with their supply of electricity Unitils customers in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts are entitled to purchase their electric supply from competitive third-party suppliers. As of December 2018, 77% of Unitils largest New Hampshire customers, representing 24% of Unitils New Hampshire electric kilowatt-hour (kWh) sales and 81% of Unitils largest Massachusetts customers, representing 32% of Unitils Massachusetts electric kWh sales, are purchasing their electric power supply in the competitive market. Additionally, cities and towns in Massachusetts may, with approval from the MDPU, implement municipal aggregations whereby the municipality purchases electric power on behalf of all citizens and businesses that do not opt out of the aggregation. The Towns of Lunenburg and Ashby have active municipal aggregations. Customers in Lunenburg comprise about 17% of Fitchburgs customer base and customers in Ashby comprise another 4%. Buoyed by the municipal aggregations, 31% of Unitils residential customers in Massachusetts purchase their electricity from a third-party supplier as of December 2018. 
 In New Hampshire, the percentage of residential customers purchasing electricity from a third-party supplier stands at 10%, down slightly relative to prior years when 13% of Unitils residential customers in New Hampshire purchased their supply from third-party suppliers. Most residential and small commercial customers continue to purchase their electric supply through Unitils electric distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs.

 Regulated Electric Power Supply 
 In order to provide regulated electric supply service to their customers, Unitils electric distribution utilities enter into load-following wholesale electric power supply contracts to purchase electric supply from various wholesale suppliers. 
 Unitil Energy currently has power supply contracts with various wholesale suppliers for the provision of Default Service to its customers. Currently, with approval of the NHPUC, Unitil Energy purchases Default Service power supply contracts for small, medium and large customers every six months for 100% of the supply requirements. 
 Fitchburg has power supply contracts with various wholesale suppliers for the provision of Basic Service electric supply. MDPU policy dictates the pricing structure and duration of each of these contracts. Basic Service power supply contracts for residential and for small and medium general service customers are acquired every six months, are 12 months in duration and provide 50% of the supply requirements. On June 13, 2012, the MDPU approved Fitchburgs request to discontinue the procurement process for Fitchburgs large customers and become the load-serving entity for these customers. Currently, all Basic Service power supply requirements for large accounts are assigned to Fitchburgs ISO-NE settlement account where Fitchburg procures electric supply through ISO-NEs real-time market. 
 The NHPUC and MDPU regularly review alternatives to their procurement policy, which may lead to future changes in this regulated power supply procurement structure. 
 Regional Electric Transmission and Power Markets 
 Fitchburg, Unitil Energy and Unitil Power, as well as virtually all New England electric utilities, are participants in the ISO-NE markets. ISO-NE is the Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) in New England. The purpose of ISO-NE is to assure reliable operation of the bulk power system in the most economical manner for the region. Substantially all operation and dispatching of electric generation and bulk transmission capacity in New England are performed on a regional basis. The ISO-NE tariff imposes generating capacity and reserve obligations, and provides for the use of major transmission facilities and support payments associated therewith. The most notable benefits of the ISO-NE are coordinated, reliable power system operation and a supportive business environment for the development of competitive electric markets. 
 Electric Power Supply Divestiture 
 In connection with the implementation of retail choice, Unitil Power, which formerly functioned as the wholesale power supply provider for Unitil Energy, and Fitchburg divested their long-term power supply contracts through the sale of the entitlements to the electricity sold under those contracts. Unitil Energy and Fitchburg recover in their rates all the costs associated with the divestiture of their power supply portfolios and have secured regulatory approval from the NHPUC and MDPU, respectively, for the recovery of power supply-related stranded costs and other restructuring-related regulatory assets. The companies have a continuing obligation to submit regulatory filings that demonstrate their compliance with regulatory mandates and provide for timely recovery of costs in accordance with their approved restructuring plans. 
Long-Term Renewable Contracts 
 Fitchburg has entered into long-term renewable contracts for the purchase of clean energy and/or renewable energy certificates (RECs) pursuant to Massachusetts legislation, specifically, An Act Relative to Green Communities (Green Communities Act, 2008), An Act Relative to Competitively Priced Electricity in the Commonwealth (2012) and An Act to Promote Energy Diversity (Energy Diversity Act, 2016). The generating facilities associated with four of these contracts have been constructed and are now operating. Since 2017, the Company has participated in two major statewide procurements which resulted in contracts for imported hydroelectric power and associated transmission and for offshore wind generation. The contracts were filed with MDPU in 2018 and approvals remain pending.

 Additional long-term clean energy contracts are expected in compliance with the Energy Diversity Act and An Act to Promote a Clean Energy Future (2018). Fitchburg recovers the costs associated with long-term renewable contracts on a fully reconciling basis through a MDPU-approved cost recovery mechanism. 
 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
 The Companys past and present operations include activities that are generally subject to extensive and complex federal and state environmental laws and regulations. The Company is in material compliance with applicable environmental and safety laws and regulations and, as of December 31, 2018, has not identified any material losses reasonably likely to be incurred in excess of recorded amounts. However, the Company cannot assure that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. It is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations could result in increased environmental compliance costs. Based on the Companys current assessment of its environmental responsibilities, existing legal requirements and regulatory policies, the Company does not believe that these environmental costs will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
 Northern Utilities Manufactured Gas Plant SitesNorthern Utilities has an extensive program to identify, investigate and remediate former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites, which were operated from the mid-1800s through the mid-1900s. In New Hampshire, MGP sites were identified in Dover, Exeter, Portsmouth, Rochester and Somersworth. In Maine, Northern Utilities has documented the presence of MGP sites in Lewiston and Portland, and a former MGP disposal site in Scarborough. 
 Northern Utilities has worked with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to address environmental concerns with these sites. Northern Utilities or others have substantially completed remediation of all sites, though on site monitoring continues and it is possible that future activities may be required. 
 The NHPUC and MPUC have approved regulatory mechanisms for the recovery of MGP environmental costs. For Northern Utilities New Hampshire division, the NHPUC has approved the recovery of MGP environmental costs over succeeding seven-year periods. For Northern Utilities Maine division, the MPUC has authorized the recovery of environmental remediation costs over succeeding five-year periods. 
 The Environmental Obligations table below shows the amounts accrued for Northern Utilities related to estimated future cleanup costs associated with Northern Utilities environmental remediation obligations for former MGP sites. Corresponding Regulatory Assets were recorded to reflect that the future recovery of these environmental remediation costs is expected based on regulatory precedent and established practices. 
 Fitchburgs Manufactured Gas Plant SiteFitchburg has worked with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to address environmental concerns with the former MGP site at Sawyer Passway, and has substantially completed remediation activities, though on site monitoring will continue and it is possible that future activities may be required. 
 Fitchburg recovers the environmental response costs incurred at this former MGP site in gas rates pursuant to the terms of a cost recovery agreement approved by the MDPU. Pursuant to this agreement, Fitchburg is authorized to amortize and recover environmental response costs from gas customers over succeeding seven-year periods.
